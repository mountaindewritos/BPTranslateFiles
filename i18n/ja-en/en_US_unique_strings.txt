My son is a big Mount Imagine fan. His birthday is coming up soon. So as a surprise, I would like to deliver a gift using Mount Imagine. I don't have a Mount Imagine, so I was wondering if you could lend me Mount Imagine for a little while.
I'm in trouble. ...... The girl who always delivers our food has been out sick. I'm at a loss for alternatives, and I could really use a cat's help. I need to get the food to various places before it gets cold, so I'm thinking of using Mount Imagine. Can anyone lend me theirs?
I teach self-defense to my kids and train them in all kinds of things. I was thinking of having them compete against Mount Imagine. When the time comes, you are the one who can protect yourself. It is important to exercise and train on a regular basis. So, can I borrow Mount Imagine?
Hey, I've been into Mount Imagine lately!　I've been riding my cool mount to work and it's so cool, isn't it?　I'll show off my mount, too. Can I borrow it for a little while?　This is what Imagine research is all about!　Yo, shh, shh, shh!
We will be conducting a survey in the Evergreen Desert in conjunction with water quality control in the Salamzart area. Since we will be traveling long distances in the desert area, we will need Mount Imagine. If any adventurers can spare some, we would appreciate it if you could lend it to us.
A customer from far away ordered our vegetables. He said he liked the fact that we insist on freshness. So we had to deliver the best vegetables!　Wouldn't it be great if we could deliver fresh vegetables to even the furthest corners of the country with our fast Mount Imagine? It's a business opportunity for our grocer!　We need to borrow Mount Imagine!
I am a poor fortune teller. The other day, my cart with my business tools broke down. I had no choice but to start my business there, but it's not a very nice place. This might be the reason why the cart broke down. I'd like to get around for a while, so could you lend me something to get me around?
Hi!　I'd like to do a new street performance using Mount Imagine. Don't worry, I don't want to go through a ring of fire or anything dangerous like that!　I want to ride Mount Imagine and do tricks on it. If it works, I'll show you, so consider it an investment, please!　See?
Do you know an adventurer named Pissary?　I know him, but he went to "Skyquake Fields" on a request and hasn't come back. ...... She must be lost again, that girl!　Anyway, I'm going to pick him up, and I wonder if you could lend me your Mount Imagine?　If you don't do it quickly, you'll go to a crazy place and I won't be able to find you!
Our milk has been selling well lately. We appreciate that, but we are having trouble keeping our delivery hands full. Milk gets damaged very quickly. Eventually, we will put in place a system, but at any rate, we need to handle the orders that are right in front of us. Can we borrow Mount Imagine for a little while?
I got a request to sing for a consolation prize at a garrison in the Andra Basin. I would have turned them away if they had said, "It's a sacred service, so it's free," but they offered me more than the going rate!　I couldn't let it go like this, so I jumped in my Mount Imagine!　Thank you, God of Bapharia!
I've been getting a lot of inquiries about house calls lately. I want to make a quick turnaround for a quick recovery, so can I borrow Mount Imagine?　A quick turnaround, a quick recovery, a moment for the doctor, and a thankful patient!　What a surprise!　That's why I'm looking for adventurers who are generous enough to let me use their mounts!
I want to feel the wind. ...... I want to be the fastest wind I can be!　If you're an adventurer as good as you are, you must have a real Mount Imagine ...... or even a "True Luck Doubt Weimajun"!　Please!　Let me have a taste of the real thing for once!
A perfect project. ......　The "If you fall down, you're out of business!　An Adventurer's Journey to Salamzart". We can sell this as a book!　First of all, we need to do a preliminary inspection. We need to check the route carefully so that the project doesn't fall apart. I'm sorry, but would you mind if I use Mount Imagine?
I'm looking to fish a lot of spots on the Melissos River. I'd like to make a map of all the fishing spots and the fish I can catch. But I can't go to all the spots on foot, so I was wondering if I could borrow Mount Imagine. Is that a bad idea?　If I catch a lot of fish, I'll share it with the adventurers!
Isn't the classic suspense scenario the scene where you're chasing down a criminal on a cliff?　I'm practicing that, but I can't seem to get an image of it. ...... I think I can figure out what it would be like if I actually went to Shimmering Valley and felt the atmosphere close to the scene of the crime!　But it's a bit far away and I need transportation. Can you help me?
I want to go to "Breathless Wasteland" and I need to borrow Mount Imagine!　My dad has been hunting some great big game. I'm going to go hunt for a catch that's as good as my dad's!　Besides, I want to be able to ride Mount Imagine someday. Please don't tell my dad!　I won't do anything dangerous!
My son, Richter, is about to go hunting alone. I thought I would go check on him without him noticing, but it seems he is going away with his mount Imagine. I had to get a mount for this one as well. ...... May I borrow it for a while?　Please keep this confidential to my son.
The liturgy will be held at the Temple of Bapharia in Salamzart. This time we have priests coming from far away, but the road to Evergreen Desert is a tough one for those who are not used to it. Therefore, we are thinking of picking them up at Mount Imagine. Could you lend us your services to the Order for a time?
I read in a book that there are many ruins on the Calm Eve Terraces. When I asked about the possibility of going to see them, Mr. Isial of the Pioneer Bureau agreed to go with me. But there was only enough Mount Imagine for one person. Could you lend me another Mount Imagine for one person?
I am a person with bad luck on a regular basis, and I am trying various countermeasures. This time, I thought I would bathe in the pure water of "Fiel Pond" to wash away my bad luck!　It's always better to get these things done quickly. Please lend me a Mount Imagine to get to "Fiel Pond!
I tried to come up with a painting based on the theme of "stillness and movement. I thought of stillness as the ruins and movement as Mount Imagine. Mount Imagine standing in the ruins.........!　I can't help but paint it!　That's why I want to bring Mount Imagine to "Galley Ridge Abandoned Road". Is there anyone who can lend me one?
The sand at Cape Rauwehara was so beautiful that I brought it back as a souvenir. However, I lost the sand in the "Hollowed Tempest. But I just can't give up. I will find it somehow!　Anyone who is willing to lend me their Mount Imagine so that I can run around extensively?
This is the Duchy of Bernhardt's army. We would like to patrol the "Rauleben Battlefield," but our mounted imagines are not in good shape and we have run out of them. Regular patrols are the most basic way to keep people safe. I would like to borrow a Mount Imagine so that I do not disrupt the schedule. Thank you in advance.
Ugh, my stomach hurts. ...... My soldiers left for an expedition, and then I received a sealed letter with an arrangement with the higher-ups. If I don't give it to the field, it could be treated as a breach of discipline and punished without my knowledge. I need to chase them down as quickly as possible, so could I borrow Mount Imagine?　Oh, God. It's always like this: .......
I've been feeling somewhat overweight lately. My family told me to exercise and I decided to go for a run, but I don't feel like I can make it to my goal distance. ...... Can I borrow your Mount Imagine so I can get home when I give up?　No, I won't cheat the distance by getting on it on the way!　Really!
Isn't the ocean at Cape Rauwehara clean?　That's because people who notice it pick up trash and keep it clean. It's not that the ocean belongs to anyone, but people do it naturally because they love the ocean. I also pick up trash once in a while. Can I borrow Mount Imagine to carry my load?
I'm going on an expedition with my children to the "Ghost Valley of the Hidden Moon". I was prepared for anything, but I needed this and that, and it turned out to be quite a big baggage. ...... Now I need a Mount Imagine. Can someone please lend me one?
Woohoo, great catch, great catch!　I haven't caught this many fish in a long time!　I didn't expect to catch this many, though, so I'm having trouble carrying them around. I was wondering if you could lend me your Mount Imagine?　We don't always catch this many fish, so even if we hired someone, we'd have extra hands. I'd like to borrow it temporarily.
I asked the adventurers to go to Dragon Claw Valley to collect materials for the perfume, and it seems that they found more materials than they expected. Rather than wait for them to bring them to me, I thought I would go myself. After all, you have to try the fragrance on the spot, don't you? Can I borrow some Mount Imagine?
I'm working on a new invention, but I still need more prototypes!　I want to try out all the ores that can be found in Dragon Claw Valley!　Anyway, I want to bring back a lot of things, so I need to use Mount Imagine. I want to bring back all kinds of things, so please let me use Mount Imagine. I'm sure it will lead to a great invention this time!
Did you know that at the Boroum Ruins you can photograph crystals that resemble flowers, called "Sand Wind Flowers"?　It could be a hint for the design of the heritage site we are currently restoring. I heard a rumor that an adventurer got a hold of it just recently. If you go looking for it a few times, you might be able to find it. Can you lend me your Mount Imagine for transportation?
Supplies are delivered to "Chained One's Spawnery. Because of the convoluted shape of the delivery route, we will utilize mounted imagines, which can be maneuvered in a small radius. In order to complete the work in a short period of time, we will borrow and install a large number of Imagines. Those who can understand this content should respond immediately. Above.
In the "Valley of Machines," many artifacts and relics are excavated. However, there are many objects of unknown use, so we select and remove the ones that look useful. The rest are left behind. Don't you think that's a bad idea?　If this happens, I'll go and collect them at my own expense!　I want to bring back as much as I can, so I need to borrow Mount Imagine!
I have now developed a new hypothesis!　If proven, it will surely overturn ancient history. I am going to check out "Soundless City" for my research, but I can't go through the literature on foot. However, with Mount Imagine, I should be able to hit the literature while on the move!　I would very much like to borrow it!
I noticed that some of the merchandise I carried was missing!　I think I dropped it when I went through "Sunlit Timberpath" ....... Can you please lend me Mount Imagine so I can go look for it right away?　Oh, it is possible that I dropped it somewhere else!　And anyway, I want to go see it right away!
I mainly gather materials and medicinal herbs in the forest, but I injured my leg in a trivial mistake. It will be difficult for me to go into the forest alone for a while. But as an adventurer, I want to respond to requests, and there are people waiting for medicine. If I had Mount Imagine, I would be able to go out to collect it even with this leg. Can you lend it to me until my injuries are healed?
We are going through the "Everfall Forest" for transportation, but we are short on rain gear and are afraid we will get our products wet. It is something we don't use in the desert, so please contact us at ....... For now, we will spread the cloth and make a simple roof. Can we borrow Mount Imagine to walk with us while supporting the cloth?
There's a little legend about "Windsprite's Rostrum. It is said that a herb can be collected that makes one's legs as fast as the wind by simply drinking it. I know it raises some eyebrows, but I find it romantic. However, I am not an adventurer, so exploring is not my specialty. I'd like to take Mount Imagine for a quick trip and come back, so can I borrow it for a while?
One of our regular adventurers is going to a place called "Roseblush Woods" for a long term research. Since he won't be back in town for a while, I thought I'd prepare a preserved lunch for him. I'll ask a friend of mine to deliver them, so please lend me your Mount Imagine to carry the lunches!　Thank you!
I heard that there is a rare insect that only lives in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress!　It's jinxed among anglers that if you use it as bait, you'll catch a big fish. I had to give it a try to show how fascinating fishing can be!　However, I don't know which one is that bug, and I'll catch it at random.
I take care of the transportation of materials found in the "abode of the spirits of the damned. I am often asked to do this by well-heeled people who want something that has a certain significance. I don't really believe in such things myself. By the way, my own Mount Imagine is not working well for some reason. It's interfering with my work, so I was wondering if I could borrow it for a while.
It is said that there is a huge treasure left behind by a famous fallen family in a place called "Thieves' Falls. It seems that some historical documents have actually been discovered. I am not interested in the treasure, but I would like to touch the historical documents. I would rather go there myself than be roughed up, so I would like to borrow Mount Imagine.
Accepted a request to explore "Yellow Sand Cove," but after walking around in the desert, my hair gets stiff. When I got home and took a shower, the water didn't soak into my hair at all, and it took me three times as long as usual!　It takes me about three times longer than usual!　Can I borrow Mount Imagine to get through the desert in one go?
I need to borrow Mount Imagine because I want to get to "The Falling Sun Ancient Trail." The reason is ...... ummm!　My boyfriend dumped me!　I've been serious about him for a long time, but he didn't intend to do that. ...... I have no choice but to run around with my mount!　My mount is not working well at a time like this, please!　Please, someone lend me a mount!
We have received a rumor that there is an unidentified creature in the area around the Castenore Ruins. These stories are usually mistaken, but now that the report has come in, the Pioneer Bureau cannot afford to overlook it. We need to go to the site until we can confirm its true identity, so can we borrow Mount Imagine?　Oh dear. ......
I'm traveling around to document the beautiful scenery of this world. I've been recommended the scenery of the Sands of the Moonlight, but it seems a bit dangerous for a mere traveler. I was wondering if you could lend me a Mount Imagine so that I can go there quickly and come back quickly.　I don't want to take any chances, so please do.
I would like to borrow Mount Imagine to research "Sophra's Mountain Path." This is the place associated with Sopra, a great man of salvation who led his oppressed people across the rugged mountains. We would like to see the area and let our imagination soar as we stage a play based on this anecdote.
I went to "Fiel Pond" to get some quality cooling water. There I saw a strange place. That's the "Arsenal of the Exiled," as they say. I couldn't help but wonder what kind of technology was lying dormant there. I'm just going to look around for a little while, so can I borrow Mount Imagine?　I'll be right back!
I'd like to reinforce patrols of the "miasma mine" and its vicinity. I've talked to the Knights of Bernhardt about it, but they can't seem to get the manpower to do it. For the time being, I'm going to use Mount Imagine and rotate with the current members. I wonder if you could lend me Mount Imagine until someone new arrives.
You will be doing business in front of the Candlemere Tomb. The price is 60 times the market price. Of course, I don't intend to sell. It's a dangerous place, and we have to ask the unprepared adventurers to give up and go home. Some people won't listen to us, so we have to use this kind of trick. Can we borrow a mount-imagine to carry our cargo?
A forest is not just a place where trees grow haphazardly; it is a place that is properly cared for. It's part of the lumberjack's job. It's time to go back to check on things, but there are no roads in the forest. Mount Imagine makes it easier to get around. Can I borrow it for a little while?
The Duke has ordered us to investigate an old formation in the depths of the "Alston Abandoned Mine". Disasters cannot be defeated by the most powerful knights. The best defense is to accumulate accurate knowledge and limit damage. We will be bringing in a variety of research equipment, so we would like to borrow a Mount Imagine for transportation.
Do you know a collector named Studs?　He's got a good eye and knowledge of stone, and we got into a lot of conversation about stone. But I'm a stone craftsman myself. I can't lose. I wanted to surprise him by finding an amazing stone. I'm thinking of going to the "ford of the shelf" to get some rocks.
I want to go to "Giant Tower Ruins." Can you lend me Mount Imagine?　There are a lot of theories about it being a tower, a tomb, a cannon, etc., but I don't think so. That's ...... yes, it's a vase!　It's an out-of-the-way relic used by the majestic gods of Bapharia to decorate the earth!　I'm off and running to find out the truth!
There's a card game that's been all the rage among soldiers lately. But I've lost one of the key cards in my deck in "Leaky Abandoned Mine" ......!　I need to borrow Mount Imagine to quickly retrieve it during a break at work!　Everything depends on that one card. ...... Wait for it, my strongest deck. ......
The newbie adventurer chicks who sleep over at my place left their ...... lunches behind. I'm sorry, young people these days aren't cut out for this. I'm going to borrow Mount Imagine. Hmm?　I'd feel sorry for them if they were hungry!　The lunchbox is getting cold, so I'm going to give it a run for its money!
I did my first "Dragon Claw Valley" investigation!　And I did it alone!　It was a lot of fun, but I had a problem. There were so many materials that I collected that I couldn't carry them without my mount-imagine. ...... I've been reminding myself not to get carried away. I don't have one yet, so can I borrow your Mount Imagine?
For the followers of the Bapharia faith, a pilgrimage to the Pillar of Divinity has special significance. Many people want to see the "Pillar of Divinity" even in their old age. This time, there were more pilgrims than expected and we ran out of Mount Imagine. Can we borrow it as soon as possible?
There is a rare bird near the "Valley of Machines!　As a member of the "Wild Bird Watching Society" team, there is no way for us not to go and see it!　I'm going to visit there with my comrades, and I'd like to borrow Mount Imagine as a means of transportation. I want to see the beautiful form of the bird with my own eyes!
I need a restful sleep. ...... I need a restful sleep, but I just can't seem to get to sleep with all the noise around me. Then a colleague of mine in the garrison gave me some advice. I thought "Soundless City" would be quiet enough, given the name, to help me sleep. I don't want to waste time traveling, so I was wondering if I could borrow Mount Imagine.
Ah, insects ....... It shines as if it were adding a touch of color to people everywhere: ....... As a lover of insects and fascinated by them, my greatest desire is to go insect-watching to my heart's content at Insect Fortress ......!　I am sure I will have a dreamy time. Please lend me your Mount Imagine for my dream!
We, the bandits, have decided to wash our feet. After all this time, we are going to return the goods we have stolen back to where we found them. But if we keep walking on our own feet, we'll never get it done. I know this is crazy, but can you lend us your Mount Imagine?　Don't worry. We won't steal it anymore.
A large amount of materials needed to be transported at "Chained One's Spawnery". Heavy machinery would be inefficient due to the large number of small materials. Although there is manpower, there is a lack of means of transportation and transport. There is an urgent need to replenish Mount Imagine. Anyone who can understand this information should immediately apply for a loan.
We will be doing a major cleaning of the Sanctuary of Blessings. It is a large and important place, so we must not leave any corners unturned. The amount of cleaning supplies, food for the priests, medical supplies in case of emergencies, etc. ...... was too much for one person to carry. I am sorry. Can you lend me Mount Imagine?
I would like to do an in-depth study of the weather. I want to observe the movement of wind and clouds in detail from a high place.

Can you do that for me?
I'm interested in some of the materials that can be found in Dragon Claw Valley. I think it could be a good source of business if it is processed. However, I don't think it will be so easy to obtain. I'd like to see it in person. I would like to borrow a Mount Imagine for transportation.
We are grateful to have received permission to enter the "Pillar of Divinity". Furthermore, we have been allowed to take some of the material back to the site for research. This is also God's will. Even though it is material, we cannot afford to damage it. Can we borrow Mount Imagine for transportation?
Treasures supposedly lost in "Thieves' Falls" have been found. No, I guess it is generally called junk. However, we can infer from these that we may be able to get a clue to the real treasure, can't we?　That is why I would like to borrow Mount Imagine often to transport the pile of junk. Looking forward to a good reply.
It seems that monster activity is increasing in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress" and we dispatch an investigation team. My boss said that we can't ignore it just because of the insects. ...... Ha. Leave the boring boss alone, it's a long way from here, so can I borrow a mounted Imagine for transportation?
I heard that there is a place called "Ballroom of the Water Fairy". As someone who wants to give thanks to the God of Bapharia through dance, I am very curious about the name. It might help me refine my dance and lead me to the next stage. It seems a bit far, so I wonder if you could lend me a means of transportation.
Materials will be removed from "Chained One's Spawnery. These may conflict with confidentiality and will only be performed by authorized personnel. To reduce risk due to the time required for the work, a quick response is required using Mount Imagine. Anyone who understands this content should respond immediately. Above.
My juniors went to the Candlemere Tomb as a test of courage. I told them not to do it because it was dangerous!　Give me Mount Imagine!　I'll go get them right now!　I can bring them back all by myself. I'll beat up the kid who won't listen to me and drag him back. Hmph. .......
I had the opportunity to purify the "Sanctuary of Blessings" and was accompanied by many priests. ...... Everyone was so overzealous because it is a sacred place that is normally inaccessible. The items to be disposed of piled up like a mountain. We can't just leave them in the cathedral. We would like to borrow Mount Imagine so that we can get it out of here as soon as possible.
I would like to bring back some sand and rocks from the Kartoum Sandstone Corridor. The soil there is of very good quality and I often use it to repair walls and roads. But it's just too heavy for us. We'll have to use Mount Imagine to carry it. I've been talking to a few people, and I was wondering if you would be willing to lend me some of your equipment.
I used to be a rider who rode around the world on Mount Imagine. I was especially good at riding in the mountains. I was called "Lightning bolt of the mountain pass" by my friends. I haven't been around since I started a family, but sometimes I get nostalgic for those days ....... Hey, let me relive the old days for a while, will you?
It seems that some troublesome people have entered the "Alston Abandoned Mine. Some bandits or something are up to no good. That's our hideout. We don't want them to escape, so we're going to take them out as fast as we can. I'll get back to you as soon as I can, so can I use Mount Imagine?
I need help ASAP!　I dropped my newly received medal in the sewer!　I can't let them think I threw the medal away. It must be stuck somewhere in the underground canal, and we must find it immediately!　I'll be there as soon as I can, so lend me Mount Imagine!　Oh, and please keep this story confidential!
I have been a security guard at the Drava Royal Research Institute for many years. However, due to my age, I can no longer do what I used to do. It is time for me to leave the job to my successor. However, it is physically difficult for me to stay with him and provide him with guidance. I apologize to my juniors, but I would like to talk with them while riding Mount Imagine. Can I use it for a while?
Various legacies have been found in the "Valley of Machines" and among them are materials related to liquid memory. Your sister asked you to help retrieve them for research and posterity--oh. No, no, no, my senior!　Let's see, what was it? Anyway, she told me to borrow Mount Imagine and retrieve it!　I know it's a hassle, but just lend me some!
I did a lot of intensive monster-killing at the Boroum Ruins. My teammates were trying to make new weapons and needed materials. That was fine, but everyone was so enthusiastic about it that we ended up with a huge amount. Our own mounted imagines are not enough, so I was wondering if we could borrow some for transport.
Currently, we have a team of several adventurers at the Pioneer Station who are conducting an intensive survey of the "Castenore Ruins". It is going to take some time yet, so we would like to set up a supply system. Would it be possible to borrow Mount Imagine so that we can go back and forth between the camp and the site frequently? Thank you in advance.
A large number of weapons discarded by Bernhardt's army were found in the "Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway. It would be a big problem if someone were to steal them. The order was to retrieve them immediately, but there were more than expected, and the subordinates were upset. He asked to be allowed to use at least a mounted Imagine, so we had no choice but to let him. I am sorry, but I would like to borrow it temporarily.
I am a courier in Asterleeds. Recently, a monk came to me and asked to be my apprentice. He's never ridden a mount before. He's motivated and I'm not going to leave him alone. ...... Can you lend me a Mount Imagine to practice with?　I'll keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't do anything crazy.
I'm editing a magazine, and the writer in charge wants to go to "Giant Tower Ruins" to develop his image. I am a former adventurer, so I am fine, but it would be a disaster if he got hurt. I would like to borrow Mount Imagine so that I can escape immediately in case of emergency.
I'm supposed to be working on a request with a fellow adventurer. There are two of us, and we're going to try to get all the different requests done at once. However, this guy is a bit of a stickler for time, and he can't stand even the slightest deviation from the schedule. It's not good for his mental health to go around on foot. I'd like to get a mount for him, but I don't know if I can ask him.
I would like to request the loan of a Mount Imagine for the investigation of the Drava Royal Research Institute. Normally, I could do this kind of mission on foot, but I need my feet because my superiors want me to report every step of the way. I would think that a soldier should run, but my superiors are very picky about that. I have no choice but to ask to use Mount Imagine.
I received a request for a song to accompany the climax of a play, a scene in which adventurers ride Mount Imagine through the Valley of the Coral Rocks, which is a very difficult order. ...... I am going to ask someone I know to actually ride the mount to get the inspiration. Can I borrow it for a little while?
It appears that an unexplored mine shaft has been discovered at the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins." Adventurers broke up a large rock blocking the entrance, but it turned into a considerable amount of debris. There was no telling how long it would take to haul it out by hand. We would like to deploy a number of mounted imagines for efficient transport. Would it be possible to borrow them?
We are devising a route for training new recruits to board Mount Imagine. We need to confirm in advance whether this training will actually work. However, unfortunately, the Knights' mounts have been sent on a mission. Is there anyone who has Mount Imagine and would be willing to help the Knights?
The bridges in Montegnor Valley are deteriorating here and there. The Pioneer Bureau is working with the local residents to repair them. Thank you, thank you. And we're going to need some mounts to transport the materials. If you could lend me some, that would be great. They are not going to close the bridge to traffic, so you can go through as usual.
Oh my god!　A girl I've been corresponding with for a long time is coming over to my house, but I thought I'd never see her anyway, so I wrote a lie saying that I had a cool Mount Imagine at home and that I'd give her a ride sometime!　Can I borrow your Mount Imagine just for now?　Adventurer, you must have a cool one!
I want to clean up the "Alston Abandoned Mine". The mine is closed and no one is allowed to enter, but if something were to happen, it would be dangerous. We don't want strange people getting in. I'll send someone to clean it up. Can I borrow Mount Imagine as a foot soldier?　I want to make sure that only people I trust are involved there. Please.
In a dream, a family asked me to help them. They said they were looking for their father who was killed in the Castenore Ruins. I know it's just a dream, but they asked me to help them, so I can't help it. I'm going to find some relics and offer them to him. I'm going to search through the ruins, so I'm going to need my feet. Can I borrow Mount Imagine?
Thieves are hanging out in the vicinity of the Soundless City. Although they do not seem to go inside, it is a serious matter concerning the dignity of Bapharia as a holy place. After deliberation, it has been decided that we will visit the place in person to explain the importance of the place and urge them to change their minds. Let's do the right thing. We would like to borrow Mount Imagine for the move.
I found a client with a lot of feathers, and he wants me to escort him to see "The Throne of Mayuki". Well, if you go and come back soon, we can work something out. ...... However, it's hard indeed without the speed of Mount Imagine. I'm embarrassed to say I don't have any on hand. Can you lend me some while I'm on the job?
Monster attacks have occurred along the transportation route of the "Red Ore Quarry. It is an important place for the people of Salamzart to obtain building materials and supplies. I and a team of familiar adventurers have decided to reinforce our patrols, but we don't have enough mounted imagines. Sorry, can we borrow them?
I'm planning a maze competition in the Kartoum Sandstone Corridor with some of my junior adventurers. It will also serve as training for exploration. Of course, I will remove any danger in advance, but I want to prepare mounted imagines so that we can escape immediately in case of emergency. My mounted imagines are not enough. Can you lend me one?
I heard that there is a team that is going to investigate the "Sienne Ruins".　The people who belong to this team all have no sense of direction. If we wait for them to arrive, they will become old ladies. Then Mea-chan will give them a special ride to the site. She's busy, too, so can't you let us use Mount Imagine?
My son is a soldier in Bernhardt's army, and he is going on a mission soon to take down a dragon tribe. Even though it is his duty, I am worried about him. I am going to pray for his safety at least until he comes back to his hometown, "Kahuna's Cave. I wonder if you could lend me your Mount Imagine to help me get back and forth.
The trees of the "Silent Forest" in "Koaniani Forest" are protected by the people of the forest. However, it seems that the number of diseased and damaged trees is increasing, perhaps due to the lack of help from the previous generation. I would like to go around and examine the trees, but the tools for this purpose are too heavy for me to carry alone. I would like to borrow a Mount Imagine for transport.
In the Zero Zone of the Tree of Life in Koaniani Forest, there are trees that grow leaves that can be used to make medicines. However, we cannot pluck them from the trees. We have to collect the leaves that fall naturally. The leaves in the forest are so plentiful that it is difficult to distinguish them from each other. We have to just load them up and take them home, so I wonder if we could borrow a Mount Imagine for transport.
The "Hidden Mine of Tomdrum," where bandits and ruffians come, seems to be used for shady dealings. So the adventurers from the Pioneering Bureau take turns keeping watch. But the long hours of watch are making us hungry!　With only a limited number of people to take turns, we decided to stock up on food during our break. Can you lend me your mount-imagine to carry it all at once?
I have a client who wants to use the sand from "Götterdämmerung in the Sea of Sand" for his garden. He says he needs it to express his thoughts. He wants to spread the sand in the garden and draw water patterns. Why not just make a pool with regular water?　I'm going to pick up the sand several times for prototyping, so I need to borrow Mount Imagine for transportation.
You have a nice Mount Imagine, don't you?　Actually, I'm testing an existing Mount Imagine on the "Misty Sea of Trees" course to use as a reference for a new Mount Imagine. That feeling of being in the wind with Imagine ...... hahahaha, I can't get enough of it!　I would love to have your help!　Don't worry, I won't make you feel bad!
My son insisted on crossing the ocean. Well, I was born and raised in Jubilia. A man has to go to sea someday. As a parent, I would just provide him with a good-luck charm. I want to go to the Cave of Kahuna to collect materials that are bathed in the prayers of the land. It's a bit far, and I need to borrow Mount Imagine to get around.
It doesn't make much sense, but the "Zelma Mine Site" is documented to be owned by our family. The mine there is already closed, but if the diary of our ancestor found the other day is correct, we may still find an untouched deposit of ore. Please lend us your Mount Imagine to haul away the debris that has accumulated in the mine for our investigation.
The "Flower Touring Tree Cluster" is a place where grass and flowers grow thickly, and I regularly pull the weeds. So I thought I'd do it for the first time in a while, and I found that the grass had grown more than I had imagined. ...... I've only left it alone for a couple of years, though, right?　The plucked grass is too much for me to carry on my own, so please lend me a mounted Imagine to carry it on.
The "Tuonela Trail" is a treasure trove of flowers and grasses, and is full of flowers with wonderful fragrances!　My mother and I make perfumes from them, and they are very popular among the foresters. However, we had to keep up with carrying the flowers for the materials because of the overlap of orders. ...... Please lend me the flowers for a little while so I can transport them all at once at Mount Imagine!
The Arsenal of the Exiled is a factory of an ancient civilization, and may be related to an ancient city called the Ruins of Augurus. I have visited both places several times for my research, but walking on my own is tiring and dangerous!　I need to borrow Mount Imagine to get back and forth between the two cities!　It's for my research!　Best regards!
I intend to hold a ceremony to honor my ancestors at the "Graveyard of Spirits," but the tools I need are too many and bulky. Only a limited number of people are allowed to enter that place, but we are allowed to have a mounted imaginine loaded with tools waiting at the entrance. That alone will make the preparation easier, so could you lend me your mount-imagine?

I'm Kors.
As an Aegis Fighter, I'm an adventurer who's been doing it for quite a while there.
There are many techniques to learn for the Aegis Fighter who supports the front line and, in turn, the party.
What do you think? How about one thing, why don't you work with me to complete the request?
More or less, they should be able to teach you about Aegis Fighter.
As for me, it's nice to have more people I can count on.
Hi, I'm Kors from Aegis Fighter.
It is said that monsters are haunting Minsterhorn.
It seems he's a belligerent guy.
Livestock and people are intensively targeted.
So they asked Aegis Fighter, who excels at fighting while defending, to come.
It would be reassuring if you would come. Will you lend me your strength?
I need your help again, okay?
The job I'm undertaking now is to deliver "High Helm Beans".
After that, I hear you have another favor to ask. I think I'm going to need a little help.
I don't think it's going to be rough, but it's reassuring to have you here.
Best regards.
Hi. I'm Kors, an Aegis Fighter.
I'm still not sure exactly what's going on around ...... Litze.
I heard that something disturbing is going on.
If something is really going on, they want us to do something about it.
Accepted the request.
Can you help me again with this request?
I am going to head to Litze now and would like you to accompany me.
Kors, Aegis Fighter.
I asked for your help in case of any problems in Litze.
Right?　That something seems to have happened.
I heard that a powerful monster appeared around Litze.
Moreover, he seems to be a monster who has a history with me.
Please. I need your help.
I need you.
My name is Manuel!　I'm a Twin Striker who will one day be a hero!
Are you a Twin Striker too?　Then come on, let's go take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>with me!
Actually, the friend I was supposed to go with came down with a stomach ache.
That guy is a Twin Striker too, so it's easier for us to work with the same Twin Striker coming in.
Let's keep each other's skills sharp!　Best regards!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Accepted a request to take them down. Would you like to go with me again?
I'd like to introduce you to some of my friends.
"There's this guy who's just like the hero we're trying to be, he's awesome!" You know?
Hehe, let me brag a bit about getting to know you.
So, I'm looking forward to working with you!
There's a great trick that our hero Achim used.
It is called "Vortex Impact"!
That's cool!　I'd like to try that technique too!
Find out with me how to make it work!
I'm practicing "Vortex Impact," man. I'm just looking for some more tips.
So I'm thinking of visiting the places associated with our heroes. You call it a pilgrimage to a holy place?
Maybe there's a hint of heroism left there.
Let's go together!
Heroic Achim's Quad Arm Defeat: ....... I've always wanted to do that one day, too, legend.
So I found <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>and something is wrong. If I let it go, it might attack Litze!
Will you fight with me to protect Litze?
Hello!　I am Lily from Blast Archer.
Interested in Blast Archer?
There is, isn't there?　Because you look like that!
Let's follow the path of Blast Archer together!
And oh, by the way, I would be happy to help you with any requests I have Accepted at .......
Let's help each other, Blast Archers!　Hey, let's help each other out!
Hello!　This is Lily from Blast Archer.
I was amazed at how quickly he mastered the bow.
You have a gift as a Blast Archer!
With a little more practice, it will be a great success right away!
Actually, I also Accepted the request to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>just for practice.
Since we're here, let's try it together. Hey, right?
How do you like to practice bowing?　I have something I'd like to try. I would like to ask you to accompany me if you would like.
It is a battle unique to Blast Archer - anti-aircraft combat!
Flying monsters are troublesome opponents, but we can attack them from afar.
Let's train now so that we will not panic when the time comes!
I found him!　It's him!　The Sky Serpent!
A guy from Litze said he saw him on the road.
It was only a short time ago, so he must still be in that area!
Avenge my brother!　Please, I beg you, help me!
I've been looking for "Sky Serpent" for a long time and finally found it!
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>I found his nest in the
If the nest is in the right place, you won't miss it or lose it.
This time we will settle it!　Please fight with us!
I'm ...... what was it, what was your name?
...... Seilah, huh? Yes, Seilah. Yeah.
As Seilah, I have a favor to ask.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>I have to defeat some of them, but I can't do it by myself for some unforeseen reason.
We are in real trouble on all sides.
If you would like, could you please help me, Seilah?
Hi, it's me, Seilah, the Spell Caster.
...... It's complicated.
This time I want to get ore from Asteria Plain and engrams from <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>.
The former, but not the latter, will be fought.
Still, I desperately need them for my purposes.
Please, I need your help. Please do.
It's me, Seilah, the Spell Caster.
So it is I, the Imagineer who possesses Seilah, who is correct? It's getting more and more complicated.
I need your help to correct this situation and return the body to Seilah.
We want to extract an engram from the grave of a great man.
He is like a common ancestor for us Spell Caster's. ...... interested?
It is I, the Imagineer, who haunts Seilah, the Spell Caster.
Can't we do something about this long name-dropping, too?
In this issue, I would like to collect my biological engrams as a Seilah. I found some tools that I used before my death.
But both are monster caves.
We need your help. Can you do me a favor?
I am Seilah, Spell Caster, and this is me, Thrift.
They were really helpful in helping me collect engrams.
He was preparing to return the body to Seilah, but there was not much grace.
They can no longer hear Seilah's voice.
At this rate, Seilah's consciousness will disappear in the not-too-distant future.
This is the last thing I, as Seilah, ask of you.
Please, can you hear me out?
Hey there!　My name is Maschietta. Nice to meet you!
You're a Heavy Smasher, too? It's great, isn't it? The exhilaration of defeating an enemy with a heavy blow!　It's irresistible, isn't it?
Okay, since we're at it, I'll give you a lecture on the Heavy Smasher weapon.
Let's go blow off some steam together at <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>. They say "practice makes perfect"!
Hey, it's me!　It's Maschietta.
How's your Heavy Smasher training going?　This time, I need you to come along with me for a bit of work.
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>At <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>, we took down . Easy, right?
Actually, my mentor told me to learn to cooperate with my friends. You can't do that alone.
I think it would be a good learning experience for you, so why don't you go out with me?
I was going to go away soon to look for my mentor, but I heard something I didn't like.
I heard that the Minsterhorn kid went out towards " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" and never came back.
The people there have taken care of me, and I can't leave them alone, indeed.
I need your help. No?
I went to Larpal looking for my mentor, but there was a bit of a commotion going on.
I'm talking about stored food and packages that were ransacked. It sounds familiar or ...... a bit disturbing.
I need to go to Larpal to check it out. Can you help me?
Remember the luggage vandalism in Larpal?　That's the one the Highland Fox herd did.
I heard that the exact same thing happened again!
I heard that this herd was led by a "sapphire trotter". I remember this guy. I remember him. He was the one I lost to a long time ago!
This time we're going to defeat the Sapphire Trot!
I'm Clint. I'm your senior Blitz Lancer!
You're the new Blitz Lancer, right?
I want to teach you how to fight in this class.
I've been indebted to my seniors too, so now I should be able to teach my juniors well!
First, let's actually try to defeat the monsters.
The quickest way to become stronger is to fight real battles!
Yo!　I'm Clint, a senior Blitz Lancer.
How's the Blitz Lancer training going?
As a senior, I'm going to teach you something new!
But just fighting is boring, right?　I was the same way.
Accepted just the right request at the Pioneer Station, so let's do that and practice Blitz Lancer while we're at it.
It's the duty of the seniors to keep the juniors occupied!
I know this is pathetic, but can you help me?
Actually, I have two requests I have to do right now. It's a strike down and a collection, but I got carried away and took on the job all at once. ......
I don't think I'm going to finish it alone!
Sorry!　Please help me!
Remember the story about the spear called "Zenith Shaft" that my senior is looking for?
There was a merchant who knew about it!
I want to find the "Zenith Shaft". If I can find it before my seniors, I think I can grow a lot.
I'd like to hear what you have to say, and I was wondering if you'd be willing to help me.
It seems that an ogre has appeared in Montegnor Valley.
That's something that's been bugging me. It's close to where the adventurer with the Zenith Shaft went missing.
Moreover, the ogre appeared only recently.
Maybe Mr. Rugel doesn't know yet.
Zenith Shaft" clue, will you look into it with me?
I'm Glen, the beat performer!　Han, I'll be ringing you today!
You're a beat performer too, right?　You sound pretty good!
Beat performers have a lot of charm that people don't know about yet.
It's a new class and we need to show off our guns!
Let's go through the requests with me and see how good the beat performers are again!
I found another request that everyone shunned. I took it on.
Can you help me like you did before?
The client is a druggist from Minsterhorn.
She is a very eccentric old lady, and no one wants to get involved with her.
That's why we're taking on the job!
It's all about improving the image of the beat performer!
Thanks again for your help!
The Pioneer Bureau asked for us by name!
Well, technically, the request was for "Beat Performers Wanted." I was the first one to say yes and take the job!
It's so motivating to think that beat performers are expected to do this!
Since the client is interested, let's show them what we're made of!　Nice to meet you!
This time, the Order of Bapharia asked me to do it.
There are a lot of loudmouths there. To be honest, I don't want to do it either. ......
Nadris called in a request for a beat performer he wasn't good at, and you know what, he got it right.
I felt like I shouldn't complain either.
Let's show them that we're going to answer the cult's request properly!
I got a request from the Bapharia cult, man. They say that there will be monsters on the route of the pilgrimage.
I'm talking about escorting the pilgrims and taking them down if necessary.
It looks like our brother, Nadris, and Nadris' dad will be on the pilgrimage, so this is a great chance to show off!
As long as you show us the results, no one will complain!
It's not an easy job, but let's get into it!

I'm in love with my servant.
Jake's Letter.
Secrets of the Coin-operated Pavilion Owner
Tyris's hobbies
outside world
Oracle Priestess
When I woke up, I was in a place I didn't recognize.
I can't remember anything but my name. It appears to be something called amnesia .......
On the other side was Feste, a young subhuman girl. She seemed to have taken a liking to us after we rescued her from the goblins.
However, I wonder how long I have been her 'servant' .......
The place where he met Feste is a "recently discovered archaeological site". There may be clues to his memory there.
Considering the future, it would be more convenient for me to become an adventurer.
Pass the exam and complete the adventurer registration.
Life as an adventurer began.
Accepting requests, meeting people, and traveling to different places will naturally lead to a search for memories.
First, I would take on the more lucrative job that Jake is willing to introduce me to.
What will it really be about? ......
In "Dragon Claw Valley," he encountered the legendary monster "Avaritia. In addition, a mysterious boy named Merlouf, who descended from the sky, told him about the word "kisha," which means "the coming one.
Are these related to lost memories?
I would like to find out more, but Feste won't listen to me, saying that he is going to the coin pavilion.
Because Jake blew me off that my husband would buy me a drink. ......
I was able to hear about "The Visitor" from the Bapharia priest Walken and his disciple Millene.
The 'visitors' are said to be Gentiles with special powers.
The secret is said to lie in the "Pillar of Divinity," the greatest holy place of the Bapharian religion, which rises in the Bahamar Highland.
At the "Pillar of Divinity," I met Aerinse and Tyris, who came from 1,000 years in the future.
The two will liberate Avaritia and save the planet from the coming doom.
We were to cooperate with it.
Immediately, Tyris seems to have a favor to ask.
Abnormal reaction of engrams that appeared in the omnistron.
It is very likely that it is avaritia.
Help Aerinse and his team to successfully liberate Aberritya.
Request from a coin-operated pavilion owner.
It may seem like a simple errand, but the item to be delivered is said to be so bad that "once you get a taste of it, there's no going back.
Feste, who had been talking mysteriously with a stray cat, suddenly asked him to go and catch some "horngoat meat.
This is also the role of a servant, let's follow without asking any questions.
A simple job of delivering a letter to a priest in Minsterhorn.
But there was a secret hidden there that Jake was not allowed to touch.
The coin-operated husband gave me a wacky job that he was originally going to ask someone else to do.
It would be better to be prepared for some risk.
Tyris suddenly started asking the boy, whom he did not recognize.
Did you catch any significant information ......?
His expression was full of impatience and determination.
Aerinse and Tyris are talking about something interesting.
You may be able to catch a glimpse of the secrets of these two enigmatic people from the future.
A snooty rich man offered me a job.
He says he would like to donate an expensive, rare, and beautiful item that would be of interest to the oracle's priestess. ......

Bahamar Highland Let's talk to Tyris in Larpal.
Bahamar Highland Let's talk to Feste in Larpal.
Montegnor Valley Talk with Feste in Litze
◇　　　　　◇　　　　　◇　　　　　◇
I just finished exploring the "Reikrid Tunnels."
However, I had not heard that such a powerful enemy - an ogre - could be found in the innermost part of the city.
According to Feste, "It's too tough for a fledgling adventurer.
Still, we managed to beat them.
This should pass the test.
Let's report back to Myulie.
Deep in the "Dragon Claw Valley," we discovered a mighty monster and somehow managed to defeat it.
According to Feste, this monster is "Avaritia," a being that lives beyond time and space.
Why do monsters, the monsters of adventure tales, exist?
And what the heck am I who defeated it .......
Jake went ahead to report to the Pioneer Bureau, saying, "I have to warn Avaritia.
Then, a boy descended from the sky.
The boy, who identified himself as Merlouf, left a mysterious tweet, "The Visitor.
What does this have to do with my own memory?
Feste seems to be familiar with the word, but he can't remember it.
For now, let's go back to the pioneer station and get the reward from Jake.
Rescued Walken from being attacked by monsters in "Giant Tower Ruins."
When I asked him about "The Visitor," Walken began to lay out his theory in a furious manner.
The 'visitors' are said to be Gentiles with special powers. It is said that some consider them to be the ones who cause disasters.
Walken advocated that the founder of the Bapharia cult was also a "visitor" from another world, and was left out of the cult's headquarters.
Walken made an impassioned speech, saying that if one examines the "Pillar of Divinity," the greatest sanctuary of the Bapharia religion, one should be able to find out about the "Visitors.
...... Anyway, Walken was able to find it.
I will report this to Millene in the village of Minsterhorn.
On the top floor of the "Pillar of Divinity," Avaritia was sealed.
As they approached, a dazzling sphere of light was suddenly created and two girls appeared from within. Furthermore, Avaritia was unsealed and went berserk, attacking the girls.
Although they managed to fight off the avaritia, the identity of the girls is unknown. They are also strongly wary of us.
And then - and then.
The walls of the room shattered and a new intruder appeared.
Voldigen, king of the largest and most powerful dragon tribe.
Its overwhelming power fed on avaritia and kicked out even the most elite gatekeepers.
Voldigen has his sights set on us and is slowly approaching.
There is no escape, there is no choice but to fight.
At that thought, the girls created a sphere of light. As they called out to me, I jumped into the light.
As I was enveloped in a floating sensation and the light disappeared - Voldigen's figure suddenly vanished, and the avalitia that should have defeated him was sealed in the ceiling.
It was as if nothing had happened.
I asked the two girls what happened.
Their names are Aerinse and Tyris. They escaped from Voldigen by jumping through time through "Chronoleap".
It's hard to believe, but as I was leaving "Pillar of Divinity", I passed "myself and Feste" coming in. ......
They saw themselves in the past. I guess it means that we really jumped through time and went back to the past.
Aerinse seems to be suffering from the effects of chronolepsy.
We decided to return to Larpal to calm down for a while.
I got the parts Tyris asked for.
Let's deliver it right away.
It was still avaritia that responded to the omnistron.
Aerinse performed the "Liberation Ceremony" for the vanquished Aberritya. Surrounded by a solemn myriad of lights, Aerinse led the way for Aberritya to disappear.
It is an entity that arises from a distortion of time and space, killing its past self. That is avaritia.
Only Aerinse can correct the distortion and restore the twisted cause and effect.
But the ritual is also an act that wears Aerinse down significantly.
We decided to return to Litze once more to let Aerinse rest.
After returning from the Cliffside Ruins, I spoke with Jake again, and he introduced me to Myulie, the guide girl from the Pioneer Bureau.
As soon as she saw the "Imagine" she had obtained at the ruins, she recognized it as a "goblin" battle-imagine.
It is not particularly rare, but it seems to have been a lucky find.
To become an adventurer, one must Accept an exam.
Myulie will be in charge, and we will hear more details from her again.
He passed the registration exam and became an adventurer.
Now you can Accept the request from the Pioneer Bureau. However, Myulie advised me to remember to raise my "adventurer rank" as well.
The higher the rank, the better adventurer they are, and the more they are able to Accept requests with higher rewards and go to dangerous places.
You need to complete the "Adventure Board" to rank up. I received the first one from Myulie.
He was also given "GC (Glory Coins)" as a reward for defeating an ogre in "Reikrid Tunnels.
The "Souvenir Exchange" is a place to exchange various items.
Jake said, "If you become an adventurer, I'll give you some good paying jobs."
Let's go see Jake for a report.
Jake gave me the reward for my request and information that I was interested in.
Recently, an unidentified creature has been sighted in various locations. It is rumored to be the Avaritia.
He also said that the period of increased sightings coincides with the time when the dragon tribe began its rampage.
Jake will continue to try to follow up on these information.
Incidentally, the owner of the coin-operated pavilion is also said to offer to buy you a drink to celebrate the accomplishment of your request.
When Feste heard this, he said, "Let's go to the coin pavilion!" and his eyes changed color.
Walken and Millene began a heated discussion about "Giant Tower Ruins" and ancient civilizations as soon as they saw each other.
I'm glad you are well and ......, but I don't think they are going to listen to our questions anymore.
The secret of "The Visitor" may lie in the "Pillar of Divinity".
Let's try to get there next time.
Aerinse and Tyris said that they came from 1,000 years in the future.
The goal is to liberate avaritia.
The mere existence of avaritia distorts space-time, and the accumulated distortion engulfs the planet.
They say that in the not-too-distant future, this planet and the world will be destroyed.
In a time when distortions were still minimal, they could be dealt with. For this reason, the two came to the present day by chronoleap.
However, the chronolipe is a serious secret and should not be known to anyone.
With his sword at the ready, Tyris gave me a choice: cooperation or death.
We have no choice but to cooperate to save the planet.
Both Aerinse and Tyris bowed their heads to our answer, as if it was not their intention to force us to do so.
Thus, he helped Aerinse and Tyris liberate Avaritia.
I am concerned that Feste's mouthpiece even got Tyris to sign a servant contract. ......
While Tyris was repairing the omnistron, I spoke with Aerinse.
It seems that people like these women, who came to the area after chronoleaping, were once called 'comers'.
Aerinse says that he can recognize the fluctuations in the engrams that are characteristic of the "comers. However, she does not see any characteristics that indicate that she is a "comer.
Was Merlouf wrong in what he said?
When the repaired Omnistron was activated, the response was seen in Montegnor Valley.
Aerinse and Tyris are going ahead with the field survey. They were also given an Omnistron child unit for communication.
Tyris apologized and thanked me for what I had done up until the liberation of Avaritia.
In her own way, she had her own share of heartache.
The liberation of Avaritia by Aerinse must continue in order to avert a future of destruction.
However, even the dragon king Voldigen stands in his way. According to Tyris, Voldigen is also an Avalithia, and he enhances his power by eating other Avalithia.
If we do not release Avaritia before Voldigen, the planet will still be destroyed by Voldigen, who has taken its power and distortion.
He promised again to help Aerinse and Tyris to protect the world and save the future.

Montegnor Valley Ritze Tradeway Let's look for beautiful flowers!
Montegnor Valley Deliver the flower crown to the oracle priestess.
First, I greeted the innkeeper.
Let's go to the counter on the first floor.
Feste seems to be a familiar face with the owner of the "Two-Faced Coin Pavilion".
And apparently the bill for lodging is piling up. ......
My husband advised me, "If you're going to leave town, be properly prepared."
The name of the town is Asterleeds.
It is the largest trading city on the Magna continent. The buildings and streets are lined with
Many people are crowded in the area.
It really is a big city.
First, let's head to the "Street Gate Square" at the entrance of the city.
A huge transfer portal is placed in the town gate square.
They said this would get them back to town quickly.
Let's touch the transfer portal and register.
The transfer portal at the Asterleeds town gate square was registered.
Now you're ready to go.
Let's go out of town and look for clues to memory.
Leaving Asterleeds, we found ourselves on a wide open plain.
This is "Asteria Plain".
Various plants, ores, etc. have been found, and the ruins of Bapharia are scattered throughout the area.
And monsters will appear ahead. Be on your guard.
Let's head to "Cliffside Ruins" where we met Feste.
There may be clues to memory there.
I got into a fight with goblins in "Cliffside Ruins".
Some monsters seem to act in packs. Be careful when you fight them from now on.
This back here is where I met Feste. This is where I woke up.
Will we find anything?
In the place where he woke up, he found "Imagine". Engrams and organisms.
They say that it is a crystal that is bound up with the will of the people.
It inhabits various powers, but they do not seem to be memory clues. Other.
There was nothing to be found in the
As I was about to go outside, I thought I heard a strange voice. Shi
However, there was no one there.
When I left the ruins, I met an adventurer named "Jake. Lighthearted language
He is a well-known figure in Asterleeds, and he has a strong sense of adventure.
The company is also said to play a role as a "window dresser" for the company.
Jake promised, "If you're going to be an adventurer, I'll introduce you to the Pioneer Bureau."
He was very helpful. Feste also recommends registering as an adventurer.
You may be concerned about memory, but first, money!" So says .......
However, I am sure that I would be in trouble if I didn't have a job. I went to the pioneer bureau and je
It would be good to hear what Iku has to say.
The assignment was to explore the "Reikrid Tunnels".
It is the site of an old mine in "Skyquake Fields."
Monsters have inhabited the area since it was closed, but the danger is apparently not that great.
If you reach the deepest point, you pass the test.
Reikrid Tunnels" can be accessed through "star vein holes".
The star vein holes are located in various places and are said to lead to various locations such as ruins and caves.
When you find it, remember where it is.
Jake and I were going to go with him to defeat a monster.
A wild boar-like beast has appeared in Dragon Claw Valley. It is said to be "a little bit dangerous," tougher than ordinary monsters.
The request is that the compensation is good for that.
Let's meet up with Jake in front of "Dragon Claw Valley".
I met up with Jake in front of "Dragon Claw Valley."
Explore "Dragon Claw Valley" with Feste and Jake and defeat the monsters.
The "husband buys you a drink" was a trap for Jake to get Feste to have a drink. ......
After a brief argument, Feste brought up the subject of the word "visitors" left by Merlouf.
The husband told me that it might have something to do with the Bapharia religion. However, he did not seem to know the details.
Asterleeds has a huge Bapharia temple.
So I decided to ask about "The Visitor".
Do not speak of 'the visitors' without care."
The priest chided me for this, and I was unable to ask him for more details.
However, a girl who was watching us from behind a pillar told us that if we went to Minsterhorn, we would find out what was going on.
The mysterious girl was gone when I suddenly took my eyes off her.
There are no other memories or clues to the 'visitors'.
Let's follow the girl's words and go to Minsterhorn.
In Minsterhorn, he met a woman named Millene.
As for "The Visitor," she says her mentor, a priest named Walken, knows a lot about it.
However, Walken went to "Giant Tower Ruins" to investigate and never returned.
He accepted the request from a concerned Millene.
Let's go to "Giant Tower Ruins" to find Walken.
Pillar of Divinity" is said to be the greatest holy place of the Bapharian faith, where the founder of the Bapharian faith is said to have alighted.
Because of this, he was turned away by the gatekeeper, who told him that he could not enter without permission.
It seems that no matter how much Feste cajoles and scolds, what is not good enough is not good enough.
Can we get a permit somewhere?
Let's have a strategy meeting at Larpal.
In Larpal, I heard rumors about a Bapharia pilgrimage group.
Recently, the city of Berkmar was attacked and destroyed by a strange monster.
A Bapharia pilgrimage group is visiting to mourn its victims.
Some of the pilgrims are of high rank, such as chief priests and oracle priestesses.
Maybe you can get permission to enter the "Pillar of Divinity".
Let's go to Berkmar and meet the pilgrims.
In Berkmar, he was reunited with a mysterious girl he had met in the temple of Asterleeds.
When I mentioned that I wanted to enter the "Pillar of Divinity," for some reason she gave me a permit.
Who in the world are they?
Before I could question her, the girl walked away again.
Anyway, I got the permit. Let's show it to the gatekeeper of the "Pillar of Divinity.
The gatekeeper could not hide his surprise when I showed him the permit I had received from the girl in the pilgrim group.
The permit seemed genuine. The gatekeeper, after some hesitation, finally let us through.
Now you can enter the "Pillar of Divinity".
Seek clues from "The Visitor" and aim for the top floor.
Tyris and his team have a device called "Omnistron" that searches for avaritia.
However, it seems that it was damaged in the battle at the "Pillar of Divinity".
He asked me to collect parts to repair it.
Head to the "Valley of Machines" to get the parts.
Tyris and his colleagues contacted the child of Omnistron.
It seems to be able to deliver text as well as voice. This is amazing.
Tyris seems to be on tenterhooks being Aerinse's only escort.
Aerinse also told me that he is sorry.
Until they get used to it, it would be better for us to give them a little.
Let's meet up with the girls ahead of us at the Litze in "Montegnor Valley".
Upon arriving in Litze, they were met by a Bapharia pilgrimage group.
There was the girl who gave me a permit to enter the "Pillar of Divinity.
She was Einlein, the "oracle priestess.
We don't know why they helped themselves. Before I had time to call out to them, the pilgrims had gone.
A series of dragon tribe attacks and monster appearances have caused anxiety among the people. Avaritia is one of them.
I hope that liberating Avaritia with Aerinse and others will lead to peace. ......
Now let's follow Omnistron's response.

The next avaritia to be liberated seems to be in the "Soundless City" controlled by the Bapharia cult.
Feste is quite enthusiastic about the possibility of finding treasure at the ruins, which are not frequented by adventurers.
This is supposed to be a story about the world crisis. ......
The next avaritia to be released seems to be in the desert.
The road leading to the desert has a barrier. You must pass through there.
Beyond this point is Evergreen Desert.
It's the setting for a new adventure.
Omnistron's response is out in the desert.
First, let's proceed to the city of Salamzart.
I came to the Temple of Bapharia in Salamzart in search of information about Avaritia.
Now that the light-colored wind is blowing, the omnistron cannot be used.
Aerinse said that the temple might be able to tell us about Avaritia. ......
Charlotte, a diva, met him at the entrance to the desert.
It seems that her Gilwet Traveling Troupe is about to begin a performance.
Aerinse was looking forward to it, and Einlein wants to see it too.
I also have an appointment with Charlotte. Let's all go see the performance.
Carvein and Charlotte were forced to hunker down in a safe house.
Apart from that, Einlein has a request for you.
Seems like something that would be difficult to talk about in a temple.
We met up with Aerinse and the others and talked about Carvein, Charlotte, Einlein and York.
Aerinse and Tyris have a few things on their minds as well.
He said it was an old man, but he was at a loss as to how to talk to him.
Electra seems to have something to ask of me.
Could it be something to do with the Bapharia cult?
After crossing the scorching desert, we finally arrived at Salamzart Oasis.
The best way to relieve fatigue after a long journey is to eat something sweet.
Tyris decided to serve the cake for Aerinse.
Tyris says he has something he wants to finish personally.
I don't know what's going on. ......
Intuiting that something interesting must be about to happen, Feste decides to follow her.
York was in trouble.
In escaping from the insects, he lost a piece of paper that he had tucked into his notebook.
It's a personal journal that doesn't say much, according to .......
I need you to find my missing congregation."
Electra's strangely formal request reveals an unknown side of her.
Veronica, Deputy Commander of the Ducal Order of Bernhardt.
Will the day come when your feelings reach that person in your heart? ......
Avaritia response to Omnistron!
But it was not a target to be released.
Should we defeat him or not? ...... What decision did Tyris make?
Aerinse and Tyris visit Asterleeds for the first time.
With everything they see fresh in their minds, they enjoy a brief respite.
Asteria Plain, let's go to the Order's garrison.
Montegnor Valley Talk to the gatekeeper at the customs house.
Evergreen Desert Let's go to Salamzart.
Salamzart, let's talk to Einlein.

Asterleeds Let's go to the beach!
Asteria Plain Let's talk to Feste at the Order's garrison.
Montegnor Valley Talk to Feste at the customs house.
Salamzart, let's talk to the Grand Master's wife.
Salamzart, let's talk to Aerinse.
Defeated Avaritia in "Soundless City".
When we arrived, one young man was fighting Avaritia first.
Despite his efforts, he collapsed and was unable to move.
While Aerinse is performing the release ceremony, he will carry the young man to a place where he can rest.
The garrison of the Order of Bapharia should be close by. Let's go there.
Defeated Avaritia in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress".
This is another avaritia that should be released. Aerinse steps forward for the liberation ceremony.
At that moment, Avaritia, who should have collapsed, arose with terrifying vitality.
Then a figure swooped down from overhead. With a thrust of his spear, this time Avaritia sank to the ground.
The one who appeared was Dunkirk, the leader of the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt. He seemed to have been investigating these ruins with his subordinates in tow.
After Dunkerque and the others left, Aerinse safely liberated Avaritia.
For now, let's go back to Einlein and tell them not to worry about Avaritia.
On the way home, Tyris was a little slow on his feet, as if something was bothering him. Was something wrong?
Charlotte returned to her troupe mates.
Carvein also left, as he was going to join his friend.
Many things happen and I feel tired.
Let's take a break at the rest stop.
York was the son of Dunkerque, a knight-errant of the Duchy of Bernhardt.
He has known Einlein and Carvein since childhood and they are still close friends.
Apparently, York has something he is personally looking into and Einrain and his team are helping him with it.
However, I was successfully sidetracked as to what it was about. Maybe it is something they don't want us to know too much about.
Einlein's business was done. York seemed to remain here and asked me to drive Einrain back to Salamzart.
The mysterious old man told an old story about a priest.
The priest had a woman he admired. Alicia's blessing" were the words she used to say to him.
The priest searched for the "Flower of the Sand Wind" that the woman sought. In the process, he was surrounded by a dazzling light and landed in a strange land where people, culture, and everything else was different.
And that a long month had passed.
At the old man's request, Tyris smiled awkwardly, holding the "Flower of the Sand Wind" in his hand. The old man, seeing this, nodded his head in sincere satisfaction.
He then said he would deliver the thank-you to the rest stop and quietly left.
Defeated Avaritia in "Whispering Cliffs."
With the light winds subsiding and the omnistrons available for use, this turned out to be the avaritia that should be released.
While Feste had Electra's attention, the release ceremony was also completed by Aerinse.
However, a disturbing shadow suddenly appeared there.
The dragon king Voldigen appeared, and also Electra revealed her true form as the dragon tribe Frelbe.
She infiltrated the Bapharia cult on Voldigen's orders. She then monitored Aerinse's activation of the bio-engraum through the liberation of Aberitia.
Voldigen's goal was to eat that Aerinse and gain power. Aerinse's condition and whereabouts were all being kept in the loop by Hrelbe.
The companions fell helplessly before the overwhelming power of Voldigen.
Aerinse was about to be captured and eaten.
The Imagine Seed that Carvein gave me shined and a beautiful song began to flow.
Voldigen suffered the singing and flew away into the sky.
Before he could catch his breath, Frelbe, who had turned into a giant dragon, attacked him.
After a mortal struggle, she disappeared into a deep valley.
It is no longer in sight.
The threat of the dragon tribe has passed.
Feste, Aerinse, and Tyris all somehow managed to survive.
The recovered young man identified himself as Carvein.
It seems they were investigating something in "Soundless City." He also seemed to have anticipated the presence of avaritia, but how did he know?
Carvein thanked me for saving him and gave me an Imagine Seed, which he said was his most treasured possession.
As soon as I received it, a strange scene flashed in my mind.
A boy is waving a sword somewhere.
Someone is watching over him on the other side of the room.
I suddenly realized that Carvein had already walked away. I'll ask him for more details the next time I see him.
Aerinse and Tyris also joined them after the liberation of Avaritia.
The next destination is the desert. The one with "Salamzart".
They were able to pass through the barrier without incident.
Now you can go to Salamzart.
I look forward to experiencing different places and different cultures.
We arrived in Salamzart.
At the same time, there was a glowing wind that disrupted the flow of engrams. The omnistron was temporarily disabled and the whereabouts of the avaritia were unknown.
Then Aerinse suggested that we go to a Bapharia temple. At the temple, he said, he might be able to get some information about Avalitia.
Einlein, too, seemed to be concerned about avaritia.
He was relieved to hear that there was nothing to worry about.
A cheer went up from the plaza. It seems that Charlotte's traveling troupe of performers is about to begin their performance.
I have an appointment with Charlotte, and Aerinse is leaning forward happily.
Sometimes it's good to let off steam.
I had a strange dream.
--In the forest, someone is holding up a body.
Unable to move, they cry and scream.
"Mother," he said repeatedly--
When I opened my eyes, I found a bag of small money under my pillow.
Then I saw Charlotte's back as she walked away.
Feste had noticed, too, and they followed Charlotte to the entrance of the city.
Charlotte seemed quite concerned that she had been attacked by an armed group. She was trying to disappear on her own, fearing that her troupe mates might get involved.
Then Carvein and Einlein approached me.
They were friends, and Einlein really wanted to help Charlotte. Furthermore, Carvein was a knight of the Duchy of Bernhardt, which was perfect for protecting Charlotte.
Carvein said he had to go into hiding because of the circumstances. He said that Charlotte would also be sheltered there.
Satisfied, Charlotte left town with Carvein. Now she will not have to worry about her.
Meanwhile, Einlein asked me to do something for her. Let's hear what she has to say once she settles down.
Back in Salamzart, Electra caught Einlein looking angry.
As for York, Einlein seems to have managed to cover it up. For the time being, this matter is probably over.
Aerinse and Tyris should have rested up as well. Let's join them.
A young man came to the rest stop who said he was asked by the old man.
I heard that the old man passed away.
What was delivered as a thank-you was a commemorative coin of the Bapharia religion. It was quite old, probably from the time of the founder.
There is no way to verify the truth of what happened to the old man.
The "Flower of the Sand Wind" shattered in Tyris's hand and disappeared.
It was as if they were bidding farewell to the end of a long journey.
It was a long day.
Too many things happen and too much to think about.
Let's rest our bodies now.
Then look for answers.

Let's head for the "Soundless City" in the "Andra Basin".
We arrived in "Soundless City."
Find the treasure and pay off the debt!　Tyris nailed Feste, who was enthusiastic, saying that the first priority was to liberate Avaritia.
Avaritia is in the back.
Let's aim to liberate the second avaritia.
At the customs office, he was asked to present a guarantor.
This appears to be a new requirement, as no one knew about the guarantor.
Dunkerque, the leader of the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt, which has political unrest, is visiting Salamzart and is apparently on heightened alert.
The guarantor must have been a resident of Asterleeds for at least 10 years.
Feste says that the owner of the coin-operated pavilion has been running the restaurant since before then, so there is no problem with him as a guarantor.
We would have to turn back, but we had no choice.
Let's head to Asterleeds.
The husband of the coin-operated restaurant almost mistook me for a guarantor of his debt.
Words like "new servant" and "senior servant" were also used by Aerinse and Tyris, although the husband's eyes grew colder and colder. ......
Anyway, he agreed to be a guarantor with conditions.
The husband is using an Imagine Seed to contact his brother. It has been broken and he wants to repair it.
They need a few special materials and they want us to collect them.
We were able to collect Imagine Seed restoration materials.
Let's deliver it to the husband of the coin-operated pavilion.
The husband of the coin-operated pavilion took on the role of guarantor.
They also provided a deed.
This should get us through the barrier.
Just as we entered the desert, we found a group of travelers fleeing from monsters.
In order to get them to escape, the girls used them as bait to attract the monsters.
I immediately went to help and came across an unusually strong Bapharia priestess. She, too, had heard the story and had come looking for the girl who had been used as bait.
The monsters in the vicinity are taken care of by the priestesses.
Let's find out the girl while we still can.
I was able to save a girl who was being chased by a monster.
Her name is Charlotte. She is the diva of a traveling troupe of performers scheduled to perform in Salamzart.
He said he was confident in his foot speed, but he was reckless.
Aerinse's eyes lit up when she heard about the traveling performers. Charlotte invited her to the performance and promised to go see it.
Charlotte left with her friends who came to pick her up.
Glad to hear you are safe. Let's aim for Salamzart here too.
In the temple was Electra, a priestess he had met in the desert.
She says that she is a guard for Einrain, a priestess of the oracle. However, Einrain has wandered off and she is looking for her.
According to Aerinse, "a priestess of the oracle would have detailed information about avaritia.
I had to help Electra to find Einlein.
Einlein was playing with children behind the pioneer station.
He told a story about a "beast" that once destroyed the world, but it seemed to bore the children.
In his place, Feste sang a beautiful song.
The sound attracted not only the children but also Einlein.
Feste was teaching a song, and then Electra came along.
When I asked Einrain about Avaritia, who was being brought back to me, he told me that she was in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress".
Why did Aerinse think that the oracle priestess knew the whereabouts of Avaritia?
I did not get a clear answer from her.
Charlotte's stage began amidst cheers.
But it quickly turned into a scream.
An unidentified group of armed men suddenly attacked her in an attempt to kill her.
Charlotte fled out of town. A group of armed men also chased after them.
I don't need Einlein to tell me that.
We must go to help Charlotte immediately.
It was Carvein, whom she met in "Soundless City," who protected Charlotte when she was cornered.
Working together, they were able to kick out the armed group and save Charlotte.
Tyris, who had rescued the injured, joined them. The town is said to have regained its calm.
However, Charlotte has no idea that her life was threatened, apparently.
On his return to Salamzart, Carvein dropped off an old button. He said it was a clue left behind by a group that once took his mother.
Carvein may have some complications.
Einlein wanted to see his friend, a secret even from Electra and the others. He wanted to ask them to be his escort.
Let's take her to the "Hermit's Fountain" in Evergreen Desert.
There was no sign of Einlein's friend York at the Hermit's Fountain.
Instead, his handkerchief, footprints, and a dead insect were left behind.
York is not a big fan of insects and says that even the smallest ones make his blood boil. And if he were attacked by a large insect monster, his life might be in danger.
Let's hurry up and find York.
An insect monster appeared at the end of York's trail.
I wonder if York is safe.
After defeating the swarming insects, a young man emerged from the shadows.
This is York. He escaped from the insects and was safe and sound. He seemed to be a bit strong to Einrain who was worried about him.
I don't want to stand here and get attacked by bugs again.
Let's go back to the safe tent.
An old man in Salamzart said that he may have been chronoleptic.
If so, we can't just let it go.
Let's talk to the old man, just to be sure.
The old man was in a bar and mumbled, "Alicia bless you .......
Definitely a chronogate activation word.
When the old man saw Tyris, he suddenly became conscious and clear. He was so startled that he seemed unable to speak.
The old man asked me to deliver him a "Sand Wind Flower". It seems that it was someone's favorite flower.
He promised to tell me everything he knew if I gave it to him.
The "Flower of the Sand and Wind" is created by chance by the desert winds, and it is not even clear where it is located.
Let's ask Einrain to help us here. The Bapharia cult's information network might be able to catch something.
We were able to hear from Einlein and Electra.
It was a few years ago, but "The Flower of the Sand Wind" was once found at the "Boroum Ruins".
I got the "Flower of the Sand Wind" at the back of the "Boroum Ruins".
The beauty of the scene caught the eyes of Aerinse and Tyris. They were both so moved that their bodies shook.
I wonder if that old man also sought this out of beauty.
Deliver "The Flower of the Sandwind" to an old man in Salamzart.
Electra asked me to take down Avaritia.
They concluded that avaritia appeared in the order of the pilgrimage and that it was better to defeat them than to bypass them.
Einrain told me that the story of the defeat of Avaritia in Insect Fortress came to Electra's ears and led to the request.
Feste was also rounded off with a single word: "I'll take off the gratuity.
Regardless, we cannot leave Avaritia alone.
Meet up with Electra and head out to defeat Avalitia.
Avaritia said he appeared in "Whispering Cliffs".
Electra spoke up and said that the Order should take responsibility for the avaritia as it should be.
The Bapharia cult has sealed Avalitia in a holy place and is recovering and using a vast amount of engrams from it.
I could not hide my surprise at the unexpected truth. Electra quickly minced words, but it was too late.
Aerinse also seemed to know the connection between the Bapharia cult and Aberritya. Come to think of it, Abaritia was also sealed in the chronogate of "Pillar of Divinity.
Aerinse will tell us what's going on after this Avaritia one.
Now let's go to "Whispering Cliffs" and defeat Avaritia.

He survived fierce battles not only with Avaritia, but also with the dragon king Voldigen and the dragon tribe Frelbe.
Let's take some rest now.
Aerinse was taken to the future by Bachelard.
According to the voice I heard from Imagine Seed, Aerinse is going to be used in some 'plan'.
Aerinse's life is in danger if this continues.
Go with Tyris to the future and rescue Aerinse.
Tyris was taken in by the avaritia shell, chronolept and disappeared.
They must be somewhere in this time period.
It seems that Merlouf knows where the Avaritia Shell appears.
In the future, he said that in this era he would be in Asterleeds. ......
Avalitya Shell is believed to be in the "Sanctuary of Blessings," an important center of the Bapharia cult.
The only way to get there is to use the transporter in the temple in Asterleeds.
We would have no choice but to ask permission to use it.
Let's talk to a high priest in the temple.
It seems that Lugerio has some kind of request.
There is a lot to know about what has happened since the avaritia shell appeared in the cathedral here too.
Let's hear what they have to say first.
Jake is put in charge of the coin pavilion and struggles with the unfamiliar job.
Feste, who couldn't see it, offered to help.
Of course, we would receive compensation, but above all, if the coin-operated pavilions were to go out of business, there would be nothing to be gained.
The leader and his wife of the traveling troupe "Gilwet" were worried about Charlotte, whom they had loved like their own child.
Let's try to respond to their wishes and find a way to get in touch with Charlotte.
Top adventurer Jake continues to receive requests for his services.
He is unable to make time to run the coin-operated pavilion, so I take one of his requests on his shoulders.
Well, what is the content!
Demi-dragon appears in Asteria Plain!
The adventurers are suddenly excited.
Those who sniffle to make a name for themselves.
Those who shy away from the idea that they are incapable of doing so.
In the midst of all this, that boy appeared dashingly with them in his sights.
The sudden order to return was given to Tyris and Aerinse.
Please visit ...... at least for a side trip to make memories of this era.
What is their last wish?
Aerinse inadvertently broke an omnistron.
Now that he cannot rely on Tyris, Feste is at a loss.
But the Princess of Bapharia was undaunted and chose to rise to the challenge.
Evergreen Desert Let's go to the Khartoum Ruins
Sanctuary of Blessings Let's go to the Room of Purification
Asterleeds, let's go near the two-sided coin pavilion.
Asteria Plain, Minster Hills, look for Merlouf.
Asterleeds Let's go to the Temple of Bapharia
Evergreen Desert Talk to Feste at the Khartoum Ruins
Asterleeds Let's go to the Temple and talk to the priests.
Before returning to the future, Aerinse revealed the truth.
She is the princess of the divine tribe of Bapharia.
The "gods" who once built advanced civilizations and created human beings still live beyond the sky.
They are directing the Bapharia cult through an oracle to retrieve the engram from Avalitya, which is sealed in the Holy Land.
However, the resulting distortion caused by avaritia accumulated and led to the destruction of the planet.
Aerinse wanted to release this causality and seek a new future.
Even though it was only for a short time, Aerinse told me that they "enjoyed" the trip with them.
There was a gleam in Feste's eye when she heard this.
At the Chronogate on the top floor, Bachelard was waiting.
The face was familiar. It was the man I had seen in my dream - the man who had taken the crying boy's mother.
Bachelard took one look at us and attacked without saying a word. Tyris was also punched away and Aerinse was put into a coma.
And Bachelard took only Aerinse with him to chronoleap.
Where I was left behind, I heard a voice from Imagine Seed.
Help Aerinse, she is being used for 'the plan'."
The voice does not answer the question. However, we cannot leave Aerinse like this.
The way to the future, Charlotte says, is open to us.
Let's hurry to the Khartoum ruins to meet her.
In addition to Charlotte and Carvein, Einlein and York were also present at the Khartoum site.
The oracle came to Einlein and said they were waiting for him here.
Charlotte followed the oracle and entrusted me with the pendant.
Inside were chronograms of such high purity that Tyris was surprised. He said that even if they all did chronoleaps, they still had enough power to make more.
As long as we have this, we can help Aerinse out.
He thanked Charlotte and the others for their help, and then he was off to the future from the "Pillar of Divinity".
I could see the laboratory where the avaritia shell was installed.
Already in the final stages, a black haze began to extend from the avaritia shell to Aerinse at Bachelard's signal.
Tyris jumped in and rescued Aerinse in the nick of time. This time, however, Tyris was caught in the avaritia shell.
Alarms sounded and Bachelard gave the order, but the avaritia shells did not stop moving.
Unable to reach Tyris's outstretched hand, she was swallowed up in the avaritia shell.
The next moment, the avaritia shell seemed to glow with a blinding light, and then vanished without a trace.
According to Bachelard, the Avaritia shell jumped from here to 1000 years ago - - to their own time. Moreover, the effect of the jump has disrupted space-time, making it impossible to chrono-leap and follow it.
In the middle of the impasse, Merlouf came to me with Hrelbe. He understood the whole situation and said, "I will make it possible for you to do chronoleap.
I went to the chronogate with half a doubt and found that the space-time was indeed stable. This would make chrono-leap possible.
Bachelard proposed a partnership with the goal of capturing Avaritia Shell.
Aerinse had a hard time nodding his head emotionally, but he gave priority to saving Tyris and accepted the proposal. Bachelard's support, including the preparation of the chronogram, was essential to the rescue of Tyris.
He left Hrelbe on watch and again chronolied with Aerinse.
The destination is our own time.
We need to find Avaritia Shell and Tyris, who are supposed to be there.
They interviewed people in town and found Merlouf.
About six months ago, Merlouf sensed an unusual occurrence of engrams in the "Sanctuary of Blessings" under the island of St. Bapharia.
Probably due to avaritia shells.
According to Aerinse, the Avaritia shell jumped through time and space without using a chronogram. It is believed that this caused the time period to shift and history to move in the space of six months.
The Sanctuary of Blessings is an important center of the Bapharia religion. The only way to get there is through the temple in Asterleeds.
I don't know if I can get permission, but let's go to the temple anyway.
We found an avaritia shell in the innermost part of the "Sanctuary of Blessings."
Einlein has set up a ward to contain the avaritia shell. It will no longer be able to move around on its own.
Tyris is half-buried and half-asleep in the avaritia shell. They have not yet fully fused.
However, one day the avaritia shell will wake up and take in Tyris.
Before that can happen, we must find a way to isolate Tyris.
Otherwise, the world will face a future of destruction.
If there was no way to rescue Tyris--
If you can't avoid a future of destruction - what will you do?
Find the words to answer Feste's question.
What will I find at the end of this world and this journey?

A person named Bachelard contacted Tyris. It seems that he had sent instructions to Tyris from 1000 years in the future.
After reporting the Voldigen incident, Bachelard was concerned for Aerinse's safety and ordered her to return to the future.
The release of Avaritia will also be suspended in order to prioritize Aerinse's safety.
Tyris asked me to drive them to the "Pillar of Divinity" as a "last request".
Once they return to the future, they will never see each other again.
I'm sad to say goodbye to you now, but it's ...... inevitable.
We are ready to leap into the future.
Let's head for the Chronogate of "Pillar of Divinity.
Tyris told me about Aerinse and Bachelard.
Bachelard and Tyris belong to a thought group called "Zolksia" within the Bapharia theosophical clan. Tyris' original mission was to escort and monitor Aerinse.
However, as he got to know Aerinse's personality, Tyris was drawn to her and came to serve her wholeheartedly.
Tyris' desire to help Aerinse is genuine. I am sure that Aerinse knows this.
After the chronoleap, we finally came to the future, 1000 years later.
Let's hurry to Aerinse.
A thousand years later, at the "Pillar of Divinity," he was reunited with Frelbe, a dragon tribe.
She has lost her memory of this period and is said to be serving Aerinse with Tyris.
Hrelbe was also about to head to the research facility to help Aerinse, who had been kidnapped. When I accompanied him, Hrelbe told me about Bachelard's plan.
It is the "Avaritia Shell Project".
The idea was to fuse Aerinse with a special "avaritia shell" to control other avaritia.
Of course, there were many dissenting opinions, and it was finally settled that Aerinse would liberate Avaritia.
However, even this was Bachelard's intention. As a result of releasing the avaritia and activating the biological engram, Aerinse was more easily fused with the avaritia shell.
The fusion of Aerinse and Avaritia Shell is still underway.
We must reach the research facility as soon as possible and stop the project.
I reached the first floor of the "Pillar of Divinity. However, the entrance to the research facility is closed.
Then Bachelard's image was projected.
Bachelard is only trying to move forward with the Avalitya shell project. It was not to control avaritia.
The real purpose of the "Beast of the Planet" is to destroy an overdeveloped civilization.
Controlling the beast, which was not a fairy tale but a real thing in an imaginary world, was the whole point of the Avaritia Shell Project.
Bachelard tells her that the sacrifice of Aerinse alone is unavoidable in order to protect the planet and civilization. However, Tyris does not accept this and clearly states that he wants to save Aerinse.
The soldiers Bachelard sent for were taken care of by Hrelbe. He said that the research facility could be reached by following the tracks where she had once gone on a rampage.
We are one step closer to helping Aerinse.
There does not seem to be any noticeable change in Asterleeds.
It seems like a lie that we have gone to the future.
Let's go to the coin-operated pavilion to gather information as well.
When I arrived at the coin-operated pavilion, the owner was just about to leave.
Jake is taking care of his absence, but there was talk of closing the restaurant at one point. Her husband will be gone for a while.
When I inquired, Jake told me a startling story.
King Bernhardt was assassinated during an attack by dragon tribes. Moreover, the main culprit was Carvein, who was even listed on the wanted list.
The Lord King was supposed to have been recuperating from an illness. There is no evidence that he was assassinated in the attack by the dragon tribe, and of course Carvein would not have assassinated him.
However, a discrepancy with the history they know is occurring.
After all, there may have been some influence by avaritia shells.
Let's find Merlouf right away and ask him where Avaritia Shell is.
In the temple, the chief priest, Lugerio, was waiting for him.
He easily gave me permission to use the transporter and told me to go to the "Sanctuary of Blessings".
Einlein Accepted the oracle, and the Bapharia Order is willing to cooperate fully.
I heard that Einrain is also in the Sanctuary of Blessings. Let's go there and ask him for more details.
In the Sanctuary of Blessings, Einlein had set up a ward.
He said it was to put to sleep the "angel of God" who appeared six months ago.
It should be staked closer to the angel, but the monster inside is blocking the angel from approaching.
The oracle Accepted by Einlein was to "eliminate that monster and suppress the wrath of the angel." Hearing this, Aerinse guessed that Bachelard had given instructions to the Order in the form of an oracle.
In any case, there is no doubt that Tyris and Avaritia Shell are here.
In order to help Tyris, we need to go to the innermost part of the building.

We need to find a way to get Tyris off our backs while we still can.
Tyris is asleep and doesn't seem to be in any trouble right now.
Einlein is by my side.
This Einlein, however, seems to be concerned about Carvein and Charlotte at the safe house.
First and foremost, Einrain must be rescued.
But it is difficult to get help from a confused cult.
We will have to infiltrate the Principality of Bernhardt ourselves.
The route of entry into Bernhardt Castle as told to me by the owner of the Coin Pavilion.
Is this information certain?
If correct, we can move forward quickly to rescue Carvein and Einlein. ......
Finally, we were ready to make our way to Bernhardt Castle.
The goal is "Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway".
They should be able to get into the castle under the watchful eye of the knights.
In order to clear Carvein and Einlein of suspicion and put the whole situation behind us, we need to talk to Dunkirk.
Let's go for the Oval Office in Dunkirk.
Dunkirk said he is at the "Drava Royal Research Institute".
He says that is where the truth about Carvein lies.
There is a lot of noise in the temple.
Aerinse is talking to the priest about something with a serious look on his face.
It seems that the Duchy of Bernhardt's declaration of war against the Order is not the only reason.
Carvein was entrusted by Duke King Norbert to organize the documents and other materials left at the Drava Royal Research Institute.
It doesn't look like much work, but his expression is heavy.
What in the world happened to ......?
Einlein had a promise to fulfill.
In order to do so, he said, he really needs to meet with Carvein.
Let's escort her to Bernhardt Castle.
I saw Carvein with an unflattering look on his face.
He is now hailed as a "hero" who saved his country from a crisis, but why is he here?
An old friend of the husband came to visit him at the coin-operated pavilion.
He began telling old stories without being asked.
Together with Feste, who showed a rare interest, let's get to know the unknown past of the coin-operated pavilion owner.
Charlotte heard rumors of a bandit who attacked only traveling entertainers.
Intuiting that it was the same armed group that had targeted her, she took action on her own.
Einlein entrusted me with a letter.
From: Carvein, to: Charlotte.
...... I thought it was just a casual, mundane errand!
Asterleeds, let's talk to Lugerio.

The "Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon" avalitaire was liberated.
It does not directly lead to the rescue of Tyris, but it is where the future would have been adversely affected if left unchecked.
This avaritia information was conveyed by Bachelard.
He would have originally opposed the liberation of Avaritia. Nevertheless, this time he proposed liberation.
Is it because the future situation is that bad? ......
Aerinse is worn out by the liberation ceremony.
Let's go back to Litze and let Aerinse rest.
It seems that something unusual is happening related to the cult, after all.
Anyway, let's head for the temple.
He informed Bachelard that he had liberated Avaritia.
The immediate problem seemed to have been averted. But the future of ...... destruction was closer than imagined.
According to Bachelard, the future is no longer observable.
The fusion of Avaritia Shell and Tyris has led to a situation where the world could be destroyed at any moment.
Bachelard also attempted to alter the past by chronoleaping, but this failed with significant loss of life.
The only way now is to somehow get Tyris away from the avaritia shell.
Let's go back to check on Tyris.
Lugerio gave me a shocking story.
The Duchy of Bernhardt declared war against the Order of Bapharia and raided the "Sanctuary of Blessings".
The duchy's argument is that the Order is a heretical and dangerous group that used Avaritia and also pulled strings to assassinate the duke.
He also said that he was even taken to Einlein for helping Carvein, the assassin.
The wards surrounding Avalitia Shell have lost their power. The Sanctuary of Blessings was sealed off, and Tyris could not be reached.
At this rate, it is only a matter of time before Tyris will be taken into the avaritia shell and face a future of destruction!
While canvassing in Kanaloa, I saw a hooded woman standing in the harbor.
As she held up her hand, a strange scene appeared in her mind.
Scenes of horrific battles and a dying world.
One word I heard in that context.
You can change the future."
When I came to, the woman was nowhere to be found.
Then Feste arrived with a letter.
The sender is the owner of the Coin Pavilion. The contents are the route to Bernhardt Castle.
I don't know how the husband would know such information.
But that's the only clue we have right now.
I got the key at the "Alston Abandoned Anti", as the husband's letter said.
This should allow us to sneak into Bernhardt Castle through the underground canal.
However, the Bernhardt Knights were on high alert. So Charlotte proposed a diversionary tactic.
Charlotte and Jake would act as decoys to attract the Knights in a separate operation, while Carvein and the others would be rescued.
With Jake with us, we would be safe and the diversion would work.
From this point on, there are two sides to the story.
Let's do everything we can to rescue Carvein and Einlein.
After breaking through the old underground canal and passing through a hidden door, we found ourselves in a prison.
They succeeded in knocking out the soldiers on guard and freeing Carvein and Einlein.
For the time being, they both seem to be safe.
But - the tragedy was happening in their own unknown history.
Their best friend, York, had died two months earlier. This is why York was unable to do anything about the crisis Carvein and his family were in.
May God bless you all in your fight."
The young man who prayed so has disappeared into altered history. ......
As he tried to escape from Bernhardt Castle, Carvein wanted to talk to Dunkirk.
Running away like this would solve nothing. Besides, if Dunkirk has lost his way, the only one who can stop him now that York is gone is Carvein, whom he treated like a son.
Carvein's eyes held a steely determination.
Standing in the courtyard was the vice-commander Veronica.
She, also known as Dunkirk's right hand, considered us to be a complete enemy.
All for Dunkirk.
With that one thought, Veronica continued to swing her sword until she ran out of strength.
Just before she lost consciousness, enigmatic words spilled out of Veronica's mouth.
The abominable blood that flows in Carvein killed York and drove Dunkirk mad."
I don't know what it meant, but it sounded ominous to my ears.
Aerinse was waiting for him in the temple in Asterleeds.
According to her, the future situation is looking up. Apparently, the death of Dunkirk was one key to avoiding destruction.
When I got to the Sanctuary of Blessings, Einlein had reestablished the wards and the Avaritia shell had finally regained its stability.
Not only that, but Tyris responded to our call!
He did indeed speak, "...... ahead, tai ......."
I have a faint glimpse of a way to get Tyris out of there - and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.

On the other hand, a bloated avaritia was also identified, perhaps due to the appearance of avaritia shells.
It seems that Aerinse's power must liberate the avaritia that appears in "The Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon."
According to Einlein, they have lost contact with Carvein and his group.
They said that their hideout is in the "Kartoum Sandway" near the ruins of Kartoum.
Let's make sure they are safe and reassure Einlein.
The Knights of Bernhardt were in the safe house.
It seemed to have come to capture Carvein and attacked us as well, but we managed to turn back.
Carvein and Charlotte seemed to have sensed it beforehand and fled. They were not at the safe house.
As he left, the Knights of Bernhardt mentioned something that bothered him.
"I should have played with the cultists so I could have gone on a clear rampage." .......
Did something happen with the Bapharia cult?
The air in Asterleeds is a bit hectic.
First, we decided to talk to people in town.
The only way to get to the Duchy of Bernhardt is by sea.
For that we need a boat.
However, I wonder if there is a ship that would be willing to sneak themselves in under the circumstances. ......
Jake is the best person to talk to about these things.
Let's visit Jake at the Coin Pavilion.
I left Aerinse at the temple and visited the coin pavilion.
To my surprise, Charlotte was there.
The two men were said to have escaped from the lair of the Khartoum ruins in the nick of time, having detected the movement of the Bernhardt Knights.
Carvein went straight to Einrain's rescue, alone.
Charlotte was told to go into hiding, but she couldn't stand still and consulted with the Pioneer Bureau, where she was introduced to Jake.
I want to help Carvein and Einlein."
Charlotte's sincere wishes moved Jake as well.
A ship to the Duchy of Bernhardt will be prepared, and Jake himself will accompany the ship. He is also willing to take two more people on board.
As expected of a top of the line adventurer. Dependable.
Meet up with Jake and his group at the port of Asterleeds.
Thanks to Jake, the boat is ready.
But they say they can't get enough sailors.
We have limited time and it would be faster to find them ourselves.
Find someone in the city of Asterleeds to take you on a boat ride.
We were able to find people willing to serve as ship's crew.
We can't afford the luxury of a hodgepodge.
This will take you to the Duchy of Bernhardt.
Let's report back to Jake.
Finally, the ship is ready to sail!
We arrived at "Kanaloa," a fishing village on the West Bernhardt Peninsula.
There, the date of Carvein and Einlein's execution was prominently posted.
The two appear to be held captive in the castle's prison.
I am not concerned about what the situation is.
I'd like to go help them right away, but I'm dealing with the valiant and audible Bernhardt Knights.
If you go in head-on, you have very little chance of winning.
First, let's hear from the people of Kanaloa and formulate a plan of action.
Bernhardt Castle has an "Old Underground Waterway" that leads to the interior.
It is already closed, but the key is said to be hidden in a cave called "Alston Abandoned Anti".
The letter is detailed and I can find no reason to bother lying.
Let's trust the husband here and head for "Alston Abandoned Anti".
On the way to the "Alston Abandoned Anti" we came across the Bernhardt Knights.
Just as they were considering a forced breakthrough, a dragon tribe calling itself Leanbluhm flew in from the sky above.
Leanbluhm's tone sounded as if the dragon tribe and the Knights of Bernhardt were in a cooperative relationship and the knights followed the dragon tribe.
Then, for arguing with his orders, Leanbluhm spat out a deadly poison and flew away, taking the lives of the Knights. ......
What is going on in the Principality of Bernhardt?
We must get the key to the "Alston Abandoned Anti" as soon as possible to find out the truth.
Dunkirk was at the far end of the "Drava Royal Research Institute.
They stood calmly, as if they knew we were coming.
Carvein is not the assassin of the Prince.
This was admitted by Dunkerque himself. He then said that Carvein and Einlein must die, and called the deformed monster to the spot.
The changed figure is - York.
It was the beloved son who had been transformed into Avalitia by a part of the Bapharia cult and whom Dunkirk had defeated without knowing it.
After a fierce battle, Dunkerque fell to his knees.
Carvein asks for the truth. Dunkirk does not answer, but shows Carvein a dagger, a memento of his mother.
If it weren't for that, I wouldn't hate you. ......
As soon as he said it, Dunkirk grabbed his dagger and slit his own throat.
The most powerful knight of mankind sank into a sea of blood, covered in unspeakably deep despair and unspeakable rage.
When I left the "Drava Royal Research Institute," Veronica, who had regained consciousness, was standing there.
She told the whole story of Dunkirk's handiwork on York.
Some adherents of the Bapharia cult were trying to create an artificial "pseudo-avaritia".
It was not originally supposed to be made, but the advent of avaritia shells led to more research, and York sacrificed his life.
After defeating them and learning the truth, Dunkirk exploded in anger against the cult and the Bapharia gods.
And another reason that drove Dunkirk to despair.
That was Carvein's dagger.
The dagger, a memento of his mother, belonged to the divine tribe of Bapharia.
Carvein was of Bapharia's divine blood.
Veronica laughed out of the ordinary as she revealed the shocking truth.
The dragon tribe Leanbluhm took her form.
They say that he ate Veronica and stole her appearance and memory.
Leanbluhm flew away, leaving Carvein in a rage.
The inescapable truth weighs heavily on the heart.
Is it true what Leanbluhm said?
Let's go see where Veronica was.
The man in the courtyard was the owner of the coin-operated pavilion.
At the same time, it is also King Norbert of the Duchy of Bernhardt.
The husband and the duke were the same person.
By King Norbert, the series of events was settled as a rebellion by Dunkirk, who plotted to usurp the throne.
The truth is complicated.
However, the decision was that the Principality of Bernhardt could not allow its relations with the Bapharia cult to deteriorate in this chaotic situation.
Unconvinced, Carvein was told by King Norbert, "Someday, history will reveal the truth.
Now that he is a public king, the husband can no longer return to the coin-operated pavilion.
Feste's debt was wiped out by this achievement.
Feste, however, looked somewhat forlorn.
We met up with Charlotte and Jake in Kanaloa.
They both knew the case was closed. Jake praised me for my success.
I returned the pendant to Charlotte, which she had left unborrowed.
She was curious, too, and seemed relieved when I picked it up.
We returned to Asterleeds and parted ways with Jake and the others.
The coin pavilion was left to Jake again. I told him that the owner would not be able to return home for a while.
......Wouldn't it be nice to have a place to go home to?" Feste murmured quietly.
At the same time, a ceremony was held at Bernhardt Castle to honor Carvein's achievements.
It seems that Carvein was personally labored over by Duke King Norbert, and Carvein became known as a hero of salvation.

The events surrounding the Duchy of Bernhardt have been settled, and the conditions of Avaritia Shell and Tyris have stabilized for the time being.
However, it cannot stay this way forever.
We have to figure out a way to rescue Tyris.
The only way to jump back into the past again is to somehow get a chronogram.
Is there a clue anywhere?
Let's talk to our friends first.
Three "Star Spirit Divas" are needed to conduct the Star Spirit Festival.
One will be served by Charlotte.
Let's find the two that remain.
There is only one "Star Spirit Diva" left.
Let's hold the Hoshirei Festival and proceed with the rescue of Tyris.
Preparations began for the largest celebration of the Bapharia religion, the Star Festival.
If there is something you can help with, be willing to lend a hand.
The attack on the Star Festival has been put to rest, but this is not the end of the matter.
The future movements of the armed groups and their backgrounds are also of concern.
The request was set at a high fee that was disproportionate to the content.
As expected, even Feste was suspicious.
Maybe there is some serious secret.
As adventurers, we would not overlook this.
I want you to take down the monsters that are wreaking havoc on our village.
It's a very common request, but it seems a bit urgent.
Apparently, the monster attacks have suddenly become more intense, but .......
Lugerio's worries were endless.
This time, they say, a "fake oracle priestess" has appeared!
As a religious organization, this is a serious situation that cannot be left unattended.
Let's go out and investigate first on his behalf.
The "Singing Class" sponsored by the church, which had been suspended for a while.
Finally, through the enthusiastic efforts of Lalaforte, who serves as the instructor, the program resumed.
The company is now on track to achieve its goal.
Now all that's left is to deliver this good news to the scattered students.
It's just a matter of time.
The Hoshirei Festival ended in a frenzy.
However, Einrain was rarely seen, leading to much speculation.
Is there anything we can do to help those who adore her?
Walken was distracted.
The success of his beloved pupil Millene as a diva has made his passion for archaeology
I think we lost it. ......
Merlouf appears!
I forget how many times this has happened, but he is a godforsaken boy anyway.
This time you're looking for something. ......

Just as they were about to destroy the Chronogate, the armed group that attacked Charlotte in Salamzart appeared.
He manages to fight them off, but is caught off guard by a man who seems to be the leader of the group, and is blown to the center of the Chronogate.
Then the man muttered.
Alicia bless you."
In response to the keywords, the chronogate has executed a chronoleap.
The era we arrived at is far into the future.
It was a future of destruction where all civilization was overrun by the "Beast of the Planet" that awoke. ......
The destruction extends to the "Pillar of Divinity" and violent tremors strike.
At that moment, a woman called out, "Run!" She shouted, "Run away!
There she was, the mysterious hooded woman I had met in Kanaloa.
Aerinse quickly activated the chronogate and somehow managed to escape the situation.
An unidentified armed group. The man at the head of the group who activated the Chronogate. The future of destruction that awaits us. The mysterious woman who helped me escape from there. ......
Attempts to return to the past and rescue Tyris were unsuccessful.
It is inevitable that the destruction of the world will eventually come, as it is now.
As if to indicate a hopeless situation, the high purity chronograms that had reached their limit shattered, and no further chronoleaps could be made.
I feel heavy, but I must return the pendant to Charlotte.
It seems that Lugerio is in charge of all the offerings made at the Star Festival.
There was just a discussion among the priests at the temple in Asterleeds.
Let's go talk to Lugerio to see if we can get an offering.
The medicine was made and Lalaforte was able to speak again.
Her voice rang out beautifully and spontaneously, as one would expect from a "star spirit diva.
Lalaforte, who has regained her natural cheerfulness, already looks motivated for the Hoshinrei Festival.
This is the second "Star Spirit Diva" we have found.
Let's go back to Einlein to report.
When I left the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins," I received a message from Aerinse.
While looking at Tyris, Aerinse herself has apparently started a part-time job at the Coin Pavilion.
It may be a sign of Aerinse's determination to be as independent as possible.
Millene said she is returning to the temple in Asterleeds.
Once the metal plate is delivered, the third diva will be born.
The celebration by the "Star Spirit Singers" began, marking the end of the Star Spirit Festival.
A solemn chant plays and the theater is enveloped in a mystical atmosphere.
-- and the stage took a sharp turn from there!
Amidst glittering music and lights, three divas change into spectacular stage costumes and start singing.
This is how Charlotte and her friends planned to stage the Star Festival.
The audience went wild and the theater was filled with loud cheers.
In the meantime, a group of armed men snuck into the back of the theater to take Charlotte's life.
However, Carvein was there and the armed group was dismissed.
At the same time, there was an attack on the temple in Asterleeds, but Feste's hunch was also right and he was able to wait and repel the attackers.
Thus, the Seirei Festival came to a successful conclusion amid unprecedented excitement.
He returned the pendant to Charlotte.
Charlotte was indeed shocked when I told her that I had lost what was inside.
However, they concealed this from us and took care of us.
It's heartbreaking. ......
The offerings left in the Bapharia cult were only a few fragments, very little to chronoleap.
Moreover, they are canceling this year's Hoshinrei Festival.
Due to the attack by the Duchy of Bernhardt and other factors, it was no longer possible to have the three "Star Spirit Divas," the key elements of the ritual.
Charlotte heard about it and ran for diva.
And the offerings lit up in response to her song.
To my surprise, it seems that Charlotte has the special qualifications needed to be a "Star Spirit Diva".
Once the remaining two are found, the star festival can be held as usual.
It should be possible to make a chronogram.
He drove Lalaforte safely to the "Sanctuary of Blessings".
After the greeting, Lalaforte asked Einrain to share the results of her singing practice.
Einlein sings in a faltering voice a lullaby that Feste had taught her one day.
It was flattering, but not a good singer. ...... Charlotte, who was listening to it, unexpectedly burst into tears.
Somehow, the song was an irresistible nostalgia for Charlotte, she said.
Moreover, even Tyris responded to the singing and shed tears as well.
Feste continued to sing, but received no further response.
Is it due to the song or not?
We don't know for sure, but there seems to be no doubt that Tyris' consciousness is emerging.
He delivered a metal plate to Millene.
There was a song inscribed on it that had been handed down in ancient times, long before the civilization of Bapharia.
Millene reproduced a lullaby that Feste sang in Salamzart and taught Einlein.
The passage included the rest of the story.
Millene is packed, wanting to know the details of the song.
However, even Feste did not know the details of the song, and in fact, did not even seem to know why he remembered it.
I'm sorry for Millene, but I can't tell you what I don't know.
In any case, the three "star-spirit divas" are all here.
This will allow us to open the Star Spirit Festival.
The Star Festival was over, and the city and the temple returned to their usual routine.
For the time being, Lugerio seems to have patted his chest.
However, they didn't expect such a big fuss, which seems to have caused more headaches. ......
Refining has begun on the offerings to God and chronograms.
The "Diva of the Star Spirits" sings in a special room, which I'm told is located in the back of the Asterleeds Temple.
Perhaps those who attacked the temple were aiming there.
However, there is no way that an unrelated person would know of the room's existence.
Who are those armed groups?
The "Sanctuary of Blessings" was in serious trouble.
Tyris is in agony as the condition of the avaritia shell deteriorates rapidly.
The power of Einlein's warding is also out of reach.
As it was about to go out of control, a black Imagine Seed shone and held the avaritia shell in check.
Then the words spilled out of his mouth. "Car ...... ve, in ......?" And.
The next moment, the avaritia shell disappeared without a trace, leaving behind an intense light - and then it was gone.
Just as he is stunned, Merlouf now appears.
Perhaps some special power was used, or perhaps everyone's movements were blocked by Merlouf.
Just when I thought I was about to be swallowed by the mysterious light - the Imagine Seed shined again, repelling Merlouf's power.
Merlouf, alone, seemed convinced and said, "You can look for avaritia shells," and left.
Aerinse's voice calling for Tyris echoed hollowly in the empty void of the Sanctuary of Blessings.

Aerinse made a bold proposal to rescue Tyris.
The idea is to use chronoleap to jump into the past and destroy the Chronogate before Bachelard comes to this time period.
That way Aerinse will not be taken away and Tyris and Avaritia Shell will not merge.
Aerinse will not be able to return to the future, but he is prepared to do so.
If you're going to go that far, I can't leave you alone.
Feste smiled wickedly at Aerinse, who tried to do it all by herself.
What about the chronogram?　We have a plan," he said.
Charlotte's pendant still has the high-purity chronogram on it.
With that, we should all be able to jump back in time.
Charlotte was visited by Carvein.
They were looking at each other's pendants.
A clue to Charlotte's parents and a reward given to Carvein by Duke Norbert.
The two pendants look so much alike that one can only assume they are the same.
However, Carvein received one that was made specifically for him as a credit to the Dunkirk case.
It shouldn't be in Charlotte's hands. ......
While the mystery remains, the priority now is to jump to the past.
He borrowed the pendant and the high-purity chronogram from Charlotte.
Aerinse was a bit sentimental as she looked up at the mihashira.
By destroying the Chronogate, we can save Tyris, but we will never be able to return to this time period and see her again.
Still, Aerinse chose to save Tyris.
The Chronogate is still in operation on the top floor of the Gobashira.
Aerinse's resolve is unwavering.
The "Star Festival," the greatest celebration of the Bapharia religion, is coming up.
According to Aerinse, the true purpose of the Star Festival is to create "offerings to the gods.
The offering is the chronogram, he said.
The Order of Bapharia may have a chronogram in storage to be dedicated to the Bapharia God Tribe.
I immediately tried to visit Einlein, but Carvein and Charlotte said they would go with me.
If they go to the Sanctuary of Blessings, they will know that Tyris and Avaritia Shell are there.
However, Aerinse chose to tell them the truth.
It is better to have a trusted collaborator to protect Einlein and to protect Tyris.
Let's head to the "Sanctuary of Blessings" and tell them the truth.
In the Sanctuary of Blessings, Tyris' condition was deteriorating!
It seems that some time ago, the Avalitia shell showed signs of awakening.
Einrain took care of it immediately, but Tyris remains in pain. ......
Carvein and Charlotte are speechless in front of the avaritia shell.
Aerinse activated a device in the cathedral and began to recount the events of the past.
The Bapharia Gods, the Chrono-Leap, Tyris and Avaritia Shell, the future of perdition - the future of perdition.
Carvein and his colleagues were indeed confused by the story, which was so far from reality.
But in the end, they believed in us and promised to help us.
Aerinse seemed a little relieved to have one of the niggles off her chest.
One of the candidates for "Diva of the Star Spirits" is Lalaforte, a priestess who had served in that role the last time.
She has a throat injury and is recuperating in her hometown.
Lalaforte, who is of "People of the Forest" blood, has his home on the outer continent, beyond the sea. Right now he should be at Cape Rauwehara, the gateway to the continent.
Charlotte and Carvein would accompany him to the outer continent, while Lugerio would search for the third "Star Spirit Diva".
Aerinse remains in the "Sanctuary of Blessings" to keep an eye on Tyris.
First, take a liner to Cape Rauwehara.
When I arrived at Cape Rauwehara, I received a message from Aerinse.
There seems to be no change in Tyris' condition. Aerinse is apparently being taken care of at the temple in Asterleeds.
Aerinse seems to be talking and interacting with the people around her in her own way, but she also seems somewhat dangerous. ......
I'd better find Lalaforte and leave as soon as possible.
Carvein, on the other hand, seemed to be out of his mind.
At Cape Rauwehara he met Hugo, a high civil official of the Principality of Bernhardt.
He said he was here on a work visit, but by all appearances he was picking up women when I saw him. ......
Carvein, too, seems to be having a hard time with Hugo's unrestrained nature.
As I was about to begin my sermon, Hugo ran off to talk to another woman.
Although he is elusive, Hugo says he is brilliant and bright about many situations.
They may know something about Lalaforte as well.
Perhaps because he went around talking to women, women, Hugo knew about Lalaforte.
A woman with the blood of the forest people is said to live in a hermitage outside the village.
Perhaps that would be Lalaforte.
When Hugo heard that Charlotte was going to serve as the "Star Spirit Diva" and conduct the Star Spirit Festival, he left, suddenly motivated.
Let's meet Lalaforte first.
We found Lalaforte and were able to talk to him.
She was not allowed to enter her home township and her throat was not being treated well.
In a muffled voice, he told me the name of a material called "slime moss" that can be found in the "Valley of Coral Rocks.
With this, he said, he would be able to make the medicine that has been passed down in his hometown.
Let's go gather materials on behalf of Lalaforte.
I got the "slime moss" without incident.
It smells and feels amazing, and I don't think it's approximately throat-relieving, but you can find it at .......
Carvein was seriously considering giving it to Einrain as a souvenir if it would help her sing better.
The exchange from there apparently put Charlotte in a bad mood.
Sorry to hear that, but I'll get around to following up later.
First, let's deliver "slime moss" to Lalaforte.
They have already found a third diva candidate.
Lugerio is going to Minsterhorn to see him.
A quick chase ensued, but Charlotte was caught by Lalaforte.
As the "Diva of the Star Spirit," it is necessary to learn about the traditions and customs of the cult.
It seems that Lalaforte's guidance is quite strict, but that's all we can do.
I left the rest to him and decided to visit the third potential diva.
The third diva candidate was Millene, a historian.
She seems to qualify, and the pieces of the chronogram glow in response to her singing.
When I asked her to take on "The Star Spirit Diva," Millene offered me one condition.
They want me to go retrieve the metal plates they found at the "Tower Rock Mine Site."
Lugerio also told me that he would turn a blind eye if it was an unproblematic legacy.
Let's get this over with quickly.
During the Star Festival, Asterleeds attracts many tourists from all over the world, and people come and go.
Some of them may be bad guys mixed in.
This would be a great opportunity for an armed group to target Charlotte.
The Order's guards, the dispatched Knights of Bernhardt, and Carvein are also on guard duty.
It would be a good idea to make the rounds of the city from time to time as well.
I visited the Coin Pavilion amidst the bustle of the Star Spirit Festival.
There, Aerinse, a new waitress, was struggling and had just broken a ...... large plate.
Jake hired me, but I hear it's been a struggle.
Hugo, a high civil official of the Principality of Bernhardt, intervened.
Hugo is also staying in Asterleeds due to the fact that he is receiving support from the Duchy of Bernhardt.
He dismissed Hugo, who was talking lightly, and he and Aerinse returned to the temple once more.
Let's go check on Charlotte and the others.
The success of the Star Spirit Festival rests on the shoulders of the "Star Spirit Diva".
Charlotte, Lalaforte, and Millene were in the temple discussing the stage.
The divas seemed motivated, although some words sounded like they were up to something.
Charlotte is particularly enthusiastic.
I am sure they will give us a great stage.
It is our role to protect these women.
Lugerio is also busy running around for the climax of the Star Festival.
Carvein is said to be in charge of security.
They are at the entrance of the theater, so let's go talk to them once.
He met up with Carvein and reviewed the situation.
The theater where Charlotte and her friends will be performing is fully secured. Carvein will also be in charge here.
However, Feste expressed concern that security might be too concentrated in one place.
While the "Star Spirit Diva" sings, the priests gather in the theater and the temple becomes less crowded.
A shrewd person might take advantage of the opportunity.
Here, we, who can move freely, should fortify the temple's defenses.
Soon the Seirei Festival will reach its climax.
Whoever shows up, never let them get in the way.
Carvein apparently captured one of the militants.
They are conducting the interrogation in the basement of the temple.
We may learn something about who they are and who is behind this.
The man in the armed group died during interrogation.
Poisoning. .......
It does not seem as if he closed his mouth on his own. It is likely that someone was trying to keep him quiet.
There may be more nefarious characters in the dark than we can imagine.
Once there, let's meet up with our friends and sort out the information.
Lalaforte explained the poison used.
This is called "Grizonia grass" and is a deadly poison that can only be found in Cape Rauwehara.
Only locals know about it and it is not distributed. Furthermore, they need to be processed and used while they are fresh.
In other words, it is believed that the armed group's hideout is located near the Cape Rauwehara cluster.
All we need to do is to actually check the site.
Charlotte wanted to accompany me to Cape Rauwehara.
It was Charlotte who was originally targeted for her life. I understand the desire to know the identity of the armed group.
Carvein is also coming with us as an escort.
Somewhere out of sight, it feels like an even deeper darkness is seething. ......
Head to Cape Rauwehara and uncover the identity of the armed group.
When Carvein arrived at the Grisonia grass colony, he looked around.
You must have tilted your head when you saw Cape Rauwehara before.
At that moment, the Imagine Seed that Carvein had given me glowed, and a strange vision flashed in my mind.
--one woman called Adelaide.
In his arms is a newborn baby.
She whispered the baby's name in a calm voice.
Carvein" and--
When I told him this, a voice called out from the shadows.
Standing there was Hugo.
It was also the same figure as that armed group - the man who had chrono-leaped them into a future of destruction in the past "Pillar of Divinity"!
Hugo smiled thinly and disappeared.
There must be some kind of connection with the armed groups.
We must follow them and find out the truth.
Hugo called himself the "Apostle of the Beast.
The "Beast of the Planet" is a fairy tale that once destroyed all civilizations. It was created by the beast and follows it.
His goal is to kill Charlotte.
She is the leader of the "Survival Front," an organization that opposes the "Beast of the Planet" two thousand years in the future of perdition.
Charlotte was born two thousand years in the future.
Her parents were concerned for her safety and let her go back in time as a baby. The chronogram contained in the pendant was used at that time.
In contrast, Hugo also came to the past through chronoleap.
To ensure that Charlotte, the baby, is killed.
But Hugo's attempts were thwarted by future Charlotte's entourage.
That is Adelaide, a female warrior of the divine tribe of Bapharia.
Carvein's mother was also a person from the perished future.
Hugo, while relentlessly targeting Charlotte, also conspired in the Principality of Bernhardt.
In order to eliminate the Bapharia cult, he made York an experiment in pseudo-avaritia, and he made Dunkirk go on a violent rampage.
All for the sake of "The Beast of the Planet" - and all for the sake of the "Beast of the Planet".
Hugo continues to flee, treating his men as pawns.
Hugo fled into a cave with an opening on the Coast.
There is a strong possibility that something is planted at the back of this room.
Let's not relax and follow Hugo.
According to Hugo, the current avaritia shells are prone to run amok, contributing to the hastening of the awakening of the "planetary beast".
That said, if you chronoleap to save Tyris, that also irritates the beast.
They say they are stuck in limbo either way.
But that is no reason to abandon Tyris.
We must settle with Hugo here in order to find new possibilities.
After a fierce battle, he managed to defeat Hugo, who had manifested the true nature of the beast's apostles and transformed into a deformed form.
Hugo, however, continues to struggle.
He fled to an abandoned and forgotten chronogate.
Hugo forcefully activated the chronogate and disappeared into the torrent of engrams.
He left a curse on Charlotte and all humans at .......
Hugo's purpose may be to awaken the planetary beast through the avaritia shell.
If so, there is a good chance that an anomaly will occur in the avaritia shell.
I must return to the Sanctuary of Blessings and check on Tyris!

Avaritia Shell disappeared from the "Sanctuary of Blessings".
It seems that Hugo fed his own existence into the shell, causing it to run amok.
Although the search continues, the whereabouts of Avaritia Shell are still unknown.
Avaritia Shell is in "Koaniani Forest" on the outer continent.
Or maybe we can find a clue to that.
We must get there as soon as possible before the dragon tribe takes it away from us.
To enter "Ulrau Village," one must Accept the ritual called "Baptism of the Forest," which has been handed down to the people of the forest since ancient times.
What in the world is waiting for us?
It seems that Kapakuku intends to approach the Divine Spirit, Avaritia Shell, in the "Graveyard of Spirits" without the Queen's permission.
The surest way now would be to join Kapakuku's plan.
The Divine Spirit, the mysterious Avaritia, and the dragon tribe Elnigues.
The situation is only getting worse, as they have made enemies of Queen Pipimarka.
Is there a breakthrough somewhere?
The mysterious Avaritia is Queen Pipimarka's daughter, Lulumana, and behind her lies a sad past for mother and daughter.
At least let Aerinse's power free Lulmana's soul and bring her peace.
Einlein seems to have a request for Aerinse.
However, he has been unable to say so.
Let me help you.
Since the incident with her daughter, the queen has completely lost her confidence.
Aerinse, who knows the anguish of those at the top, said he wanted to help somehow.
Rumors of the defeat of the dragon tribe in Koaniani Forest had reached Jake's ears.
Such a request from him seems to be related to ...... the dragon tribe, after all.
There have been a number of monster attacks in and around Salamzart.
When Charlotte heard this, she couldn't stay away.
The traveling troupe of performers is said to remain in the area to this day.
Let's go with her to see how things are going.

Please wait for the next update
Defeated Avaritia in "Zelma Mine Ruins."
The informant said that he had been instructed by Hugo to "flee here if pursued by the Principality.
Perhaps he intended to use Avaritia to take out informants connected to him.
We got a clue for the moment.
Let's go back to the castle and report to Duke Norbert, the king.
Kapakuku told me about the situation in "Ulrau Village".
A few years ago, Avaritia settled near the township.
Kapakuku and his group tried to defeat Avaritia, but for some reason the queen stopped them.
The forest has been ravaged by avaritia.
Recently, however, an entity has emerged to follow that avaritia.
It is called the "divine spirit" and is revered by the people of the forest.
If the Divine Spirit is an avaritia shell, it will not be easy to hand it over.
On the other hand, the dragon tribe is also in the dark for avaritia shells.
The situation regarding "Ulrau Village" and the people of the forest is very complicated.
As we were talking at one point, we heard a sound coming from the bushes in the forest.
It looks like someone is approaching the township.
Let's go with Kapakuku and see what's going on.
He had an audience with Pipimarka, Queen of the People of the Forest.
She also seems to remember Adelaide and Carvein visiting the area.
Perhaps this is why, although initially calm, his demeanor changed when he heard the name of the Bapharia cult.
Apparently, he had incurred the wrath of the queen.
They didn't even listen to him about the divine spirit, and he and Kapakuku were kicked out of the pavilion. ......
There was an eccentric nappo in "Hellish Marshland."
The nappo was the original old Kava Ak.
It is true that he has been close to Pipimarka since he was a child, but he is apparently shunned by the foresters because he is quite a bigot.
Kapakuku soothed him by giving him a bottle of "Nappo's Delicious Water," and somehow Kava Ak's mood was restored.
When I told him how Pipimarka was doing, Kava Ak became somewhat mystified.
It seems to ring a bell.
Listen to Kava Ak in The Garden of the Great Sages.
According to the informant, Hugo had its eyes on the "Koaniani Forest" on the outer continent.
Koaniani Forest" is a region ruled by the forest people, and beyond that lies the grounds of the dragon tribe.
Apparently, the goal was to develop closer ties with the dragon tribe.
Considering the future of "dragon tribes getting avaritia shells," "Koaniani Forest" must be significant.
Carvein also offered to go to "Koaniani Forest" separately.
He seems to have some concerns about Avaritia Shell and her mother.
The next destination is "Koaniani Forest.
Let's inform the Bapharia Order and get them in position.
It was Carvein who came to the forest.
Kapakuku is surprised to hear Carvein's name. He had met Carvein's mother, Adelaide.
If what Hugo said is true, then the avaritia shell, or divine spirit, may be Adelaide.
To confirm this, it would be necessary to go to the "Graveyard of Spirits" to see the Divine Spirit in person.
Kapakuku told him that if he cooperated with him, he could take him to see the queen.
He seems to have a purpose.
However, in order to enter "Ulrau Village", one must be "baptized in the forest".
Lalaforte seems to be able to give us more details.
Pipimarka apparently hates the Bapharia cult.
Those associated with the cult are excluded from "Ulrau Village" and this is why Lalaforte was expelled.
Carvein looked quite depressed when he mentioned the cult.
To enter the "Graveyard of Spirits," you need permission from Pipimarka, but if that is difficult, you have to force your way through.
Kapakuku seemed to intend to do so and asked us what we were prepared to do.
Nodding, Kapakuku said with a stern look on his face, "I'll take you to see my people.
At the back of the "Tuonela Approach" appeared Elnigues, an old general of the dragon tribe.
They came to break the non-aggression pact with the forest people and take the Avaritia Shell.
A fight was inevitable. Just as I was preparing myself, Avaritia burst in with a strange cry.
Kapakuku says that the mysterious avaritia of ravaging the forest.
His appearance bore a striking resemblance to the changed York.
Elnigues shook off Avaritia, who grabbed him, and flew off into the sky.
The mysterious avaritia came at them.
After somehow fighting them off, Avaritia fled deep into the forest, dragging her wounded body with her.
I was about to follow when I heard Pipimarka's voice.
There they found Pipimarka's men and Lalaforte, who had been captured by them.
The defeatist faction was crushed and Lalaforte fell into the hands of Pipimarka and his group.
Telling them of Elnigues' presence does not change Pipimarka.
With Lalaforte as a hostage, they could not resist, and all of them were expelled from "Ulrau Village". ......
Kava Ak told me about Pipimarka's past.
Pipimarka once fell in love with a Bapharia priest who came to the forest and had a daughter named Lulmana.
However, Lulmana was taken away by her husband and returned several years ago.
It became a pseudo-avaritia figure - and it was a pseudo-avaritia figure.
The mysterious avaritia that ravages the forest is Lulumana, Pipimarka's daughter.
That is why Pipimarka decided to forbid any attempt to touch Avaritia and to leave the divine spirit that had appeased it untouched.
Pipimarka was desperately trying to protect her daughter.
Kava Ak bowed down to save Pipimarka and Lulumana.
If anyone could do that, it would be Aerinse. Aerinse would be able to free Lulmana's soul.
Aerinse will be picked up by Carvein.
Let's wait for their arrival at Kapakuku's hideout.
He faced Elnigues in "Graveyard of Spirits" and defeated him.
In the back is the Divine Spirit, Avaritia Shell.
But its appearance had been transformed into Tyris itself. The fusion of Tyris and the avaritia shell had progressed, affecting even its appearance.
When Carvein and Aerinse called out, Avaritia Shell responded faintly.
Adelaide and Tyris let out a small voice, their consciousness muddled.
But then, Hugo's shadow was quickly cast - and there it was.
The next moment, the ground shook and burst into pieces.
Elnigues used the last of his strength to break off with Avaritia Shell.
Then a new dragon tribe, Avninte and Ulgarm, appeared and took the Avaritia shell away.
Voldigen's laughter echoes in the void.
The worst possible future has come true: "The Dragon Tribe gets the Avaritia Shell." ......

Attempts were made to communicate with Bachelard, but due to the turbulence of space-time, not enough information was obtained.
However, the future seems certain that "the dragon tribe will get the avaritia shell in the future".
We need to find the avaritia shell before the dragon tribe.
The Bapharia cult has joined the search.
Maybe if we talk to them at the temple, we can get some clues.
The Order did not seem to have any new information on avaritia shells.
Meanwhile, the Principality of Bernhardt is tracking developments regarding the dragon tribe.
However, it seems that the communication is days late.
I guess I'd better go see what's going on instead of waiting.
Carvein is in charge of research regarding the dragon tribe.
According to Duke King Norbert, Carvein seems to have grasped the connection between Hugo and the dragon tribe Leanbluhm.
They are in pursuit of an informant who can provide evidence of this, but he has not returned past his scheduled appointment.
There may still be Hugo's men in the duchy, and Norbert is not able to devote his manpower to the task in an open manner.
We should help Carvein here, as we are free to move around.
Carvein was at the "Zelma Mine Site".
They have already caught the informant, but he has something on his mind.
That's when Omnistron responded.
Deep in the "Zelma Mine Ruins" was Avaritia, and Carvein was trying to stop this from getting out.
With the advent of avaritia shells, this avaritia may also be becoming more ferocious.
We can't just leave it there.
Koaniani Forest" is the land where the forest people live.
They avoid interaction with the outside world and will not listen to you if you visit them unexpectedly.
There, Lalaforte, who is of the blood of the people of the forest, was to guide us.
Let's meet up with Lalaforte in Jubilia first.
According to the people of Jubilia, a dragon tribe was seen in the direction of the "Koaniani Forest".
Trade with the forest people seems to be less frequent these days.
There is a different atmosphere at .......
Let's hurry to "Koaniani Forest".
I arrived at "Koaniani Forest."
Using the omnistron, there was a strong engram response further into the forest.
It may be indicative of an avaritia shell.
The place is the "Graveyard of Spirits". It is inaccessible without the permission of the queen of the forest people.
The queen is in "Ulrau Village," the township of the forest people.
Let's head to "Ulrau Village.
Lalaforte has a disturbing feeling about this.
Let us remain vigilant.
They fought off an attack by dragon tribesmen who flew in from the sky above.
It was true that the dragon tribe had invaded the Koaniani Forest.
After the battle, a figure emerged from the forest.
Kapakuku, the warrior of the forest people.
He is a childhood friend of Lalaforte and is said to be the gatekeeper of "Ulrau Village".
When I told him that there might be dangerous avaritia in the "Graveyard of Spirits," Kapakuku told me to move the place to his hideout, saying that he did not want others to hear about it.
I think I have an idea what it is.
To meet the queen in "Ulrau Village," one must go through Kapakuku.
Let's hear what he has to say.
Lalaforte told me about "The Baptism of the Forest".
To obtain "Star Flowers" in the "Flower Tour Tree Cluster."
This is the 'baptism of the forest' and is a sign of recognition by the forest.
However, it is said that there is a guardian near the "star flower" to protect it. Be on your guard.
Head to the "Flower Tour Tree Cluster" and look for "Star Flowers."
I got "Star Blossom" without incident.
Lalaforte says it's not a problem.
Let's tell Kapakuku and let him enter "Ulrau Village".
Kapakuku was also recognized as having completed his "baptism in the forest".
This will allow you to enter "Ulrau Village".
It seems that Kapakuku will lead us to the queen.
However, Lalaforte was expelled from "Ulrau Village" for his belief in the Bapharia religion and cannot enter.
Head to the Queen's mansion and ask for permission to enter the "Graveyard of Spirits".
Kapakuku and his like-minded friends in "Kazemi no Takadai."
Let's head for "Kazemi's High Place".
Kapakuku was joined by a group of "defeatists" who wanted to restore peace by defeating the avaritia and the divine spirits in the forest.
They were frustrated because Queen Pipimarka forbade them from meddling in Avaritia.
It seems that the plan was to defeat the Divine Spirit while it was quelling avaritia.
Kapakuku said that he would sneak into the "Graveyard of Spirits" while his friends were causing a commotion.
Accompany Kapakuku to the "Graveyard of Spirits".
The defeatists attracted the attention of the soldiers.
Use this opportunity to break through the "Tuonela Path" that leads to the "Graveyard of Spirits".
A lot of things are happening and it's confusing.
Let's head to Kapakuku's hideout for a moment and get the situation straightened out.
When I arrived at the hideout, Lalaforte, who had been released, came to me.
Pipimarka had no intention of hurting Lalaforte, apparently. She wants to protect her subjects as a queen.
However, he does not allow them to meddle with the Divine Spirit or the mysterious Avaritia.
It is not clear where Pipimarka's true intentions lie.
Kapakuku told me that Kava Ak, the original old man who lives in the forest, has long been friends with Pipimarka.
He seems to be a man of habit, but he is a good person to know what Pipimarka thinks.
Visit Kava Ak in Hellish Marshland.
While waiting for Aerinse's arrival, the forest suddenly became noisy.
The dragon tribe launched a full-scale invasion to seize Avalitia Shell.
If Voldigen shows up, he might eat Lulmana, which has become avaritia.
Of course, you can't give them an avaritia shell.
Let's head as soon as possible to the "Tuonela Approach" and then to the "Graveyard of Spirits" at the end of it.
In front of the entrance to the "Graveyard of Spirits," Lulmana and Elnigues were fighting.
Pipimarka sees Lulumana, who is hurt, and raises a grief-stricken voice. But it does not reach Lulumana.
Kapakuku defends Pipimarka, who was almost caught in the fight.
Realizing that all the circumstances were known, Pipimarka laughed to himself, but Kapakuku interrupted him.
No one can blame her for being a mother before the King."
Elnigues strikes down Lulmana and disappears into the "Graveyard of Spirits" with Avaritia Shell.
Then Carvein rushed in with Aerinse.
We leave Lulmana and Pipimarka in charge and go after Elnigues. We cannot give the avaritia shell to the dragon tribe.
When Aerinse heard what happened, he performed a release ceremony for Lulmana.
Lulumana's soul is released and she says goodbye to Pipimarka.
The forest echoed with the lamentations of one mother--

Hi. How's your adventure going?　How's the adventure going?
My name is Warren. My partner is Carnella.
I work for the King Collector, a collector!
We are now collecting "pieces of ancient mural paintings" under my master's orders.
You can give me a hand too, if you like.
Accept our request and get more "Ancient Mural Pieces"!　Best regards, haha!
Hahaha!　Warren, the King Collector's messenger!
Have you gathered the "Pieces of Ancient Murals"?
Actually, I just found a big chunk of piece, but there was a monster nearby. But there was a monster nearby.
My body, which is so much about beauty, can't even touch them!
What do you think?　Would you be willing to collect the "Piece of Ancient Mural" for me?
Oh, no!　A powerful rival has emerged for the collection of "Pieces of Ancient Murals!
The goblins from <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>are restoring murals just like us!
Some of them are robbing pieces for it.
We can't just leave them there!　Defeat them and get back the "Piece of Ancient Mural" that was stolen from us!
Speaking of festivals, sweets!　Are you interested in some nice sweets?
We're collecting a lot of sweets right now.
I could use some help from you as well.
I'm sure things will be good. Hahaha!
How's the "Fake Sweets" collection coming along?
Actually, I heard that a gluttonous monster has eaten a lot of "fake sweets.
I can't help it, they look delicious, but I don't want them to be eaten up!
Could you please defeat the monsters and collect the "fake sweets" that were eaten as well?　Thanks in advance!
I got a call that the peddlers were going to deliver "Fake Sweets" to me, but I'm in a bit of a bind.
Apparently, the monster took it away from me on the way.
The monster with the sweet tooth literally smells it.
We want our 'fake suites' back and we can't leave the monsters alone!
Can you help me?　Please!
Hey there!　Are you enjoying your summer in Asterleeds?
Suddenly, you have a swimsuit?
If you don't have one, why don't you accept a simple request?
Rent a nice swimsuit as a reward!
Summer means swimsuits!　Don't you miss this wave too!　Hahaha!
When you think of summer, what do you imagine?　The ocean?　The sun?　Or physical beauty?
All are correct, of course, but there is one thing that I just can't leave out!
It is a one-summer avant-garde!
A hot gaze beckons, a blazing summer fantasy. ......
But then there are those who take away your summer gaze.
Adventurers, can you protect our summer?
Thanks to your defeat of the shell goblin, I had the summer's attention all to myself!　It was supposed to be .......
Not yet. ...... summer shouldn't be like this yet!
The sparkle of a swimsuit!　The hot gazes that are turned on you!　Oh, summer, don't go away!
Don't let the shell goblins steal your summer!
Come on, let's take down more and more!　Summer's eyes are glued to you!
My husband is looking for something fluffy and soft right now.
I think "Cottonmouth Crystal" has hit the spot, and I'm just scratching and clawing my way through it.
If you want, you can help me too.
I have a lot to thank you for!　Hahaha!
I can't get over how fluffy "Cottonwood Crystal" is.
So, there it is!　I'm going to follow my husband's lead and try my hand at some original fashions using "cotton wool crystals!
I wonder if you could help me while I collect the "cotton wool crystals"?
The "King Collector" is now in the final stages of making his "Cotton Wool Crystal" cushions.
We need the ultimate fabric to wrap the finest fluff!
We have no choice but to ask for the help of adventurers here.
Help me make my husband's fluffy dreams come true!　Please, haha!
We are now collecting "Whitecap Balls" on my master's orders.
These beads drifted from faraway foreign lands and were once used to form romantic picture scrolls.
Adventurers, why don't you get your hands on a "Whitecap Jade" and experience the romance of an ancient foreign land?
The "Whitecap Balls" are gathering one after another.
This is all thanks to the help of adventurers and everyone else!
However, it seems that goblins have been stealing the "Whitecap Balls" from us without any kind of punishment.
Can you collect what they have accumulated?
How about collecting "Whitecap Balls"?
I want them to collect without hesitation, but the goblins are at it again!
It seems that they haven't given up on the "Whitecap Jade. At last, they are about to harm travelers and peddlers.
This cannot be left alone!
I need your help, Mr. Adventurer!
We are now collecting "petals of blue fragrance" under the order of our master.
It is a wonderful gift to congratulate the happy bride and groom and to make us happy as well!
Of course, adventurers will also be happy to exchange their money for gorgeous prizes!
Can you help me collect "Ao Kaoru no Hanaberu"?　Hahaha!
The "petals of Ao Kaoru" are coming together nicely.
However, it seems the goblins haven't given up on using them for flower divination!
Now the Elder Goblins are taking the lead and trying to take "Ao Kaoru no Hanaberu" with them!
Happy wedding season!　We cannot let our blessings be taken away from us!
I need your help in defeating the Elder Goblins!
The collection of "Ao Kaoru no Hanaben" is in a pinch!
This time, it seems that Mook and his group are planning some kind of big ritual using the "Ao Kaoru no Hanaberu"!
It's as if he gathers up "petals of blue fragrance" from all over the place and uses them all at once.
We cannot afford to overlook this!
Adventurer!　Stop Mook's ritual and protect "Petals of Blue Kaoru"!
We are now collecting "King Collector Coins" under my master's orders.
The "King Collector" made these coins on his own, but they have been stolen!
They want us to punish those who stole them and help them recover the "King Collector Coins"!
I've been looking for someone who might have "King Collector Coins" and I've found some promising information.
Oh my God, it's the Highland Fox!
The coins are shiny, so it looks like they got caught up in it and picked them up.
If you eat it, you're in trouble!
I need your help to collect the "King Collector Coins"!
The "King Collector Coin" has been found in another weird place!
Arena in Asterleeds!
What a surprise, it seems there are "King Collector Coins" mixed in with the Arena winnings!
I think most people would be offended if they were handed this!
Can you clear the Arena and sneak it back to me?
We are now collecting "spilled star sand" on my master's orders.
I'm talking about the fantastic shards that fall from the sky at this time of year!
Isn't it romantic to make a wish on star-shaped sand?
I need your help to collect "Spilling Star Sand"!
Nice to meet you, haha!
Is "Spilling Star Sand" gathered?
The kids are collecting them too, making wishes, but they've heard bad things about them!
I've been told that the bandits have stolen the "spilled star sand" that I had collected.
We can't afford to overlook this one!
I want you to get the "Spilled Star Sand" back from the unscrupulous people!
How's the "Spilled Star Sand" collection going?
People are having fun, but there are some troubling rumors going around.
The "spilt star sand" is more likely to make your wish come true.
It seems that some young people have taken this to heart and are trying to go to the "Soundless Foothills.
Why don't you take down the monsters and show them that that place is dangerous?
We are now collecting "Merry Red for the Holy Night" on my master's orders.
They brightly decorate the young trees and make everyone's wishes on the holy night!
A wonderful gift in exchange for a great prize awaits the adventurers, too!
Could you please collect the "Holy Night Merry Red"!　Hahaha!
How's the "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night" collection going?
We prepared young trees for decoration.
However, 'snow-covered boas' have been showing up all over the place. They are eating the buds of our precious young trees!
They are going to grow up together with their children!
Adventurers, can you take down the "snow-covered boa"?
Please help me protect this wonderful festival!　Hahaha!
The "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night" is coming together more and more!
Thanks to the adventurers, the holy night will be a big success!
However, did the festive atmosphere get to the "snow-covered boa"?
I just feel like there are more and more of them!
It seems some of them have swallowed the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" and I want you adventurers to get rid of them!
We are now collecting "spring welcoming flowers" on my master's orders.
It is a good omen to celebrate the new year in a distant foreign land!
Collect as many as you can and share the festive spirit with everyone!
I've got some great prizes to thank you for your help!　Hahaha!
Thank you for collecting "Spring Welcoming Flowers."
We were getting together just fine, but then an unexpected competitor appeared!
It's like the skyfish have been attracted by the beauty of "Spring Welcoming Flowers" and have been eating them from one end to the other!
I don't want to be disturbed from collecting "Spring Welcoming Flowers"!
I would like to ask for your help in defeating Skyfish!
The "Spring Welcoming Flowers" are beautifully gathered together, and I congratulate you on this beautiful event!
Is such congratulations attracting the hearts of monsters, too?
The Horngoats are decorating their bunks with "Spring Welcoming Flowers."
I'd like to say it's quaint and beautiful, but it seems to be taking away the "spring welcoming flowers" from where people are.
This is not right!　It is not beautiful!
Help us defeat the Horngoats!　Hahaha!
We are now collecting "fairy nectar" under the orders of our master.
It's very sweet and sparkling nectar.
I'd like to serve sweets made with it to everyone in town!
I wonder if any adventurers would like to lend a hand?
If you collect the "Fairy Lentil Nectar," we'll exchange it for a great prize!
The sweets made with "Fairy Lentil Nectar" have been well received!
However, "King Collector" said, "I want to add a twist that will make it one-of-a-kind! I want to make it one-of-a-kind!
So I'm going to add some playful shades!
Could you help me gather materials?
Thank you for collecting "fairy lotus nectar."
The baking got so exciting that everyone in town decided to join in!
However, it seems that the farm that provides the materials is in trouble because it has been ravaged by monsters.
We can't just leave it at that!
We need your help, adventurers, to help the people on the plantation!
We are now collecting "old Maigurat papers" under my master's order.
I thought I'd use it for a little treasure hunt to coincide with the Asterleeds' opening celebration!
We need your help, adventurers, to keep everyone entertained!
Thanks to you, the collection of "Maigurat waste paper" is going well.
There's just one problem.
A monster has emerged that loves to eat old Maigurat paper!
And with their voracious appetites, it's not going to be easy!
We need to do something before they eat up all the "Maigrat's Old Paper"!
I need your help, Mr. Adventurer, haha!
I was looking for some scattered "old Maigrat papers".
I found it in the most unexpected place. It's a prize from the Arena!
Asterleeds was crowded during the opening ceremony of the port!　Maybe that's why my luggage got mixed up.
I'd like to collect it, but I need to try Arena for that!
Can we ask for your help in anticipation of your adventurous skills?
We are now collecting "gold dust sap" on my master's orders.
Insect collecting was booming among children.
There's an amazing bug called 'King of the Golden Helmet,' and my husband hears about it and wants it!
Gold Powder Sap is a stepping stone!　What do you think?　Wouldn't you like to follow the romance of boys with us, adventurers?
Is the "gold dust sap" being collected?
I'm thinking of expanding my collecting area soon, but I think the rumblebores have developed a taste for "gold dust sap".
When you try to collect them, they come close.
I want to get rid of them while I still can!
Adventurers, can you help us?
How is the "gold dust sap" collection coming along?
Thanks to the adventurers and everyone else, we've gathered a lot.
It may not be a dream to catch the "King of Golden Helmets"!
But it looks like we've got another obstacle in our way!
Miin from "Ritze Tradeway" intercepts and eats the "gold dust sap" that I had just set up!
Adventurers, will you punish those who usurp everyone's dreams?
Asterleeds' major event, the "Opening Port Festival!
Feste seems to be enjoying himself.

I am the class master.
Young adventurer, let me lend you my strength.
If you want to reach the heights, don't settle for one class.
They study multiple classes and look at themselves with a broad knowledge base.
To help you do that, I will prepare a "class change" path for you.
First, gain a better understanding of the class and use it as a stepping stone.
The encounters that await you there will surely lead you to new horizons.
I am Riza, the director of the orphanage.
Like everywhere else, we're short on staff. We can't replenish the supplies we lack.

I'll even pay you a gratuity.

This is a request from the Pioneer Bureau.
I have a letter from Lindsay, a substitute writer, at .......
The handwriting is completely different and it is hard to believe that it was written by Ms. Lindsay.
It is difficult to decipher the badly disordered letters, but the address is probably "Saul".
Could you please deliver the letter and see what is going on?
I'm Melis and I live in Minsterhorn. I don't care what my name is!
Only you can save this village from crisis!　Please, help us!
My cousin Katya made a soup with a Paralysis poison in it without knowing it.

I'm about to go to <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>to take down a pioneer station request, and I was wondering if you'd like to help me out too.

This is Baumann, the mine owner. Can you do me one favor?
I have a delivery for a doctor named Volker in Larpal. I need you to collect and deliver a stone called "Shadow Algae Stone".
It's a rare fossil from around here. Usually we are the ones digging for them, but there are monsters nearby.
I'll give you a sample and you can pick it up on your own. Sorry.
It is a strange coincidence that we even share such a place together.
If you would be so kind, would you do me a favor?
Someone asked me to get rid of some stuff, but it was a little out of my hands. ......
This is a request from a child who is a stranger to me, but I would be happy to oblige.

I'm a smoker's paulette. Is it smoky?　I hope you'll forgive me.
I heard that there's a kiln in Bapharia's heritage that can smoke anything in an instant.
I'm asking you to restore it and I'd like you to pick it up.
I can't wait to try it out. Thank you in advance.
I'm Hubby, a fisherman. I'm always fishing for musclefish in the river, but lately I haven't been able to catch any.

I wonder if something happened downstream.　I need you to go check it out.

I'm Lucas, a fledgling adventurer.
Thanks for carrying our stuff for us the other day. My partner Klaus' whims got us into trouble.
So, I need another favor, can you help me out?
Klaus now says he's going to "go out and kill monsters" and won't listen to me. It's definitely not something we're good enough to do. ......
Please. Stop Klaus together!
My name is Lector, an adventurer and scholar.
We were on our way to Asterleeds with an important cargo when we got stuck in a storm. We were stranded.
I see you are an adventurer with a lot of backbone. This package must be delivered for the future of the people.
Please, can you help us?
Hello~. My name is Tini, and I'm a maid.
The cat has escaped from the mansion and we are searching for it. Oh, I'm so tired!
And, what's more, the cat-sama is injured, but she just goes away.
Don't you think it's tiring?
I can't just leave it there. I'll do what I have to do, so can you help me find the cat?
No really, I'm so tired!
Hello, my name is Cyril. My name is Cyril and I'm a guard of the Bapharia faith.
I have a little request for adventurers. I need you to find some ingredients that are hard to find. ......
Sorry, I can't tell you any more here. I can't tell you any more here. ......
I would like you to come to the garrison of the Bapharia Order in the "Andra Basin" first so that we can discuss the details.
Best regards!
Millene. I have asked that this request be posted if Dr. Walken has not returned after 5 days.
If you're an adventurer and you're reading this, that means you're reading ....... Totally and utterly.
They're busy excavating somewhere in Asteria Plain anyway, so can you give them a little help?　It's probably time to run out of preserves.
I'm sure he'll be saying, "I'm not going home until the excavation is finished! I'm sure he'll be very stubborn about it. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Oh, my. Your clothes are beautifully designed.
Okay, I'll ask you to do it!　I think I'll ask for you. I've been looking for an adventurer with a sense of style.
My name is Thierry. I'm an up-and-coming designer.
I'm thinking of starting up my own brand.
I'm a little short-handed though.
I need materials for my new fashions.
You can go and collect them if you want.　No?
That is Ryuk. One who aspires to the path of the warrior.
I ask this because of your skill. I need to gather some materials for a "proof" that will reveal my firm determination.
Originally it should be done by one person. But, alas, time is running out. I may not be able to do it alone in time.
Please, we need your help!　This is right on the money!
I am Feodor, a scholar who studies weather. My goal is to achieve accurate weather forecasting.
I would like to collect observation records in Asteria Plain. We are looking for collaborators who can visit the places where the monsters appear.
The recording itself will be quick. Can you help us?
My name is Bart. I am an apprentice cook training at Asterleeds.
The other day, the head chef gave me an assignment, and I didn't think I could complete the dish on my own.
Adventurers, please.
Would you like to complete the dish with me?
I'm Radim. I'm on a pilgrimage with my dad and mom to a holy place in Bapharia.
But it seems that " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>" appeared on the street. It's closed to traffic.
I don't mind pilgrimages, though! If you are stranded for days at a time, you can't wait to get away!
Adventurers, can you help me get rid of " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>"?
I'm Ciri, apprentice restorer of Bapharia's heritage.
If you're an adventurer, you're crafting, right?　The "rolling ball kneading ritual," a legacy of Bapharia, used for that is amazing, isn't it?
They're big, imposing, and look very sturdy.
But the inside is a combination of delicate parts, and it's extremely complicated. It needs to be inspected regularly, but we don't have enough stuff to do the work.
Could you go and collect a few things?
My name is Remigio. I'm a future great merchant!
I don't think there's any harm in doing you a favor. I think, so I wonder if you could go to ...... with me to apologize.
Actually, there is someone I need to apologize to. I just can't find the courage to do it alone. ......
Please, follow me along!
I'll apologize to you, too!　So apologize with me!
Hey, I'm Durga, the adventurer.
I was collecting "Sand Viper Triangle Scales" for the Pioneer Bureau. I was collecting "Sand Viper Triangle Scales" for the Pioneer Bureau, but Land Hawk took my weapon on the way.
I couldn't continue with the request if I was unarmed.
I'm sorry, but could you collect the "Sand Viper's Triangle Scale" for me?
Help!
I am Carrion, a new guard. Accepted an order from the captain to defeat a monster. ......
I can't do it!　What do you expect from a newbie like me?
But everyone had to defeat a set number of them to be allowed to do so. ......
I have no other choice but to ask the adventurers for help!　Please!
I am Panayote. I'm a lowly priest of the Bapharia faith.
I've been picking up trash along the streets and around the area while I've been sent out to do chores here and there.
I'm planning to clean between Salamzart and the "Hermit's Fountain" today.
But lately, monsters have been appearing outside of town more and more often.　We need help from adventurers who can fight.
I'd like you to help me pick up trash along with the guards. I'm looking forward to working with you!
I'm a little screwed up.
I made a mistake ordering the wrong food and got the one from Montenol.
The flavor of the food is not the same if it is not from Evergreen.
Anta, can you go get it for me?
Yo. I'm Rike, the concoction master. Hee-hee.
Are you getting used to the way I laugh?　That's fine, baboon baboon .......
I'm mixing up a makeover potion, but I'm in need of another strange ingredient.
This time it's part of the monster. This one is not easy to get.
But if we ask the Pioneer Bureau or other adventurers, they will find out about the existence of the medicine.
Then we would have to ask ...... Anta, wouldn't we?
Hee-hee-hee. I've gone along so far.
Don't be evil now, huh?　Baboon baboon baboon baboon .......
Blundell, the weaponsmith.
I'm trying the old manufacturing method, but apparently the weapons are not strong enough.
I did some research and found out that they use materials from monsters as well as ore.
Then I wouldn't know where to get it from.
You are the only adventurer I know.
Help us again.
I'm Rasha, the lady of the Litze Mining Union. My husband is the mine manager. I take care of the artisans and keep the books.
There's a lot of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>living around our mine.
They're dangerous if left unchecked, so we have to take down a certain number of them on a regular basis.
If you'd like, you could ask me to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>.
Hey, adventurers!　How about a little profit?
My name is Garb. I'm a merchant looking for local specialties and products.
There's a story about that in Litze. There is a fish called "streaky fish" that is a good luck charm. Do you know it?
I saw a school of striped bass in the river the other day.
We'll make a killing if we catch this guy and sell him!　How's that sound?　How about a little help?
Hi, I'm Trace. I'm about to embark on a journey.
I'm trying to collect beautiful landscapes from all over the world with this "Imagine that Leaves a Scenery".
There are people who really want to show you the scenery of different places.
I'm going to look around the Litze area first.
Nevertheless, travel is always dangerous.
I was wondering if I could ask you to escort me for a little while. What do you think?
Hahaha!　I am Guido. I'm a genius detective who shows up where there is a mystery and always gets to the bottom of it!
But this time, even with my clear mind, I can say that it is a difficult case.
A "series of camel thefts" in the vicinity of Salamzart!　The culprits are not seen, only the camels disappear like a mirage. ......
What do you think?　Let's work together to solve the mystery of this case!
My name is Ardlung, owner of a jewelry store.
We were transporting a shipment of jewelry when our wagon was attacked by a horde of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>and our cargo was taken away.
If this continues, I will be out of business.
Please, can you help us get our goods back?
I'm Jin, a hunter in Salamzart. You took care of me sometime ago.
My son was going to perform a ceremony to become a hunter, but a problem arose. <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>There was a huge outbreak of
I can't help my son, but if left unchecked, harm may come to those who are not involved.
Can you help us to reduce the number quickly?
I'm Remigio. I'm a future great merchant!　There's no harm in ingratiating yourself with me!
The other day, a friend of mine at school bragged to me about a treasure he had, a "Testament of Courage."
I've had my dad show me all kinds of treasures, but I've never seen anything that beautiful. ......
I definitely wanted to get that one!
It seems that to find the "proof of courage," one needs the help of an adventurer.
Will you join me in looking for the "proof of courage"?　You'll be rewarded!
Hey. You're an adventurer, right?　I'm Suzette. I'm a mercenary.
The other day I received an unusual lamp as a reward for my work, but I didn't know how to use it. I asked a friend of mine, a scholar named Ferena, to help me figure it out.
But I had no idea what he was talking about, and when I told him that he was being a little difficult, he got mad at me.
I'm sorry, but I need you to go talk to him again.
Hello again. I am Walken, a priest of the third degree.
As a matter of fact, it is said that a mysterious coin glowing in rainbow colors can be found in the ruins of Bapharia near here. If it were true, I would like to go and pick it up myself, but that thing has been nagging at me lately.
The next time we send out a search request, we will deduct the reward from your research fund," he said.
So, could you please find the coins for me?
My name is Kurt!　I'm the son of a grocer.
I know a dairy farmer, Mr. Reuben, who has a legacy in Bapharia. I'm definitely going to help him with his business, so I'd like to get him to give it to me somehow!
But, you know, it's better for an adult to ask for that kind of thing than a kid like me, right?　Why don't you go talk to him instead?
For the sake of our grocery store, you know. Please!
Hi, I'm Paolo, a traveling puppeteer.
I'm touring around different cities, showing puppet shows to children.
I was performing in the square today. I was performing in the square today, and in the middle of it, my precious Ellie disappeared.
Ellie is a doll in the shape of a cat. She is my pride and joy, and my dearest friend.
Please. Can you help me find Ellie?
Hi, I'm Einar, an actor.
I'm working on a role for my next play. But I can't quite grasp the image of the role.
I was looking for someone to play opposite him and I saw the perfect person!
I don't know where he is from, but he is the only one for me.
Can you find out somehow?
Hello, I am Terua.
I got a letter from my uncle Bros. today. He has a problem and wants someone to come over.
However, it's not a place I can go to lightly either.
I know he's a stubborn and eccentric uncle, but could you help him out a bit? I'd appreciate it.
I am Manfredo. I am Manfredo, a well-known wealthy man in this city.
I'm in the middle of remodeling my house.
I need you to pick up a headboard I ordered from Mr. Aurelie, an acclaimed sculptor in Asterleeds.
The due date has already passed, but I guess that's the thing peculiar to artists.
I won't get mad at you for that. Ha-ha-ha!
If the headboard is finished, please deliver it to Eagle.
If you haven't already, go ask for a new due date.
My name is Cattleya. I'm looking for a good business partner.
I wonder if you've ever heard of "Cartoum's Tuskwork".
It is a craft that was made when the ancient desert city of Khartoum was prosperous.
With the decline of the city, the technology has been lost, but .......
I would like to revive this 'cartoum tusk work'.
It's always going to be good business. I have a hunch.
How's that?　I wonder if you could help me.
My name is Laure, a Bapharia priest.
There have been reports of dangerous monsters in the Evergreen Desert at " <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>".
Actually, I asked the adventurers to investigate ahead of time, but they didn't come back and I was worried about them. ......
Please could you go and check on them?
Hello, adventurer.
I would like to ask you to take care of one job for me.
I need you to collect and deliver hunting equipment to a young hunter.
When I was younger, I could collect them myself, but I'm all grandma now.
It's getting harder, indeed.
But if you're an adventurer, it shouldn't be that difficult a job.
I am Berger of the Pioneering Bureau. I only send out this request to prospective adventurers.
Have you ever heard of a team of adventurers called Dragon Crow?　They are the legendary adventurers who were the first to break through the Dragon Claw Valley.
The route they used is now a gateway to success for advanced adventurers. It is a tough and difficult path, but if you complete it, you will be recognized as a first-rate adventurer. Why don't you give it a try?

Hi, my name is Surho. I work in a rose garden.
Actually, I received a mysterious plant from a client. It was supposed to be a magnificent flower, but no matter how long I waited, it never bloomed.
I've tried a lot of things too. ......
I want to make it bloom somehow, so can you help me?
My name is Monica.
The other day I saw something that really caught my attention. I saw my childhood friend, Sulho-kun, giving a bouquet of roses to his gay sister!
What kind of relationship do you two have?
I'm curious but don't have the courage to ask myself: .......
Please go check on that sister!　Please!
I am Isaac, a miner.
I'm training under my master, Mr. Baumann. I lost something very important in the cave. ......
I have to report this to my master, but I'm so scared that my legs are shaking. Please tell the master what's going on for me!
Oh, it's Baumann who runs the mine.
I've been making memorandums about the veins around here for a long time. Before I knew it, a vein I didn't know existed had been written down.
I can't believe that there is a vein of ore that I don't even know exists in the Great Litze Cave.
I'm not sure, but I don't have enough hands to be sure.
Can you go check to see if the vein is real?
You have a nice face!　I can feel your star power.
I'm Barni. I am the world's first adventurer producer.
What do you think?　Would you like to develop your talent as an adventurer with my production?
You will be a top star, you will have status, honor, money, everything.
Come on, take your first step toward glory with me!
My name is Rasha. I'm a caretaker for the miners who work in the mine.
We have a young miner named Akka. Lately, he hasn't been getting any work done at all.
I know you and your girlfriend are going through a difficult time in your personal life.
See, isn't it troublesome for the boss to meddle in these things?　To be honest, I'm interested. But you know what?
I don't want things to get complicated, so I'd like you to explore instead. Please.
Oh, I'm Dr. Volker.
I hear there are some strange drugs floating around these days, do you know about them?
Avaritia Prophylaxis, ......, with a very disturbing name.
I've been asked by the Bapharia Order to help out. I can't do it on my own.
I need to check it out thoroughly. Can you help me?
I am Uro, a woodworker. I make wooden souvenirs.
We get very good lumber around here.
But this is not something you can just cut in the woods. It's an ancient relic.
That's why it's so hard for someone like me, who doesn't know how to fight, to get it.
They are about to run out, and I need you to find them for me.
I'm Garb. I'm a street vendor.
I'm planning to start a business in Salamzart, and there's a guy who might be a nuisance.
No, no, no, it's not a business rivalry. In fact, travelers are being attacked on the road between Salamzart and Litze.
If we leave them alone, we will lose business.
The others are annoyed, too, and can you do something about it?
I, Pissary. I am an adventurer like you.
I came here with a request. ...... Actually, you know what?
I got lost on .......
Please take me to a place called "Dragon Claw Valley.
Please!
My name is Mino. I am the strongest and the loneliest hero!
You think he should have been a Soldier?　Well, I've put that past behind me. I am now the strongest and lone hero!
I will fight again to surpass you!　Because I am the strongest and lone hero!
Hoo ....... Hi, I'm Aaron, an adventurer.
I am looking for a flower called "Kouka" that blooms around here. It is an extremely rare desert flower that is only told about in legends.
As an adventurer, doesn't that pique your curiosity?
Hoo ....... I want to get this flower.
Can you help me?
My name is Quan, a medicine man.
Do you know Tsurka, the adventurer?　I used to be in her care a long time ago.
That's what worries me, because he seems to be getting sick lately.
I need you to deliver the medicine to Tsurka.
My name is Bale. I've lived in Salamzart for generations.
I found something that looked like Bapharia heritage in the attic of the barn. According to the note, it was borrowed from someone by his dead father.
Even though they were made a long time ago, they cannot be left as borrowed.
I would like to return it to its owner, but I wonder if you could help me.
I am Sabrina.
I am a woman who loves singing, theater, fiction ...... and all the arts.
The man I admire most today is Einar, a man of exceptional talent among young actors. He is Einar, a man of exceptional talent among young actors.
What I'm asking of you is what any lover of representation would ask of you.
Go to ...... and get it signed!　Please!
My father is a traveling painter.
That's why I'm not home all the time.
This time, he went to Litze, leaving only a note saying, "I'm going to paint mountains.
It's boring without dad!
Find your father and tell him to come home already!
I'm Emilee. I'm an aspiring actress!
But I just couldn't get my parents to let me. I tried to convince them over and over and over again!
Then Father told me that he was going to give me an assignment.
If we pull this off, it means we'll be recognized, right?
Please!　Can you help me?
I am Sisto. I'm from the Pioneer Bureau.
We have recently observed the phenomenon of cemeteries being razed by someone in various parts of Asteria Plain.
I instructed my subordinate, Cecil, to investigate this matter, but ...... there is a cloud over it.
The normally calm Cecil seemed strangely distraught.
I'm sorry, but I need your help with her.
Excuse me, my name is Paula, a cafe waitress.
Our valued customer, Catherine, has forgotten her handkerchief.
It should be delivered immediately by me or another clerk at .......
Unfortunately, we are all busy and no one is available to help.
Please deliver the forgotten handkerchief to Ms. Catherine.
I am Baphit. I am a calligrapher who has been trying to spread the way of calligraphy.
All I ask is that you take care of my granddaughter, Lindsay.
She says she's going to take over for me. ...... I thought maybe he was saying that out of concern for me.
I am wondering what Lindsay's true feelings are.
So I wrote a letter to that child.
Please take this to Lindsay and talk to her.
Tragedy struck the merchants of Asterleeds!
The "Night Wagon Attack," a dastardly crime committed on the streets of the city in the dark of night!

Now, let us join together in the investigation!
My name is Isial, and I am a librarian.
I am in charge of organizing materials and lending books at the "Rector's Big Bookcase" in the Pioneer Bureau.
In fact, there are some books that are not easily returned to .......
Could you please tell them to return it as soon as possible?
I am Manfredo. I'm a landowner.
Recently, musk moths have started to appear targeting our fields.
That didn't used to happen before, you know. However, they have suddenly increased in number recently, and even if you get rid of them, they keep coming back.
I want you to find out the cause of the problem.
The green pineapple is my dear friend!
I thought I would play today like I usually do. ......
Suddenly a purple pineapple came and stole my toys!
I tried to go get it back, but my mom said no, it's too dangerous. ......
Please!　Punish the purple pineapple instead of me!
My name is Craif the Adventurer.
I actually have a young son, in front of whom I have a young son,
I was so puffed up that my father could do anything.
Then my son believed it. ......
It's my fault for having a big mouth, but I don't want to disappoint my son.
Please, can you give me a hand?
Adventurers are always in danger.
And I'm also at risk ...... of my wallet!
So, in order to get out of the crisis, we are going to start developing new products!
I have a good idea!　Now I just need to get the materials!
We need you to gather material for <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>on our behalf!
My name is Andrew. I work for the Pioneer Bureau and study the ecology of the flora and fauna of the Asteria Plain.
Actually, I've had some disturbing things on my mind lately. There have been reports of sightings of <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>in Asteria Plain, where they are not supposed to be.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>is a carnivorous and very dangerous monster. If there is a change in its ecology, it will be troublesome.
We need your help in determining the cause and exterminating <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>.
My name is Sonia. People don't really understand me, but I enjoy collecting insects.
I think insects are the most beautiful things in the world. Like the sparkle of those wings, or the smooth sheen of their shells. ...... It's as if they are sent from heaven as a warning messenger to make known and punish people for their ugliness. ......
However, there are some insects that I just can't handle on my own.
Please go and collect giant bugs for my collection!
You still look great. Your star power is growing.
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?
I'm Barni, the world's first adventurer producer.
Today I would like to re-produce you as a bandit killer.
I've come up with a plan for that, too.
What do you say?　How about we join hands again?

Let's see who is the better bounty hunter!

And now he has become an all-rounder beyond them!
There is no longer any blind spot for me here!

Hello. My name is Cecil and I'm a bureau member of the Pioneer Bureau.
Fiel Pond is a treasure trove of medicinal herbs that few people know about.
Materials for recovery medicines used by adventurers are often collected here.
The vegetation in such "Fiel Pond" is being eaten away by an overabundance of Kaiser elk.
If this situation continues, the amount of medicinal herbs collected will be affected.
Please help us defeat the Kaiser Elk to protect medicinal herbs!

A new star vein hole was discovered in the Evergreen Desert's "Hollowed Tempest"!
In order to defend Asterleeds against the onrushing monsters, you are requested to participate in the "Battle of Defense".
When defending, the barrier is deployed on the Asterleeds Bridge.
Keep the barrier from being destroyed until help arrives.
Pioneer Bureau personnel are stationed in front of the entrance to Asterleeds to establish a defense system and to be on the lookout.
Could you please pass on the information to them and also check on the situation?
We are looking for challengers to "The Tower of Beginning"!

To one day solve the mystery of "The Tower of Beginnings".
We are looking forward to meeting you, the adventurers!
The Tower of Beginnings.
We are looking for skilled adventurers who can investigate deep into the "Pillar of Divinity" in "Divine Haven Hill".
Hyperactivity!　Pillar of Divinity" should be achieved.
A majestic tower where you can feel the presence of the Bapharia gods up close.
It is said that the deepest part of the temple is shrouded in mystery, and that those who approach the essence of the temple will face great challenges.

Do you use Arena?
This is a facility where visitors can experience heated battles in which they become challengers to the monsters that are sent their way.
We also recommend the Pioneer Station to improve the level of adventurers.
We invite you to try "Rush Battle Shodan" and see how good you are.
Aim for the champion!
We wish you the best of luck!

Please investigate the "Castenore Ruins" on the "Ritze Tradeway".
These are the Castenore Ruins of Fort Castenore Ruins, which was once the front line in the battle against the dragon tribe that established a major power in the Montegnor Valley.
In exchange for defeating the dragon tribe, the fort was completely destroyed and burned. Since the event took place in a remote area, no detailed records remain.
How did the ancient people fight and win against the dragon tribe? We want to discover even the slightest clue or trace.

I'm Alex, a new adventurer. Nice to meet you.
She's on an adventure with me, and she gave me an order ...... No, I was going to head to "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress" at her request.
However, the Pioneer Bureau stopped us. They said there was still a lack of research and that it was too dangerous for us.
So she got her navel bent. ......
You're saying that if more research is done, they'll be able to let newcomers in.

To the unnamed collaborator. I convey an urgent request.
The defense mechanism of "Chained One's Spawnery" seems to be operating beyond its original standards.
No direct impact on the functioning of the facility is expected, but even minor anomalies cannot be overlooked.
We conclude that the cause of the problem needs to be investigated.
Anyone who understands this content should respond immediately.
'The Second Coming!　Chained One's Spawnery"
This is an official request from the Order of Bapharia.
This request is only requested to be disclosed to certain persons.
The "Sanctuary of Blessings" still has many unknowns, and the Order has determined that further investigation is needed.
We must avoid any danger to the priestesses and priests of the oracle by the defense mechanism.
Please follow the route to the innermost part of the site and conduct a detailed survey.

Perhaps the throat was damaged by inhaling dust and sand for a long period of time. Normal cough medicines are not expected to be effective.
Please go to Torchlight Thickets and collect five "Breezia Flowers" for the medicine.

Hi, my name is Seilah, and I am a Spell Caster.
In Dragon Claw Valley, we found traces of a ritual in which someone had performed a ritual using Imagine.
The flow of engrams is beginning to be disrupted, and if left unchecked, the monsters from "Dragon Claw Valley" may go on the rampage and attack the surrounding towns and villages.
I will perform the ritual deactivation on my end. In the meantime, could you please calm down " <value type="enemyName" id="E002_03_00_03001"/>"?

I'm collecting ingredients for a medicine for a client. We're all running around, but there are so many and different kinds that it's a lot of work.
I need a little help!　Can you do me a favor?
I need you to deliver the "Yosai Stone" that can be collected at the "Boroum Ruins".

Please investigate the "Boroum Ruins" in "Shimmering Valley".
Although it is located in the desert, the temperature is stable, and it is known as a site where wild animals gather. However, it also seems to attract vicious monsters that see it as a hunting ground.
For the safety of the surrounding community, "Dig Hard!　Boroum Ruins" should be conducted.
The advanced survey is a challenging request. Please be careful when taking on this challenge.
'Digging Hard!　Boroum Ruins"
Please investigate the "Valley of Machines" in "Soundless Foothills".
The internal defense mechanism is suddenly activated, and the legacy of Bapharia appears one after another, which could affect the outside world as well.

Hiya, I am Rius, a farm knight of the Duchy of Bernhardt.
Did you know that Bernhardt Castle has an underground canal that was abandoned long ago?
The Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway in "Castle Shadows".
The entrance is supposed to be sealed off, but something is apparently wrong. I heard that there is a story about a machina that people in the past dumped in the canal and it became active and went out and destroyed the farmland.
I am a farmer, but I am also a knight. Since the king has given me this gift, I can't just ignore it.

Please take care, as I am sure it will be a difficult job.

Hey there, I'm Panayote, a Bapharia missionary.
Do you know the "Giant Tower Ruins" in "Andra Basin?"　It's a tower-like Bapharia ruin that is still shrouded in mystery.
I've got a colleague named Walken who likes to look into this and that. Apparently, the Bapharia heritage that's been hanging around in there lately is getting more belligerent.
Anyway, I brought that idiot Walken back. I told him it was dangerous, but he wouldn't listen to me.
While we're at it, why don't you clean up "A Different View!　Giant Tower Ruins" and get it back to a safe situation while you still can.
Advanced surveys are very difficult to do. If you're going to do it, be careful.
I'm counting on you then!

We are a group of historians from the Principality of Bernhardt.
I have been entrusted with the task of compiling the national history of the principality.
We are currently working on research and investigation for the "Drava Royal Research Institute". It is a negative history for the Principality, but because it is so, we must leave a correct record for future generations.
Nevertheless, the organization that managed the institute has been dismantled and the inside is in terrible shape. ......
The knights are also busy, and this is how we asked the adventurers to help us.
The "Intense Earthquake!　Drava Royal Research Institute" should be implemented.
This will be a difficult survey, so please be well prepared.

I'm going to get excited and use some special paper. Would you be able to gather that material for me?
I need you to go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>" in Evergreen Desert and pick up some "Sand Crackling Tree Flowers".

However, it seems that <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>has made it their territory.
You know how some birds like to collect shiny things?　Maybe they're interested in heritage in the same way.
So, they asked me to get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>, but they don't have the manpower.
It is located at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>".
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>Defeat, help me if you have the skill.

I am Tulka, an adventurer.
There is a grave marker at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>" in Evergreen Desert.
I found an offering of the belongings of an adventurer who had fallen in the middle of his ambition. ......
It's like <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>hanging around has broken the tombstone and swallowed it all up.
We cannot allow the peaceful sleep of our predecessors to be disturbed in such a way.
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>and retrieve the "Relics of a Brave Warrior".
Targets for collection (where available)

<value type="enemyName" id="E001_13_00_01001"/>is a dangerous existence where grudges and delusions gathered and did not properly become an Imagine.
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_13_00_01001"/>is one of the largest and most powerful of them all, so only skilled adventurers can be asked to take it down.

My name is Narai. I'm an antique dealer in Kanaloa.
I'm dealing with some of the best values I've found on the Coast and at the ruins.
I've been seeing <value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_00_01001"/>a lot lately when I've been exploring the "Rauleben Battlefield" area.
Apparently, they roost in ruins and rocky areas.
I do, and people in Kanaloa sometimes go to the Coast. If we are attacked, we are in trouble.
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_00_01001"/>and get rid of them.
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_00_01001"/>　15 bodies (Rauleben Battlefield)
My name is Paolo. I'm a traveling puppeteer.
I heard that there is a machine-like monster called Makina Fox in "Castle Shadows" in West Bernhardt Peninsula.
I also make dolls. I think their body structure could be a good clue.
Can you go defeat the Makina Fox and collect the "Parts of the Mechanical Fox"?
I think I can come up with a new form of puppetry. Thanks in advance for your help.

I'm Akka, a miner who works in the mines in Litze.
The other day I saw a monster I'd never seen before, and I panicked and ran away.
Rumor has it that it's a Canny Mook Scout called " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_01_01001"/>".
He said he was a much worse guy than ordinary Mooks.
I can't do my job with any peace of mind.
Can you go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>" and take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_01_01001"/>"?
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_01_01001"/>　( <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>)
I'm Rueben, a dairy farmer in Minsterhorn.
I got some livestock feed from Litze, and there was a pineapple mixed in with the box.
I wondered if I bought this stuff, and then suddenly it burst!
It was just a loud noise, though, and I wasn't hurt. But I was startled.
It must be the work of " <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_01_01001"/>" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>". He is famous for being a prankster.
I hope you can discourage them from doing bad things.

I am Fritz, a soldier in Bernhardt's army.
I went out to "Rauleben Battlefield" to investigate and found something nasty.
The footprints of a special individual of the Little Goat, " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_06_01_01001"/>", were left all over the place.
I have reported to my superiors, but I am currently on a different mission and must proceed with that one.
Can you please take care of this before any damage is done?
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_06_01_01001"/>　（Rauleben Battlefield）
We are a group of fishermen from Kanaloa.
Recently, many of the fish we have caught have been devoured.
They ate in a terrible way. He would eat anything and everything he could get his hands on, head and belly notwithstanding, and rip them to shreds.
I asked him to look into it, and he told me that it was the work of " <value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_01_01001"/>," one of the most troublesome crab spiders.
If things continue as they are, we will dry up.
He must be hiding somewhere in "Rauleben Battlefield". Can you help me defeat him?

My name is Anelma, a Bapharia priest of Kanaloa.
A villager has seen a special individual of Skyfish called " <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_03_01001"/>" at "Stahl Coast".
I am ashamed to say that I am not liked by the Knights of Bernhardt. ......
It would take a long time to ask the Knights of Columbus to do this.
Can you please ask adventurers to take them down?

I'm Barni, the world's first adventurer producer!
I've come up with the perfect plan to make you shine this time.
I'm taking down a stray machina in Bernhardt!
Between you and me, I've heard that the machina, which is not under the control of the Knights of Bernhardt, is going to be around the streets and fields.
If we can prevent the damage before it happens, we'll be on our way to the stars in no time!
Come on, let's go for it!　The Machina Buster to save us all!
Hello!　I, Pissary, an adventurer.
Actually, its ....... I got ...... lost .......
I have a delivery for a soldier of the Duchy of Bernhardt, but I don't think I'll be able to give it to him anytime soon at this rate.
Please!　Take me to the Duchy of Bernhardt!
Please stay with me until I give the delivery to the soldier!
My name is Areni. I am a cook.
When I season it, it always turns out to be very hot. ...... The customers cry out and say, "It's so good!
However, the customer who came the other day didn't seem to be in any pain at all, and had a complicated expression on his face.
I had never met someone like that before. I was kind of curious.
Adventurer, could you please find that customer?
I am Mino!　I'm the strongest and loneliest Sargent!
My life-long rival!　I've changed!
They were trained and disciplined in Bernhardt's traditional military-style training methods!
I, who love my country and have awakened to my mission to be a shield for my people, challenge you to a fight!
I don't know how many times I've done this already, but I'm not giving up on winning!
Here we go!　Sir, yes, sir!
Come on, in Isaac, the miner of Litze.
Actually, our master, Mr. Baumann, is worried about his successor.
His son, Einar, has run away from home and there is no one left to take over the business.
I heard that Mr. Einar had a tremendous talent as a miner.
I would like to have a long talk with you once.
Would you please take me to see Mr. Einar?
I'm not ......, my name is Guicaro!
He is a new recruit of the glorious Duchy of Bernhardt.
Recently, my sister who lives in Kanaloa ...... Oh, no!　There seems to be some weird stuff going on at my sister's place.
I am on a mission and cannot move. But I am worried about my sister ...... sister.
Can you please look into this, including the cause if possible?
I've come up with a new menu, but I'm having a bit of a problem.
I can't find a supplier of vegetables for the ingredients.
No one seems to be making them around here.
I know it's a long drive, but could you do it for me?
Hi baboon......, I'm Rike, the formulator.
I have something I need you to get for me in the West Bernhardt Peninsula.
I was looking for someone who could go there.
If we get that thing, we'll be one step closer to a makeover drug, baboon. ......
You're interested, too, aren't you?
Baboon ...... please take care of me.
I'm trying again the 400 year old weaponry process.
Asterleeds was just being built, but they were making surprisingly high quality weapons.
Apparently, there is a clue in the "fusion of metal and living organisms.
There are people today who were created with similar ideas.
Could you gather some material as a sample?
My name is Geiler. I may look like this, but I am a seasoned adventurer.
Livestock in the area have recently been attacked by monsters.
The culprit is <value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_01001"/>. They are nasty even for me, a seasoned adventurer.
But we can't just leave them alone.
If someone mistakenly meddles with the livestock in an attempt to protect them, we are in trouble.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_01001"/>Can you help us take them down?
Mr. Adventurer ...... not very cheery, but will you listen to me?
I need you to find my fiancé, Yoan.
I heard from a friend of Yoan's the other day. He said he fought a monster in Montegnor Valley and lost track of him. ......
Of course I believe he's alive!　But you can find out more at .......
Please. Find Yoan.
I'm ready to accept whatever the outcome is. ......
Time is full. ......ッ
That is why I have been pursuing him for a long time.
I must capture him, even if it costs me my life!　The time has finally come to settle the matter!
We would like to ask for the presence of appropriate persons to discuss this matter.
In order to fulfill my long-cherished desire, I ask for your help once again!
I'm Aurelie the Sculptor!　I'm gonna carve, I'm gonna carve, I'm gonna carve!
We came all the way to Kanaloa to carve a new soul!
This time, the Knights of Bernhardt asked me to create a statue of a knight!
Wild &amp; Battle!　Dynamic &amp; Stalwart!
There are some materials that are desperately needed to create my masterpiece!
I need your help!
Hello!　I'm Anne, a merchant and inventor.
I've inspired another new product!
The skin is already dry and cracked in the desert.
I want to make a hand cream that solves these problems in one shot!
How's it going?　I'm going good, aren't I?
So, can we ask them to collect materials?
We are searching for E-chan, who has gone out of the mansion. I'm so tired!
I think he probably has an engram cut and is rolling around in there. That's what happens to people when they get tired, right? Just like that.
Without them, the master's work would be compromised.
Can you help us collect eechan?
We had a special drill to strengthen the security force, and some of the new recruits got isolated in the danger zone.
It's a shameful story, isn't it?
So we are going to rescue them, but it would be troublesome if we cause secondary damage.
The big guys are yapping again.
I'm sorry, but could you give me a hand with this?
I'm Thierry, an up-and-coming fashion designer!
We got off to a good start with the successful opening of our brand new store.
But this is not me who is satisfied!
For further progress, the next step is to win the contest!
And for that, I need to tailor the best dress I can.
Can you help me finish the dress?
I am Mordo. I'm the one who manages the oasis in Salamzart.
A strange odor was recently identified at the Oasis.
Perhaps the cause is in the "Khartoum Ruins". It's connected to a deep underground water vein.
I would like to head out to investigate, but the monsters that appear in the "Kartoum Sandway" are an obstacle.
Could we ask them to take it down?
Yo, I'm Iggworth, a guy who hangs out at Coin Pavilion.
I've been making various hangouts among my friends. This is one of them.
I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble using Bernhardt's safe house lately.
I'm kind of suddenly covered in monsters.
It's a secret hideout, so you don't want to make it too obvious.
I can ask the adventurer to go and clean it up a bit.
My name is Clarissa.
I came from Asterleeds to have my precious jewelry box repaired.
I was told that it was very difficult to fix, so I came to Litze, where there are skilled craftsmen. ......
Actually, I lost the all-important jewelry box!
I, I don't know what to do. ......
Adventurer, please can you help us?
I am Regina. I'm the heiress of a blacksmith.
Actually, my parents' business is in trouble. ...... I bought a new, expensive furnace without thinking twice.
We need to hit a mountain somehow and turn things around.
But the furnace is really good and can produce high quality armor plates.
I would like to make this my official employment with the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt.
Can you help us to rebuild our family's finances?
Hi, hi, hi. My name is Rius, a farm knight from the Principality of Bernhardt.
They call me a knight, but I'm just a humble farmer.
In. I heard that the harvest around here has been declining lately and everyone is having trouble.
We found the cause, but we needed materials to counteract the problem.
I would like to ask the adventurers to help us.
Please help me help all the farmers out there.
It's just like a poor peddler's ada.
I travel a lot to and from the Principality of Bernhardt in the course of my business. I overheard something that was a bit disturbing.
I have a monster I'd like you to take down in Bernhardt, but it seems to be hanging around in a nasty spot.
I was looking for an adventurer with a good arm, and a good mouth on top of that.
You seem to meet both conditions. Can you do one thing for me?
My name is Amado. I'm a merchant ...... or maybe I'm still an apprentice merchant.
I'm making all kinds of preparations to start doing business.
I have a plant that I'm thinking of making into a featured product, but it seems that monsters appear in the places where it can be harvested.
So I'd like to request a fact-finding mission on the monsters and to take them down.
The reward will be worth it!
If we don't spend now for future glory, there is no point!
My name is Seto, a soldier of the Principality of Bernhardt.
We have recently been experiencing a lot of damage caused by <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>. We are busy with extermination plans and arrangements.
As expected, I wanted a vacation, but I accidentally forgot to pick up my vacation request forms at .......
And I don't have time to go get it.
Excuse me. Could you please get a permission letter from your superior?
Johnson, an engineer of Bapharia's heritage.
There's an antique dealer in Kanaloa named Narai. He's always sending me interesting inheritances.
He has a nose for business and picks up legacies at a pretty good pace.
However, he stopped contacting me recently.
I hope it's just that they can't find the estate, but I'd be worried if something happened to them.
Can you go check on him for a minute?
Nice to meet you!　I'm Nina, a stuffed animal!
That's Rebecca, the owner, holding Nina. Nice to meet you!
Rebecca wants to thank you for all the help you've given her.
But Rebecca is shy and very uncomfortable talking to people.
So I wanted a kind person to help me.
Please. Will you go with Rebecca and say thank you?"
My name is Lutz, a civil official of the Principality of Bernhardt.
We are currently working on a project to improve an old underground canal.
Accordingly, we are looking for adventurers who are willing to investigate the underground canals.
We would like you to actually go into the canal and make sure there is no danger.
I've been impatiently awaiting the results from the upper management. ......
Are there any adventurers who would like to help us?
My name is Anelma, a Bapharia priest.
Have you ever heard of the "Drava Royal Research Institute"?
This facility is located in Bernhardt Castle. Due to various complicated circumstances, we need to investigate the interior for future use.
I have been asking the Knights of Columbus for help, but there has been slow progress.
We have no choice but to ask our adventurers for help.
Can you please send me a copy of "Drava Royal Research Institute, Additional Research"?
Welcome. I'm Paulette, the smoker.
My new smoking kiln is working great. It doesn't explode anymore and the smoked flavor has increased.
So, now I want to be particular about the chips, too.
There's a rumor that there's a good source of Kemuri in Dragon Claw Valley.
I bet it would make an amazing smoked fish.
Adventurer, I'd like you to go and pick some.
I am Cindy, a maid working for Detective Guido.
The master has now asked me to solve the riddle of a message that says the location of a certain millionaire's vast inheritance.
The key phrase is 'fur woven with jade.
Apparently, this is the fur of " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" that appears on " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>".
If we leave it alone, the master may say he will defeat it himself. Could you go ahead and defeat it secretly and deliver the "fur woven with jade" to him?

I'm Poirier, an apprentice employee of the Imagine Institute.
I'm going to give a special class on Imagine to the kids at school.
Huovi?　You're all over the place, "Why don't you just play hide-and-seek with them?" You don't understand, Huovi!
I'm going to make a big difference here and look back at that charlatan brother!
I want to create my very own Imagine, and I need your help.
I want you to go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>" and defeat " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_02_01001"/>" and get "Pulsating Bristles"!
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_02_01001"/>( <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>)

Baron Trima thinks that if he keeps his "sharpened sword feathers" on display, it will protect him from monsters and give him peace of mind.
And then we prepare the rewards.
You can think that a baron is as good as it gets, right?
Can I gossip about your philanthropic avoidance of fighting?

The Order of Bapharia will make the request.
Did you know that we recently issued a permit for the restoration and improvement of motor vehicles?
The use of ever more advanced technology was recognized.
The vehicles owned by the Bapharia Order will also be improved on this occasion.
In "Giant Tower Ruins, Investigation," it is documented that usable metal plates are available.
We need the cooperation of all adventurers.
May, who helps the team with everything. Thank you very much for your help.
I'm going to have a field day with all the newcomer teams.
And I was thinking of a prize for the winner... Mea culpa, you know?
Let's do some awesome dungeon treasures and show them that there's always someone better!"
I'm not a good person to say such a thing.
If I do, I have to make sure I have something great, don't I?
If you do the "Sophra's Mountain Path Survey," I think you'll find some serious stuff.
I'm sure the newcomers will be surprised, and I'm counting on you.
I am Scherni, a member of the Order of Bernhardt.
My superior, Captain Vilmer, is very hard on the Bapharia priests.
Especially Anelma in Kanaloa. You are a bit of a fighter when it comes to competing with each other for anything.
It's kind of like the captain only becomes childish when talking to Anelma.
...... Maybe you like Anelma, don't you?
I wondered what would happen if I pretended to be Anelma and sent flowers or something to the captain.
Can you please collect the "Crescent Moonbeam" that blooms at "Rauleben Battlefield"?
20 crescent daisies (Rauleben Battlefield)
Vilmer, a squad leader of the Bernhardt Knights.
I would like you to collect an ore called "Ran-kirit-iron" at "Rauleben Battlefield".
There's a shortage. I hear the blacksmiths in Kanaloa are in trouble.
The people of the Duchy of Bernhardt are protected by us, the Knights of Bernhardt. This is true not only in battle, but also in our daily lives.
We will not let the Bapharia cult play nice. Especially that female priestess Anelma!
She's a little pretty and witty, and the residents of Kanaloa depend on her, so she's in a good mood. ...... Gephon, gephon!
Anyway, I'm asking you!
20 random cut iron (Rauleben Battlefield)
This is an urgent request from the Pioneer Bureau!
We have confirmed the appearance of "The Shifting Snake Emperor" in "Insect Fortress of Dawn" in Evergreen Desert.
Because of this, the insects that nest in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress" have scattered to various places.
If this situation continues, the damage will spread to towns, villages, and streets!
The Pioneering Bureau will take care of the insects, and in the meantime, we ask that the original culprit, the "Shifting Snake Emperor," be defeated!

Narai, an antique dealer in Kanaloa.
I went looking for a bargain the other day at the old warren, and came across a strange place.
In an eerie, foggy forest. ...... From behind the trees, I heard a tremendous earth tremor.
So that's what they call the "dwelling place of the spirits of the damned"? I had heard rumors about it, but I thought it was just a joke.
If so, it was "King Mook" who was deep in the forest.
If that thing crawled out, it would be beyond dangerous.
Can't you do something about "King Mook"?

I'm Herit, the delivery guy!
When the weather is nice, you want to go for a walk, don't you? I often forget about work and go for a walk here and there.
So I found "Thieves' Falls" behind the waterfalls in the "Minster Hills."
I did a little exploring, and I got right eye-to-eye with the King Goblin.
I was indeed surprised, but it was a nice walk!
I want to go exploring again, so can you help me take down the King Goblin?

I'm Mordo, the water quality manager for the oasis in Salamzart.
It was a bad situation.
There is a place called "Yellow Sand Cove" in "Olvid Plains," and there are people who say they saw "Pridok" there.
It is a legacy of the large Bapharia, which, when it gets out of control, destroys the whole place and leaves it covered in sand and stones.
Water sources may also be affected.
I need you to investigate the "Yellow Sand Cove Freedom Search" and take down the "Pridoque".

I am a peddler Bessemer.
Have you ever been to the "Ancient Path of the Falling Sun" in "Divine Haven Hill"?
There is a rumor among my fellow peddlers that a type of ore called "halo ore" can be found.
It gives off a pale light, and just looking at it makes me feel kind of grateful.
I went to get it a couple of times too, but apparently with no luck, I couldn't find it at all. ......
People say it's easy to find, but that's odd.
That's why I want you to collect "halo gemstones.
Demand seems to be increasing, so I'm asking for a little more.

It was reported that the "Dread Rattler of the Ice Floor" has been sighted in the "Sand Diameter of the Sea Moonlight" in the "Shimmering Valley."
The surrounding area has beautiful starry skies and is a popular destination for travelers and adventurers. We hear that sightseeing tours are also scheduled for the town's residents.
Accepting the influence of the "Dread Rattler of the Ice Floor," the surrounding monsters are likely to go berserk, making the situation very dangerous.
I request that the "Dread Rattler of the Ice Floor" be defeated as soon as possible!

Sorry about that. My nose is not feeling well again. ......
Have you ever heard of a place called "Sophra's Mountain Path" in the "Melisos River Basin" of the Montegnor Valley?
The "dalzinia grass" flowers from there are giving off a seasonal fragrance!　Hekkushun!
...... I can't enjoy it with my nose right now.
Can I ask you to collect "Dalzinia grass"?
I hope the adventurers enjoy the scent of the flowers too.

I am Andor. I'm a good fisherman from Asterleeds!
I heard a rumor on the wind that fish and shell fossils can be found in the "Ghost Valley of the Hidden Moon.
Even if it is a fossil, I can't shut up when I hear it is a fish!　Moreover, I heard that some pretty big ones can be found!
I'd like you to go and collect "fossils of old rock whales".
When I get it, I'll display it in the best part of my room!
9 fossils of old rock whales (Moon Hidden Gorge) / Minerals
I am Aleni, the cook at Asterleeds.
The other day, a customer told me about an interesting ingredient.
It's a type of shellfish found in the southern islands, and I was told that the more you chew it, the deeper the flavor deepens, making it perfect for my cooking.
I, for one, can't help but get a little spicy in my seasoning.
So I thought that if I cooked with just the flavors of the ingredients, I could create a different taste.
Could you please collect "Gokkarakara shells" that can be collected at the watering hole of "Ia Mole Reef"?
10 Gokkarakara shells (Ia Mole Reef) / aquatic
There is a Gilmy Warrior called "Dragon Armor of the Waterside" at "Shiohae Beach" in Cape Rauwehara.
It seems that they are called brave monsters among the Gilmey hordes and are allowed to wear special armor.
Maybe it's a sign of their willingness to protect their friends in their own way.
However, we cannot overlook the damage they cause by attacking human settlements!
I'll go around evacuating people and checking on other monsters. In the meantime, I ask you to take down the "Dragon Armor of the Waterside".
If it's a fight for protection, we can't back down either!
1 "Dragon Armor by the Waterfront" (Shiohae Beach)
There is a strange Girmee called "The Priestess of Sacrifice" in "The Hidden Valley of the Moon.
I heard that they repeat rituals and experiments in order to become stronger, and that they chop up animals, spread blood, and all sorts of bad taste.
They found traces of it just the other day. If people were to get involved, it would be a big problem.
I'll take care of the zakos, and you take down the "priest chief of the sacrificial demand!
Let's show them that such things are not real strength!

There is an amazing mano called "The Iron Fist of the Great Wave Breaker" at "Ia Mole Reef" in Cape Rauwehara.
As the name suggests, it punches up a big wave or .......
Blast Archer received a request to take down a herd with such a guy!
Please lend me your power as well!　I will clean up the cronies and ask you to defeat the "Iron Fist of the Great Wave Breaker"!
Let's show them the power of our friendship!

Hi, I am Seilah, Spell Caster. You can find me at ...... pff.
Oh, I'm sorry!　I actually laughed at the monster with the weird name. ......
It's a "picker-pecker" that's said to go out to the "Tidal Waiting Beach" at Cape Rauwehara. Pfft!　Hmmm... .......
Because it's "Pikkari Pekka" with a pikkari glowing pekka, right?
It's oddly wordy and kind of cute sounding. ......
And anyway!　I need information on this monster. It's a serious request for my 'quest'!
Please take down the "Picky Pecker"!
......Pickering, pecking......pfft!
1 "Piccalipecker" (Shiohayabashi beach)
There was a skyfish in "The Valley of the Hidden Moon" who was a very good swimmer.
They seem to enjoy looking down on the fleeing people from above as they persistently target the peddlers' carts.
All the merchants were crying. I couldn't stay silent any longer!
Leave the peddler escort to me. You can go wild as much as you want.
Let's blow the "Light Sky Swimmer" out of the water!

There's a Girmee who has fought many battles in the Ia Mole Reef in Cape Rauwehara called "The Stiff Arm of the Herd Scatterer".
He is said to be a great guy who could drive away goblins, ogres, and other higher-ranked people.
It's kinda cool, isn't it? .......
But if they want to attack a human village, that's a different story!
I heard that the "Stiff Arm of the Herd Scattering" and his minions are moving suspiciously.
We'll protect the village, you take down the 'herd-scattering stiffs'!
We're not like those other monsters!　It's a game!
1 "Stiff Arm of the Flock Scatterer" (Ia Mole Reef)
I'm Glen, a beat performer!　I'll be ringing again today!
I've run into some bad guys, could you help me out?
He is the "Breaker of Providence" in "Everfall Forest.
I found a corpsman who was about to be destroyed by this guy and went to his rescue, which was fine.
Everyone was so scared that they wouldn't let go of me.
It can't be helped. This is when we need music!
I'm going to play to cheer them up and escort them back to the city!
I want you to use your power to defeat the "Breakers of Providence"!　I beg you!

Have you heard of the "Arsenal of the Exiled" in "Fiel Pond"?
It seems that a gang of bad bandits has taken up residence there.
As for the ruins being razed, well, that place is a bit of a requiem stage.
It's also the resting place of the heroes who scattered to defend our country.
It would ruin the name of beat performers to allow bandits to live in such a place!
It's just frustrating, but with my ability, I've got my hands full with Zako.

Recently, an increasing number of adventurers have been brought in injured after attempting the Kartoum Sandway.
It appears that we have encountered a different kind of vicious monster than in peacetime.
If monsters were to crawl out of the ruins, the safety of the desert would be threatened.
'Labyrinth!　Kartoum Sandway" is requested.
This will be a difficult survey, so be sure to be fully prepared.
May God bless you in Bapharia.
'Labyrinth!　Kartoum Sandway"
This is the Knights of Bernhardt.
I would like to request the adventurers for "Dash!　Alston Mine" to the adventurers.
The objective is to explore the interior terrain and the monsters that appear, and to understand the overall danger.
Military personnel like us are not well trained to make comprehensive decisions, if only on the combat side.
Hence, we look forward to the broad knowledge of the adventurers.
This survey is expected to be extremely difficult.
I want someone with solid competence to be in charge.
Dash!　Alston Mine
Oh, I'm Panayote, a Bapharia priest. Do you thank God for me?
I'm talking about the appearance of "Overdraug Alma" in "Candlemere Tomb."
Draugs are usually trapped by regret, grudge, and other bad feelings. This one seems to have a terrible rage, as if it resents everything in the world.
It's a place, and a lot of things must be piling up.
I don't like preaching, but it is a priest's duty to guide the lost soul. Oh well.
I need you to take down "Overdraug Alma".
I'll at least say a prayer for you when I'm done. You got it.
1 "Overdraug Alma" (Candlemere Tomb, free search)
My name is Tregano. I'm a painter who mainly paints landscapes.
The "Forest of Flower Light - Free Exploration" is said to be thick with glowing plants that create a fantastic sight at night.
I would love to paint it, but my daughter Lobel is giving me the stink-eye.
I can't just leave him alone and go out.
I would like to obtain at least a plant to enhance the image.
Could you please explore the "Forest of Flower Light - Free Exploration" and pick up some "firefly lilies"?
11 firefly lilies (free exploration in the forest of flower light) / Plants
Water pollution due to engram disturbance was observed in some oases.
Since the "Red Ore Quarry" is located upstream of the water vein, we believe that the overcrowding of monsters inhabiting the area may be the cause.
Water is the root of human life. We cannot allow monsters to destroy it.
Would you be willing to conduct a "Red Ore Quarry Survey" to see what's going on inside?
Red Ore Quarry, Survey.
I'm Baumann, a master miner in Litze.
I heard the roar of a monster that looked bad coming from the area around the Castenore Ruins.
The young people are too scared to do their jobs.
I didn't see him, but it sure makes my skin tingle just to hear his voice.
That doesn't sound half-bakedly strong.
Strictly Dark!　Castenore Ruins" can you help me?
Only those adventurers who are skilled enough to do so should Accept this request.
'Strict Darkness!　Castenore Ruins"
Hello again, I am Rius, a farm knight of the Duchy of Bernhardt.
The "King Dogolman" has taken up residence in the ruins of an old mine called the "Alston Abandoned Mine.
They are so loud, their roar can be heard over the mountains.
It's scaring the animals, and it's going to affect our crops.
This makes it difficult for us to go out to the fields in a calm manner.
Please help us defeat "King Dogolman".

I am William, the butler who works for Remigio Bocchan.
I heard that my son was shown the fossil in a class at school, and he became interested in it.
I want to get the "old limestone" that contains coral fossils, which can be found in the "free exploration of the shallows of the rock shelf".
These things are not to be kept to oneself, but to be enjoyed by all!" and we would appreciate it if you could bring a few to distribute to all of your schoolmates.

My name is Labori. I'm an interpreter for the language of monsters at the Pioneer Station.
And then I heard the goblins talking about it.
There seems to be some disturbing activity among the monsters at the "Mayuki Throne".
I can't translate all the details, but I got a bad vibe from it.
Can you please do a "Mayuki Goza, Survey" for us?
If we can prevent the incident from happening, they will understand the importance of a monster interpreter. I'm counting on you!

I'm Nenemarina, I'm a soapmaker.
It seems that the soaps I make are becoming popular in Asterleeds.
So the merchants order a lot.
Then we ran out of materials.
I was going to take a break for a while, but the merchant would rush me ["], hurry up, hurry up! [I was going to take a break for a while, but the merchant kept rushing me.
Is there really such a rush?　It can't be helped.
Adventurer, would you please collect the ingredients for the soap?
My name is Lakaka, a warrior of the forest people.
In fact, I lost my precious amulet ring in the "Valley of the Coral Rocks".
I'd like to go get it, but I'm afraid I won't have the amulet at hand. ......
I need a new amulet to help me find mine!
However, it's not so easy to find a talisman that grabs my attention.
Please!　Go look for the amulet I lost, please!
I am Omarul, a forest folk. I'm researching old folklore and stories.
I wanted to keep a decent record for my children, grandchildren, and descendants even further down the road.
But there's a lot of ambiguity in the old stories. It's only reported as ["]a cave somewhere ["]or .......
After doing some research, I think it might be a place called "Sea God's Cavern".
I need you to go to the site and check it out.
A regular asked me if he could have the bento I used to make again.
However, the ingredients needed for these lunches are no longer available. I can't make them the way they used to be.
Just find some foodstuffs that might be a good substitute!　Could you pick these up for me?
I'll take one for the regulars and a lunch box of memories!
I'm a baboon...... formulator lyc.
I had a little accident. They confiscated my experimental materials for the shape-shifting drug.
We need someone to get a new one for us, baboon. ......
But the destination is Cape Rauwehara, across the ocean.
Who knows how many people you can ask?
I won't make it bad, okay?　baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon ......

He told me that he ["]didn't care ["]but I did indeed do something bad. I want to apologize.
However, I'm not a good talker. I feel that words alone are too thin .......
So I'm going to make a gift to thank them for everything they've done.
Could you gather some materials?
I'm Regina, the blacksmith's heiress.
As usual, our finances are on fire. ......
I went to the trouble of getting research funds from the Order, but my father used it all up very quickly!
That's because I wanted to use good, expensive tools too, but come on. ......
In the first place, ["]to develop and deliver materials useful to the Knights of Bernhardt["]"] is a condition, right?
You haven't done anything yet!
Please!　Help us before they take away your research funding -!
I am Feodor, a scholar. I study meteorology.
In order to realize weather forecasts, he travels around the country and collects weather records.
This time I'm going to set up my observation equipment in Montegnor Valley.
The top of "Tower Rock" would be ideal, but difficult to get to.
It is especially difficult if you wander into the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins".
I guess the first step would be to make an accurate map of the surrounding area.
I wonder if you could step over the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins" and let me know what it looks like.
Hello. My name is Melis.
I'm looking for ingredients for a dish right now.
It's a seafood from Cape Rauwehara, so you can't get it in Minsterhorn.
But you're an adventurer, you can get there, right?
I really want to get it!　Please, help me!
Let me tell you, it's just that it's a delicious ingredient, okay?
I don't believe in such lore as, "If you eat it, you'll fall in love."
Bo-yi-yi, Mr. Adventurer!　Hurry up and lend us your strength!
My name is Lasse. I am a scholar who studies and promotes animal husbandry.
Adventurers, you know Elsi, the meat butcher, don't you?
When livestock are harmed, it is that girl who goes off to take them down at once!
Again, ......, as livestock sheep were attacked in Larpal.
Please!　Please help us stop Elsi!
I'm Kainalulu, a restorer from Jubilia.
Unusual for a woodsman, huh?　Haha, I get that a lot!
Restorers are a precious commodity on the outer continent.
Every day, I'm working impatiently as work comes in.
That's all well and good, but I'm out of materials to use for restoration and I'm in trouble!
I've got some work that's due!　Oh no!　Somebody help me!
I am Hohoi, the hunter of Jubilia.
Several of my friends have been attacked and injured by earth sky fish.
It shouldn't have been a big opponent, but even the best hunters were hit.
It is difficult to protect a village if you don't know why.
Can you help us to determine the cause?
I'm Anne, a genius inventor and future great merchant!
It should be time to come up with a hit product.
This time, it's a luxury down comforter!
Moreover, I also prepared a seamless idea that would appeal to children.
Oh no, this is going to sell. I'm going to make a fortune!
I'll share with the adventurers, so make sure you have good materials!
I am Mimi Olina.
I'm in trouble because the place where we worship God has been vandalized.
And when I say God, I don't mean the God of Bapharia.
The sea goddess has long been worshipped in Cape Rauwehara.
It seems that the monsters took away the offerings to the sea god.
Please, please take back the offerings!
I am Maurili, a medicine man.
There are signs of an epidemic these days. I see people coughing from time to time.
I'm trying to get the meds ready now.
The key to these things is to get a handle on them as soon as possible.
I'm going to concentrate on making medicines, so could you please collect the materials at "Ia Mole Reef"?
I am Joel, a traveler!
I'm traveling and gaining experience to join the Order of Bernhardt.
I'm not running away from home, I'm traveling!　Don't get me wrong, okay?
When they see my abilities, I'm sure they will want to recruit me from the knighthood.
I need to talk to the Knights of Columbus, so please hang out with me for a minute!
How are you, kind adventurer?
Actually, the blacksmith I have been getting to know has stopped delivering items to me.
They are worried that they might be in some kind of trouble.
I would like to go check on him, but I am not sure if the child would be careless on his own.
I would be happy to accompany you for a bit.
If nothing else, of course, that's the best. Hmmm.
I have my men training an expedition to Cape Rauwehara.
There are monsters over there that are different from those on the Magna continent.
Don't come back until we take them down!　I told him, but he's struggling a bit.
It's fine if they don't come back, but we can't leave the town empty forever.
I'm going to collect it. I'm going to collect them. Sorry, can you help me?
I am Scherni of the Order of Bernhardt~.
Our Captain Vilmer and Bapharia Priest Anelma are kind of suspicious, aren't they?
Whenever we see each other, all we do is fight. And yet, they are always involved with each other because of some mission or other.
Could this be a maybe, just a maybe?
And then I was called by both of them.
Since we are here, I will try to find out how they are getting along with each other by running errands.
Would you mind following us, adventurer?
Hey, I'm Panayote. I'm a Bapharia priest.
Do you know an adventurer named Pissary?
She's famous for getting lost easily. Maybe you've seen her somewhere.
I heard that this Pissary is working hard on something he wants to do.
I need your help.
Well, I'm also set to have Pissary found. ......
It's a peddler's bessemer.
Actually, I mistook an important item to give to a customer.
And it's required for the Bapharia ritual, and even the cultists have been staring at me. ......
We need to retrieve the goods as soon as possible and deliver them back to them.
Please help me before it gets any more important!　Please!
This is Cecil from the Pioneer Bureau.
There was an incident in which the wagons of the merchants' association in Larpal were attacked and their cargo was robbed.
It is a very aggressive approach, and it is not an exaggeration to say that it is robbery.
I would like to get my stuff back, but it's not easy to do that when you're dealing with a bunch of thugs. ......
It's going to be a long itinerary, can you help us?
I am a caponono living in Jubilia.
I got something from an adventurer I helped once.
It is a legacy of Bapharia that is useful when fishing in the sea.
I am interested but I have no fishing experience and don't really know how to use it.
Could you please consult with me for a moment?
I am Mino!　I'm the strongest and loneliest one-man army!

I'm Carrion, a new guard of the Order of Bapharia.

No. ...... maybe that's my true ability?
But, I can't do it this time!　Absolutely impossible!

Hu ....... My name is Aaron. I'm a self-proclaimed professional archaeologist.
I came across "Iron Coffin" in "Giant Tower Ruins."
It is the legacy of poor Bapharia, which has been trapped in ruins for a long time.
Please visit ....... I was the one who took the excess of power and feelings head-on.
I got blown up so spectacularly that I hurt my back somewhat.
Huff ....... Can you clear up some long-standing feelings on my behalf?

I found a rare mineral at a place called "Leaky Mine, Free Exploration.
It's called "Dusk Lamp Stone" and it's going to be used a lot in the maintenance of the armory. Could you please collect some and deliver them to me?
I've been summoned by the captain to a meeting. He said something about the discipline and discipline in the barracks.
...... I thought I paid for my losses this month, how did they find out?
Anyway, please collect it in the "Leaky Abandoned Mine, Free Search"!
It looks like it's hard to see with all the gas inside, so please be careful there!

My name is Ferena, a scholar from Salamzart.
Please allow me to request a survey of the "Sienne Ruins".
According to historical records, a large city of an ancient civilization flourished in that area. And yet, it was destroyed overnight.
It is said that he was touched by the wrath of the gods of Bapharia, but the details are still unknown.
It is a great mystery in ancient history, and I have no end of interest in it.
Scholars can unravel the mysteries and adventurers can explore the ruins. It's mutually beneficial, don't you think?
Siennese Ruins and Surveys", thank you very much.
Siennese Ruins, Investigations
I am Berger of the Pioneer Bureau. He is in charge of guiding the adventurers in their training and analyzing their strength.
Have you ever heard of "Kahuna's Cave" in Cape Rauwehara?
It is important in the ancient beliefs of the region and is a rare environment and ecosystem not found on the Magna continent.
The Pioneer Bureau would also like to promote research and surveys, but the number of adventurers who can take on the challenge here is quite limited.
I just want to make sure I find out how well they can handle it.
'Torrent!　Request a challenge to "Kahuna's Cave".
You should be able to make it through with flying colors!

This is Andrew, a bureau agent at the Pioneer Bureau.
I would like to investigate "Ia Mole Reef" in Cape Rauwehara as part of a monster ecology study.
The "Swamp Lizard" is inhabiting there, and its numbers are increasing rapidly.
Ideally, humans and monsters should coexist in harmony, but if they increase at that rate, living areas such as Jubilia will be threatened.
Could you please reduce the number of "Swamp Lizard" to some extent for the investigation of the cause?

This is the research team from Basdolphin University.
In The Forest of Silence, there was talk of seeing plants similar to those in Asteria Plain.
The "feather dandelion," which sends its seeds flying in the wind, seems to be growing.
If we can get a sample, it may prove that "feather dandelion" seeds can cross oceans.
We would like to conduct cultivation experiments on the premises, so could you please provide us with a certain number of plants in bulk?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation in our research.
14 feather dandelions (Silent Forest) / Plants
You know the Matinee Gob Warrior in "Silent Forest"?
Matinee Gob Warrior.
He told me that the baron's investment in a trading company had been attacked. All the merchants were safe, but a lot of their stuff was stolen.
Business is about trust, but Baron Tolima thinks that this is only possible when security and safety are guaranteed by eliminating people like the Matinee Gob Warrior.
And then we ask the best adventurers to take them down.
You can't think of the Baron as a do-er when he does it, okay?
I'm sure you have an economic point of view as well, and you can gossip about it, right?

Jubilia Tourism Association.
We are currently setting up a tourist billboard as part of our activities, but it has been delayed by a vicious goblin called "The Looter in Broad Daylight".
The first adventurers were turned back, so we asked them to strike again.
I am very pleased with the results.
The monster in question is based in the "Silent Forest" and for some reason is only active during the daytime. It is easy to spot, but it is an extremely dangerous monster, so please be sure to prepare carefully.
Please help us for the future of our tourism association.
Looters in broad daylight (Silent Forest)
I am researching the "Forest Light-Yang Stone" found in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life".
However, the "Zero Area of the Tree of Life" is a sacred place for the forest people and the sample size is limited.
We would like to collect new "Forest Light-Yang Stones" if possible, but we have no contact with the forest people .......
Therefore, we would like to ask a well-faced adventurer to collect them.
Please negotiate with the forest people and collect "Forest Light-Yang Stones".
8 Forest Lamp Sunlight Stones (Zero Area of Life Tree) / ore
We are a group that aims for cultural exchange with the people of the forest.
I have heard from the forest people living in Asterleeds that they are troubled by the Sowareo okagachiyamma that appears in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life".
This monster is a nuisance that operates in the dark of night and preferentially attacks defenseless people during sleep.
We cannot afford to overlook the plight of our valued friends, the people of the forest.
It is only when we help each other that we can achieve true exchange.
Please help us take down the Sowareo okagachiyanma.
10 Sowareo okagachiyanma (Zero area of life tree)
I am a peddler in Jubilia.
After a long period of negotiations with the forest people, we were finally able to enter the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life" for a bit!
However, I ran into a matinee rumblebore there and had a terrible time. ......
Apparently, their timid nature is such that they will pounce on anything they see.
This is an opportunity to create a new peddling route, but this is not the way to go.
Defeat the matinee rumblebore!
They are hidden at night, so if you want to go after them, please do it during the day!

I'm Rasha, the lady of the Litze Mining Cooperative.
I've been having a hard time with "Flame Lapis" running rampant in "Tomdrum's Hidden Mine" lately.
They say they spread fire engrams and sometimes melt the ore, so it's not a big deal.
It's also having a negative impact on the mine's environment, and most importantly, it's dangerous.
As a person in charge of the union's wallet, I want to take action before any human or financial damage is done.
However, it's also difficult to defeat them unless you're a skilled adventurer.
You there who have confidence in your skills, I'm asking you!
◆Targets for Defeat
Flame Lapis (hidden mine in Tomdrum, free exploration)
Quan, a medicine man from Salamzart.
I have run out of medicinal herbs to prepare a concoction. I need you to gather them for me.
This herb grows only in "Götterdämmerung and Free Exploration".
It's a well-tolerated gastrointestinal medicine, and it's useful because it's something that can be used for both overeating and overdrinking.
Besides, the desert diet is highly spicy and easily upsetting to the stomach.
I like to have as much of The Manita Vine on hand as possible.
Best regards.

We are the Jeweler's Association of Asterleeds.
Can you go to the "Misty Sea Sea of Trees and Free Exploration" and collect "mixed-colored ore gemstones"?
This stone emits multiple colors depending on the light.
However, it has not been appraised as to whether it is a gemstone or just a stone that changes color due to the action of engrams.
We want to collect the real thing and clarify its value.
Finding new beautiful gems will boost our business.
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

My name is Kikifra. I'm a blacksmith in Ulrau Village.
I can forge anything from farming tools to weapons. But I can't Accept any new requests right now.
The increase in the number of monsters in the forest has caused a sudden increase in the number of requests.
Orders are piling up, but we're running out of material.
So, can you do me a favor and collect some ore?
My name is Thothoara!
Adventurers, get rid of the monsters in the "Silent Forest"!
I am very annoyed by a wild boar called Soirée Tyrant Bois!
There are many of our ancestors sleeping in the Forest of Silence, but they are disturbed by the daily violence!
I really can't tolerate them anymore!　Please do something about those guys as soon as possible!
My name is Oftoto. I was the gatekeeper of Ulrau Village.
In fact, there's one guy I've been fighting for a long time.
It is the "Dark Peeping Mouth" monster that appears in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life.
It's been in hiding for a while, but it seems to have reappeared in the forest. They are gluttonous and go around devouring all the animals and plants in the forest.
It would be a shame for me to let him stay.
Please, help us defeat "The Great Mouth that Peeps into the Darkness".
I am a rehabilia. I imitate a doctor.
The forest has been very noisy these days. More and more people are getting injured, and I use medicinal herbs a lot.
I'd like to restock before they run out, but I just remembered something that's been bothering me.
I want medicinal herbs from the "Flower Tour Tree Cluster".
It's not for injuries, but just in case. Could you do me a favor?
Do you remember an oddball named Bross who was a treasure hunter in the desert?　That's my uncle.
There was a story about seeing "The Bloodthirsty Dark Night Wolf" in that desert.
They are outrageous monsters that even adventurers are wary of.
And yet, when it comes to bros, they never stop digging holes. ......
I dragged it back for the moment, but I couldn't just leave it like that.
Adventurers, can you help us defeat the "Bloodthirsty Dark Night Wolf"?
I'm Cattleya, the trader. I've got a very interesting business opportunity for you.
I wonder if you've heard of the "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge"?
It's an antique clock made in a village in Montegnor Valley.
It is said that the dials were designed to change color as the time ticked by.
I want to revive this "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge".
What do you think?　Would you be willing to help us?
Hey Sssss, Mr. Adventurer.
Is crafting weapons a system you do?
I'm doing serious research at the Imagine Institute.
And they're pursuing hot crafts with guts?
I hear the Pioneer Bureau is also asking for help.
It doesn't hurt for adventurers to get crafty, either.
Try crafting for yourself!　You'll get hooked, seriously!
Hello. I am Poirier, an apprentice at the Imagine Institute.
It's a joint project between the Pioneer Bureau and the Imagine Institute to give adventurers a chance to try their hand at crafting Enhance Imagine.
Enhance Imagine is a must for adventure, and I want you to have a basic knowledge of the craft.
This Poirier will be in charge, so take care of it!

INFORMATION
Let's go back to the city by spatial transfer.
Spatial Transfer is a convenient feature that can Quick Cooldown travel time. <lf>You can instantly move from the command menu <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; map to the <lf>city transfer portal. <lf>First, open the map screen of the command menu.
Battle Imagine for Battle Advantage
Let's immediately equip the "Battle Imagine" you just got <lf>in the <lf>command menu <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; under "Character" &gt; "Battle Build". <lf>Battle Imagine has a variety of skills, including attack and recovery. <lf>Find the Battle Imagine that fits your battle style. <lf><lf>Once you have equipped your Battle Imagine, <lf>talk to "Myulie" at the Pioneer Station again. <lf>He will tell you how to become an adventurer.
Get ready for adventure!
This time, the expedition will take you to the edge of the "Skyquake Fields". <lf>Let's proceed by relying on the route guide and quest icons. <lf>It is also a good idea to try collecting at the collecting spots along the way. <lf><lf>There are also belligerent enemies in the field. <lf>To avoid getting hurt and falling down along the way, take out recovery medicine from the <lf>warehouse and put it in your bag. <lf>The warehouse is located at the end of the pioneering station, the girl at the asset management counter will guide you.
Let's build a weapon.
If you have the recipe from Reikrid Tunnels, you can craft <lf>a weapon by consuming materials and lunos at <lf>. <lf>Select "Weapon Crafting" in the sphere kneading ritual.
Have you used your new skills?
On the skill board in the command menu <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt;, you can check <lf>the skills you have learned. <lf>Once you have learned multiple skills, you can replace them in "Battle Build" <lf>and customize them to your liking to fight.
We got the weapon recipe.
Sometimes, such as when you complete a mission, you will get a recipe for a weapon or an Imagine from <lf>. <lf>With the recipes, you will be able to craft <lf>weapons, Battle Imagines, and Enhance Imagines. <lf>After registering as an adventurer, you can visit the "Transferring Sphere Crafting Ritual" in town.
Use of Wish List
The "Wish List" is a feature that notifies <lf>when materials are available for crafting and displays recipes on the main screen. <lf>Recipes can be added to the wish list from the crafting screen, etc., <lf>so be sure to add recipes you are interested in as you go. <lf><lf>You can also use the HUD to check the collection status at any time. <lf>Go to "Quest" &gt; "Wish List" in the command menu to display the <lf>list and check <lf>the checklist of recipes you wish to display on the HUD. <lf>Up to three lists can be displayed on the HUD at one time.
We have obtained a weapons board.
I got the recipe for the "Dragon Nail" series of weapons and the <lf>adventure board as rewards for the quest. <lf>The adventure board for weapons is an efficient way to collect materials for weapons by completing the <lf>assignments since the assignment rewards are materials for weapons. <lf>First, let's complete the assignments on the "Dragon Nail" board.
Materials for the "Dragon Claw Valley" series <lf>・Fossil of Giant Fang: reward for clearing "Dragon Claw Valley: Additional Research" <lf>・Goblin Fang: obtained by defeating goblins in "Dragon Claw Valley: Free Search" <lf>・Rings: obtained from mineral extraction points <lf>Only the fossil of Giant Fang cannot be obtained from the Adventure Board. <lf>Please go through "Dragon Claw Valley: Additional Investigations" to collect the materials.
Enemy Combination Technique
Enemies may work together in groups and use special techniques. <lf>If you see suspicious activity, make it a priority to defeat them.
Target - Attack
<span color="Action">You can attack by pressing [&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt;. <lf>(You can attack continuously by holding down the button.) <lf>When there is an Enemy nearby, press <span color="Action">【&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Lockon"/><span color="Action">】&lt;/&gt; to fix <lf>the target of the attack. <lf><lf>Use evasion <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Dodge"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; as well to fight while avoiding the attack. <lf>Avoiding <span color="Action">【&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Dodge"/><span color="Action">】&lt;/&gt; and jumping <span color="Action">【&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Jump"/><span color="Action">】&lt;/&gt; during battle consumes <lf>Stamina. <lf>Be aware that if you run out of Stamina, you will not be able to <lf>perform actions that consume Stamina.
<span color="Action">You can make your character jump <lf>with [&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Jump"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt;. <lf>Jumping consumes Stamina only during combat.
The Route Guide will guide you to your 'next destination'. <lf>While the main quest is in progress, the main quest route guide has <lf>priority. <lf><span color="Action">While pressing [&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="dash"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt;, dash to <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Move"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; and use it to follow the <lf>route guide.
If you want to view route guides for other quests, go to <lf>command menu &gt; "Quests" &gt; "Ordered Quests" and select the quest for which you want to view <lf>route guides.
<span color="Action">While pressing [&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="dash"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt;, dash to <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Move"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt;. <lf>When you are in a non-combat state, you do not use Stamina, so take advantage of it.
Tactical skills can be activated by pressing <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Skill1"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; during combat. <lf>Tactical skills that can be activated vary by class. <lf>Most skills have an "interval". <lf>During the interval, the skill cannot be used, so <lf>use your Tactical Skill at the right time.
Interacting <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; with a collection spot in the field will <lf>give you access to material items. <lf>There are various collection spots on the ground, rocks, etc. <lf>and the items that can be obtained at each spot are different. <lf><lf>Once you have collected an item, you will be able to collect it again <lf>after a certain amount of time has passed, so if you want to collect a lot of items, <lf>wait a while before visiting the spot again.
Once you have collected a spot, you will not be able to collect it for a while. <lf>After a certain amount of time has passed, or if you return to town, you may be able to collect it again. <lf> <lf>If you have exhausted the collection spots in the field, you can go back to the town <lf>.
Aegis Fighter Features
Aegis Fighter performs <lf>"Shield Guard" to hold the shield while <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; is pressed during combat. <lf>Accepting an enemy's attack during Shield Guard does not reduce HP, but <lf>instead decreases the "Shield Gauge", and when the gauge reaches 0, <lf>shield-related actions become unavailable for a while.
If you enter <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; immediately after guarding an attack, you can launch <lf>a powerful counter-slash.
Twin Striker Features
Twin Striker's <lf>"combo gauge" increases with each attack. <lf>The higher this gauge is, the more damage you can inflict. <lf>However, the gauge resets when you lose a certain amount of HP from Accepting an attack, so use <lf>evasion and HP absorption buffs to fight.
Blast Archer Features
Blast Archers can increase their <lf>"Buff Charge Gauge (BC Gauge)" and use the <lf>class action "Cure Arrow" by attacking. <lf>BC Gauge increases more when attacking a specific area of weakness or when a <lf>critical hit occurs, so depending on the situation <lf>lock-on <span color="Action">Use <lf>with or without [&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Lockon"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; depending on the situation, and attack aggressively.
Spell Caster Features
Spell Caster consumes EP and uses powerful skills. <lf>Since you can fire a series of powerful skills until you run out of EP, <lf>attack at once when the moment is right. <lf>EP is recovered by using <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; and some class skills, or after a certain amount of time in <lf>non-combat state.
Smasher Features
If the Heavy Smasher has ammunition remaining in the cartridge, it can attack with various skills by expending <lf>number of bullets. <lf>The number of bullets consumed depends on the skill. <lf>You can reload with <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; after using all bullets, but you can also reload with <lf>remaining bullets by pressing and holding <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt;. <lf><lf>Reloading with all ammunition used is a quick reload and will <lf>reload faster and with two more rounds. <lf>Manage your ammunition count and make the most of the quick reload.
transfer portal
Using the "Transfer Portals" located in various parts of the city and in the field, you can move instantly between <lf>each transfer portal by spatial transfer. <lf>You need to register your portal to use it, so when you find <lf>a new portal, register the <lf>portal at <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt;.
Transfer Portal Registration
Delivery recipients will be waiting near the transfer portals, so <lf>register any portals you have not yet registered. <lf>Portals can be used for travel within the city, and you can also return directly to <lf>each portal from outside the city, making your adventure easier.
The asset management office takes care of the adventurer's assets. <lf><lf>Warehouses can store items, weapons, costumes, etc., and <lf>can also sell items that are no longer needed. <lf>Items that are not used during the adventure, such as material items, are <lf>automatically sent to the warehouse when they are acquired. <lf><lf>You can also use "Battle Build" to change your character's equipment <lf>. <lf>Before going on an adventure, it is a good idea to stop by to organize your bag.
In the "Rush Battles" held in the Arena, winning rewards such as ability plugs that can be used to enhance <lf>weapons. <lf>Multiple difficulty levels are available, and the higher the <lf>difficulty, the better the rewards.
If there is a difficulty level you cannot complete, go to <lf>"Missions" in the command menu to complete other missions and craft <lf>new weapons. <lf>Equip yourself with a powerful weapon to make it easier to conquer.
The content allows players to compete with other players in terms of time to clear the game. <lf>Also, special rewards will be awarded for each time you beat the specified time. <lf>Let's try again and again by preparing your weapons and Enhance Imagine. <lf><lf>Time attack rankings can be found on the "Ranking Board" located at <lf>throughout the city.
At the Imagine Laboratory, you can craft <lf>Enhance Imagines (E-Imagines) and other Imagines by consuming materials and Lunos. <lf>E-Imagines can be equipped to increase parameters and also enhance the adventurer with <lf>granted abilities. <lf><lf>E-Imagines come in the form of five different symbols. <lf>The E-Imagine we are going to create is the "Three Leaves" symbol. <lf>You can equip one E-Imagine for each symbol, so when you get <lf>a new E-Imagine recipe, <lf>pay attention to the shape (symbol) of that Imagine.
When certain conditions are met on the field, <lf>"Challenge Quests" will occur and Named Enemies will appear. <lf>There are <lf>various conditions for appearance, such as continuing to hunt a specific Enemy or appearing only at night. Please try to find them. <lf><lf>Also, when you defeat Named Enemies, you may be able to obtain <lf>"Idea". <lf>Collect "Idea" and other materials to craft "Battle Imagine" <lf>and summon once powerful enemies to advance the battle.
Crafting Battle Imagine
To craft a Battle Imagine, you will need <lf>specific materials for each Imagine. <lf>First, you will need the "Idea" of that Imagine, but <lf>you may also need other materials that you can get from collecting or defeating the Imagine.
Imagine's Abilities
Crafting an Imagine may grant <lf>abilities. <lf>The effect values of the abilities that may be granted and their probability are <lf>fixed for each Imagine's abilities.
Battle Rock Wall
The battlelock wall that holds players back in the dungeon can be <lf>removed by defeating certain enemies and other conditions <lf>to proceed. <lf>If you are unable to proceed, try defeating the surrounding enemies.
Some of the player's attacks have Elements attached to them. <lf>There are six types of Element: Fire, Ice, Thunder, Earth, Light, and Dark. <lf>By stacking attacks with Element, <lf>the player can cause an attribute anomaly on the enemy.
Elemental Charge accumulation occurs each time an Enemy is hit with an Elemental Attack, and when the Elemental Charge accumulation exceeds a certain amount <lf>, the Elemental State Abnormality of the most common attribute is triggered. <lf>(Elemental Charge accumulation occurs even if the attacker hits with a different attribute.) <lf>Elemental Charge accumulation occurs in three stages: Lv1, Lv2, and Burst. <lf>The further the stage advances, the more effective it becomes.
<span color="Emphasis">Fire Element State Abnormality&lt;/&gt; <lf>At Lv 1 and 2, the user is engulfed in flames and their HP gradually decreases. <lf>When it becomes a Fire Burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and <lf>a large explosion occurs at the Burst Finish, inflicting heavy Damage Burst.
<span color="Emphasis">Ice Element State Abnormality&lt;/&gt; <lf>Lv1,2 causes the target to be covered in ice and movement speed is reduced. <lf>When in Ice Burst, the target is covered in a block of ice and cannot move when a burst occurs, and the <lf>burst finish causes the ice block to explode, inflicting heavy Damage Burst.
<span color="Emphasis">Thunder Element State Abnormality&lt;/&gt; <lf>At Lv 1 and 2, an electric current runs through the body, impeding action at a certain probability. <lf>In a lightning burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and <lf>a large explosion occurs when the burst finishes, <lf>inflicting large Damage Burst and Paralysis at the same time.
<span color="Emphasis">Earth Element State Abnormality&lt;/&gt; <lf>At Lv 1 and 2, clumps of earth cling to the body, increasing Damage Received. <lf>When it becomes an Earth Burst, it is covered in clods of earth and cannot move when a burst occurs, and the <lf>Burst Finish causes the clods to explode, inflicting heavy Damage Burst.
<span color="Emphasis">Light Element State Abnormality&lt;/&gt; <lf>At Lv 1 and 2, the player is covered in Light and the Damage Dealt is reduced. <lf>When it becomes a Light Burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, <lf>and a large explosion occurs when the burst finishes, <lf>causing large Damage Burst as well as continuous HP recovery to the surrounding players.
<span color="Emphasis">Dark Element State Abnormality&lt;/&gt; <lf>At Lv 1 and 2, Darkness clings to the user and <lf>causes the attack to miss with a certain probability. <lf>When it goes into Darkness Burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, <lf>and a large explosion occurs when the burst finishes, <lf>causing large Damage Burst and an HP leak condition at the same time.
signs of an attack
Some enemies have predictable attacks. <lf>When the predicted area of attack appears, that is where the attack will come from. <lf>Basically, focus on avoidance.
Gestures to other players
You can gesture toward <lf>other players by gesturing from the Communicate menu.
CRIME
Some walls can be climbed. <lf>To climb a wall, go up to the wall and enter <lf><span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; to hold onto the wall. <lf>Enter <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="MoveFront"/><span color="Action">]&lt;/&gt; to climb. <lf><lf>The places where you can climb are indicated by icons on the minimap. <lf>If you cannot find the way forward, try to find it.
Supplied items
During the mission, you will not be able to use items in your bag, only the supplied items that you receive from the <lf>pioneer station. <lf>Supplied items can be used in the item palette or registered in the <lf>shortcut ring. <lf>Remaining supplied items will be collected at the end of the dungeon. <lf><lf>Some missions allow you to use items in your bag.
The Engram Cannon is a legacy of Bapharia that aggregates surrounding engrams and fires them at <lf>the enemy. <lf>It is immensely effective against enemies. <lf>When glowing blue-white, it can be used for boarding. <lf>When glowing red, it is charging and cannot be used. <lf><lf>■Operation <lf>Getting in and out: <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt; <lf>Adjusting the firing direction: <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="CameraControl"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt; <lf>Firing: <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt; <lf>Be aware that you will Accept damage if attacked while boarding.
You can also receive quests from quest receptionists and people in town. <lf><lf>If you want to display route guides other than the main quest, go to <lf>"Quests" &gt; "Ordered Quests" in the command menu and check the "Show in HUD" box and the <lf>"Show Route Guide" radio button for the quest for which you want to display a guide.
Quest Exclusive Items
Quest-specific items are <lf>special items that can only be obtained during certain quest orders. <lf>They do not go into your bag or warehouse and cannot be sold. <lf>You can only see how many you have in your quest journal or HUD display. <lf>Please note that when you discard a quest, the quest-specific item will also be discarded and you will have to start collecting it all over again <lf>even if you re-accept the quest. <lf>
About Classes
In the command menu "Character" &gt; "Battle Build" you can <lf>switch to another type of weapon to equip <lf>class change. <lf>Class change can be done in the city, field, and free exploration map. <lf>(You cannot change classes while being viewed as an enemy.) <lf><lf>In addition, "Class Quests" can now be ordered. <lf>You can learn about <lf>classes with a class partner chosen for each class, so <lf>whether you are adventuring in your current class or changing classes, <lf>you should first Accept the Class Quest at the Pioneer Station.
More Content
This is the end of the main quest. <lf>From now on, please look for the various contents that exist in each area and enjoy playing at <lf>.
In addition, if you are not sure what to do, talk to the receptionist at the <lf>pioneer station. <lf>Subquests of recommended levels will lead you to <lf>new content.
How to do the gesture
You can take <lf>gestures by selecting the gesture you want to do from the talk mode <span color="Action">[&lt;/&gt; <key color="Action" action="ChatMode"/><span color="Action">] &lt;/&gt; or by calling the gesture registered in the <lf>shortcut. <lf>Communicate with other adventurers using gestures.
Enhance Imagine's equipment
Enhance Imagine increases ability values when equipped, increases resistance to debuffs through a special effect called <lf>Ability, and reduces damage from <lf>Element attacks. <lf><lf>Go to "Character" &gt; "Battle Build" in the command menu to equip <lf>"Enhance Imagine".
Enhance Imagine increases ability values when equipped, increases resistance to debuffs through a special effect called <lf>Ability, and reduces damage from <lf>Element attacks. <lf>Go to "Character" &gt; "Battle Build" in the command menu to equip <lf>"Enhance Imagine".
When the level of equipment, such as Enhance Imagine, is high, <lf>there is a possibility of "level sync" being applied to each. <lf>Level sync" on equipment means that when the equipment level is higher than the <lf>player's class level, <lf>the equipment's parameters are temporarily restricted. <lf>(E-uri Uribo will start to show its true value at class level 5) <lf><lf>If the player's class level is equal to the equipment level <lf>, the full power of the equipment will be available. <lf>When you get strong equipment but do not feel that you are getting stronger, you can try <lf>raising your class level.
The Enhance Imagine crafted this time is of a high level, so there is a possibility that it will be in a state of "level sync" when <lf>equipped. <lf>Level sync" means that when the level of the <lf>equipment is higher than the player's class level, the equipment's parameters are temporarily <lf>restricted. <lf>(E-uri Uribo will show its true value from class level 5.) If the <lf><lf>player's class level is equal to the equipment level, the full power of <lf>the equipment will be available. <lf>When you get strong equipment but do not feel that you are getting stronger, you should try <lf>raising your class level.
Enhance Imagines come in the form of five different symbols, and you can equip only one Imagine of each <lf>symbol. <lf>When you get a new recipe, <lf>pay attention to the shape of its Enhance Imagine.
Adventurer Rank Up Board

Battle tips for beginners
■Use directional derivatives of normal attacks <lf>Derivative attacks are produced by inputting the move key, etc., in conjunction with normal attacks. <lf>Each class has its own unique derivative attack, so check <lf>the skill board for more information. <lf>The vanguard class also has an attack method called "assault attack. <lf>Use it according to the situation.
■Watch the Enemy's Movement <lf>Pre-moves may occur before a powerful attack, so <lf>observe the Enemy's movement carefully. <lf>Don't just avoid it, but also aim for just evasion and <lf>try to use your guard well. <lf><lf>■ Be aware of buffs and debuffs <lf>There are various types of buffs that strengthen you and your allies and debuffs that weaken enemies <lf>. <lf>Some are powerful enough to change the battle situation, so <lf>understand the effects of each and use them to your advantage.
■ Exploit the Enemy's Weaknesses <lf>to damage it efficiently by exploiting its weak point attributes, or <lf>to generate attribute status abnormalities, using its attributes will <lf>make the battle easier. <lf>First, be aware of the Elements of your weapons, Battle Imagines, and Tactical Skills <lf>. <lf><lf>Consider when to use Battle Imagine and ULT. <lf>The longer the interval, the more effective they are and the greater the <lf>impact they can have on the battle. <lf>Use them when you have the right moment to do so.
Intermediate Battle Tips
■ Be aware of the target of the enemy <lf>When attacking or recovering, it is easy to become a target of the enemy. <lf>The vanguard should be careful that the target does not go to the rear guard, and the <lf>rear guard should be careful not to become a target. <lf>If you don't want to become a target, <lf>carefully watch the color of the enemy alert and attack when it is yellow, or <lf>reduce the frequency of your attacks.
■Check the abilities of your equipment. <lf>Check the Special Effects and Elements of your weapons and the abilities of your Imagine. <lf>The same piece of equipment may have different Special Effects and Abilities <lf>. Multiple items with the same abilities will add to the <lf>effect. Try to find and set equipment with <lf>abilities that are more appropriate for your class. <lf><lf>Try to be creative with your battle builds <lf>and set up class abilities that can help with things you are not good at, or set up battle imageries that can inflict low damage <lf>but can add abnormalities. <lf>Be aware of not only the effects of each, but also the combination of each.
■ Raise various classes <lf>When your class level reaches 30, you can use the shared ability slots <lf>to set shared class abilities of other classes. <lf>Get shared class abilities of various classes to expand the scope of <lf>battles.
Advanced Battle Tips
■Connect Chains <lf>The more chains you have in your party, the shorter the time you can <lf>connect chains. <lf>However, when the number of chains exceeds a certain number, <lf>a buff is applied to strengthen the party, so <lf>be aware of the time remaining to connect chains.
■Try to devise a battle build. 2 <lf>When attacking a mission with a party, try <lf>to create a battle build that is designed with party play in mind. <lf>You can ask other players to compensate for your weak points by <lf>abandoning defense and specializing in attack, <lf>specializing in buffing and recovery, etc. It is a good idea to make a configuration that takes advantage of your strengths and <lf>compensates for your weaknesses with your party members.
Make use of the Burst Bonus <lf>During the Burst Bonus, not only do you accumulate Elemental Charge accumulation <lf>to increase your Burst Finish Level, but also <lf>a Damage Burst Bonus multiplier is added to your Elemental Charge attacks. <lf>Element attacks with Battle Imagine will increase <lf>the bonus multiplier even more, so <lf>be proactive and aim for it.

The beaches of Asterleeds are now! <cf>It's at its best!
The beach is down the stairs. <cf>Come on, come on, come on!
Only available now! <cf>Enjoy your summer in Asterleeds!
Did you go to the beach? <cf>It's a blast. You'd be surprised!
You'll see something completely different from what you normally see.
Stairs lead down to the beach! <cf>Don't miss out on the summer fun!
Look, look, look! <cf>It's a costume I exchanged at the "Souvenir Exchange!
Pretty cute, right?　It's only for a limited time, so <cf>you should get to the "Souvenir Exchange" as soon as possible!
There's a King Collector collecting right now <cf>"Merry Red for Holy Night"!
I suggest you go to <cf>"Souvenir Exchange" because you can get gifts in exchange for what you collect!
Did you hear? <cf>The Duchy of Bernhardt was attacked by a dragon tribe.
And that's not all.
Rumor has it that <cf>the holy places of the Bapharia cult are also being attacked.
Did you hear? <cf>The story of the Duchy of Bernhardt case: ......
Not only was he attacked by the dragon tribe. <cf>They say the Lord King was assassinated. ......
Apparently the assassin escaped and hasn't been caught yet. <cf>That's a hell of a story.
The dragon tribe raids and the emergence of vicious monsters: ......
The world has become a very dangerous place, hasn't it?
Even this seemingly peaceful city can be attacked by the dragon tribe at any moment <cf>or at any time ......
You should decide on <cf>where you're going to evacuate to in case of emergency, okay?
Well, I have a boat, so <cf>if it gets bad, I'll leave land~!
From here on out, the Bapharia cult has jurisdiction.
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.
This is the garrison of the Bapharia Order of the Guard.
We are responsible for the security of the sanctuary and the surrounding area.
If you notice anything of concern or find anything suspicious, please notify the nearest guard immediately at <cf>
I ain't going to go into details, but <cf>you should stay away from the Holy Land.
Because it's a sacred place? <cf>Don't be ridiculous. That's not why I'm here.
Anyway, it's bad there. <cf>I have a feeling something ominous is going to happen in the not-too-distant future: ......
Oops, not a good idea if the captain hears about this. ...... <cf>This is the end of the story.
The goblins in this area are quite tough.
It's a group of the most skilled guards in the Order.
This is the Bapharia Asterleeds Temple. <cf>Have you come to pray to God?
The God of Bapharia is in heaven, <cf>always protecting us!
This temple was also built as the tallest building on the highest ground <cf>to be as close to God as possible!
There are not a few words that mislead people's minds these days. <cf>Remember to be thankful to God, and don't ever bend your faith.
This is the "Pillar of Divinity.
Don't go near them. <cf>If you are a believer, you should have a little more common sense.
I must say, there are a lot of tourists these days. <cf>They will not let you in without a fight, and they know where they are going.
Welcome. This is the "Pillar of Divinity. <cf>This is the most important holy place of the Bapharia religion.
Long ago, the founder of the Bapharian religion appeared here <cf>and told the people the will of the God of Bapharia.
A figure worthy of such a legend, no? <cf>You can't get that close to see the whole thing.
So, please move away a little. <cf>We don't like it when you come too close.
Welcome. <cf>How may I help you?
For quests, go to the central counter on the left. <cf>Warehouse is available at the counter on your right.
Glory coins can be exchanged at the exchange counter on the first floor. <cf>Please also use the second-floor bookshelf for research.
He showed up, that Koshimo guy. ......
...... is so restless. <cf>What's wrong with him?
I don't think that thick-skinned loan shark is going to <cf>care what people think.
Come to think of it, I don't see Koshimo's partner. <cf>Is there something going on that I don't know about ......?
What, loan shark Koshimo turned himself in to the Temple!
Oh no, why ......? <cf>No matter how hard I chased him, I couldn't get him to grab his tail.
Who in the world used what method? <cf>Please, tell me!
As an undercover agent in the Guard, I can't overlook this! <cf>I need to see that person!
What's up? <cf>First of all, I'd like to say hello to the innkeeper.
Well, wait. <cf>Let's wait until we've seen a little more of the city before we go outside.
I'm sure Feste will be all over you in the future, but <cf>well, ...... he's a hard guy to hate!
That guy tried to save you at the ruins, didn't he?
Between you and me, Feste can use <cf>blindness if he's at least one person.
Usually I use that to wind up my enemies better. <cf>But there you are, in a ruin I thought was empty.
I don't have to tell you the rest, do I?　That's what I'm talking about.
On the surface he's twisted, but basically he's a softy, <cf>that guy.
Oh, I haven't seen you around. <cf>Are you offering me a job?　Or are you taking orders?
If you want to get a job at this "Pioneer Bureau", please Accept the test at <cf>for adventurers!
Let's see, Asterleeds' pioneering bureau is ......
Oh, sorry, the pioneer station is <cf>just up the street, right?
I just arrived today from Salamzart, <cf>I don't know much about this city!
What?　Are you new in town too? <cf>What a pity.
Now, quickly Accept the exam!
If you're an adventurer, there's no better way to make a living. <cf>You can earn more money than anything else!
The Reikrid Tunnels are located in the Skyquake Fields. <cf>This is where you will be tested.
To reach the deepest part of <cf>through the old monster-infested tunnels.
I don't think it's that dangerous, but <cf>keep your eyes open. Good luck!
Hey, rookie! <cf>How you doing?
I'm the one who scouted it. <cf>Don't trip up on the registration exam, okay?
I don't see anything wrong with that! <cf>Easy work for you!
Looking forward to Success report. <cf>Good Luck!
Hey! <cf>You're going to the Reikrid Tunnels, right?
It's a long way to the back. <cf>If you think of it like "Cliffside Ruins," you'll be in trouble.
There might even be an unexpected Accident. <cf>However, it is also an adventurer's ability to deal with them.
HAHAHA! Well, don't worry. <cf>Don't worry, you can handle most things. You'll be fine!
Have you cleared "Reikrid Tunnels"? <cf>The registration exam is now Finish!
What's wrong?　You look so difficult. <cf>There was no Trouble, was there?
Now, go report to Myulie as soon as you can! <cf>Congrats to the new adventurers!
Oh, I heard. <cf>I heard you passed the registration exam for the Pioneer Bureau.
You're doing a great job. <cf>It's going to make it easier to find the memories.
There will be more excursions, and don't forget to raise your <cf>adventurer rank on the Adventure Board, okay?
That's Bapharia's legacy, too, as I recall. <cf>The more you accomplish, the better adventurer you are considered.
I heard that Jake's guy is clearing out <cf>a hell of a lot of stuff.
There are some places you can't go if you're not ranked high enough. <cf>It doesn't hurt to finally do it, so go for it.
It seems to pay well, and <cf>sometimes it's not a bad idea to venture out for the sake of the board!
Jake offered you a job? <cf>You're looking like a full-fledged adventurer now.
He is a first-class adventurer. <cf>Every job he Accepts is of a high level.
If you were invited there, that's a big deal. <cf>You must have a lot of potential.
Keep up the good work! <cf>I'll be rooting for you from the shadows.
What are you doing? <cf>The "Souvenir Exchange" is just around the corner.
What! <cf>You want to go to ...... "Dragon Claw Valley"?
And with Jake!
Gohonk ....... <cf>That's quite an honor, Kimi.
But it's pretty dangerous up there <cf>And they say there's been some crazy monsters lately.
Anyway, you need to be well prepared and <cf>take on the challenge with everything you've got!
I heard that you have been investigating "Dragon Claw Valley.
Hmm?　You don't think <cf>that it's a one and done deal, do you? That would be a waste of time.
It's such a big place with a lot of mysteries. <cf>We have to investigate over and over again to find the heritage and treasures.
That's what being an adventurer is all about. <cf>If you feel like it, go back. You'll discover something new.
This is the "Soundless City". <cf>The ruins are under the jurisdiction of the Order of Bapharia.
Sorry, no one is allowed in there for a while. <cf>I'm afraid no one will be allowed in there for a while. It's just that an unidentified monster has appeared in the back of the house.
The area has been closed off until it is safe to enter. <cf>There seems to be no sign of the monster as of late. ......
Anyway, even adventurers are no exception. <cf>For now, just stay away from them.
Up ahead is the Dragon Claw Valley. <cf>I heard there was some kind of monster out there.
It's not a situation where you can casually explore. <cf>I'm usually free to come and go as I please.
What?　You and Jake are going to team up to take down <cf>the guy?
That's helpful!　Good luck with that. <cf>Don't make the mistake of trying to do it alone, okay?
I heard that you defeated the monster that was inside.　That's amazing, Anta!
Huh?　The monster is the legendary ...... avaritia? <cf>Oh come on, you've got to be kidding.
Hmmm, but you saw it too, Jake. <cf>It's kind of an unbelievable story, though.
Oh well. Now you are free to explore again. <cf>You should come back later if you're interested.
I didn't realize that <cf>avaritia was inhabited by "Dragon Claw Valley" ......
After all, the cause of the monster turned into flux is either <cf>avaritia or ......
Oh, this is Mr. Adventurer.
Thanks to your work, what has been a mystery until now <cf>will be unraveled little by little!
Please keep up the good work!
The old man at the coin-operated pavilion said he'd buy you a drink, ze? <cf>You should go now. I mean, go. Kukuku......
Hey, good job! <cf>Looks like you're doing a great job, So good!
Have you run into any dragon people or avaritia? <cf>I've heard a lot about them since then: ......
After all, there is some movement on the part of the dragon tribe. <cf>Their behavior pattern is different from the past.
Come to think of it, the attack on the Principality of Bernhardt was also strange. <cf>I heard that the dragon tribe "retreated" to some extent.
Once you get into a fight, it's do or die. <cf>That's why the dragon tribes were such a dangerous bunch. ......
It's called avaritia and it smells really nasty. <cf>If you think it's a bad idea, you can always give me a shout.
Dr. Walken said he'd like to check out <cf>about "Giant Tower Ruins."
He's the kind of guy who acts on the spur of the moment. <cf>I didn't ask him for the details.
You can learn how to use Bapharia's heritage at <cf>, the priests of the Bapharian faith will tell you.
So the priests are learning a lot about their heritage <cf>
Well, you have to be a smart person to be a priest <cf>
It seems that many scholars who study the ruins and history of the temple have also studied at <cf>Bapharia!
Bapharia's heritage can be found in the ruins, right?
It's usually the adventurers who find it first. <cf>And once they do, they take it to the Bapharia cult.
Once they know it's safe, <cf>they'll start using it in the city and stuff.
What if the adventurers took it?
Imagine is a mysterious entity.
The crystallization of human thought and engrams. <cf>Not even Bapharia's heritage can create this.
We can awaken what is sleeping, but it is impossible to <cf>create it from scratch!
How in the world does it come into being and come out? ....... <cf>Hmmm, I don't know. It's a mystery.
Are we going to "Pillar of Divinity"? <cf>That's an interesting story.
It's not easy just to get in there. <cf>That's part of the challenge of being an adventurer.
Me? Of course!　Of course I've been in. <cf>Don't underestimate the top of the top, okay?
...... but it's only the lower level of <cf>due to a maintenance request from the Order.
The "Pillar of Divinity" is a precious "living ruin. <cf>There is no mercy for intruders. Be very careful.
Adventurer, is there anything missing?
It is precisely when you are getting accustomed to adventure that you need to be careful. <cf>The more seasoned the adventurer, the more important the preparation.
I'm not a new face anymore. <cf>You, too, must be prepared and ready for adventure.
The teacher is asking for too many conclusions at once. <cf>Even people in the past lived each day steadily.
Eating a meal, singing a song, ....... <cf>Those daily routines are history, aren't they?
They're cannons, ancient weapons, and all that kind of prominence. <cf>They're not just conveniently ruins.
The Bapharia cult is hiding something! <cf>There must be some secret that they don't want to be made public!
Otherwise, why don't you have them investigate the "Pillar of Divinity"? <cf>Why don't you let them examine the relics that are said to be in the main shrine?
If my discourse is wrong, just deny it once and for all! <cf>And yet, you harass me with your leftward shift and other such shenanigans at ......!
That is proof that my theory is in touch with the truth! <cf>I will never bend my theory!
The founder of the Bapharia religion is a visitor!　The "Giant Tower Ruins" is a cannon! <cf>Yes, it must be so!　It was decided so!
Tell your master to pick up the tab. <cf>It's just going to pile up, totally ......
Wait a minute! <cf>We can't let anyone in without a permit.
Originally, this place was only allowed in for limited <cf>ceremonies, such as the ordination of a chief priest.
So why was permission granted to you outsiders ......
How ...... are you getting in good face as an adventurer? <cf>I see that you have cleared some pretty tough obstacles.
That's a real permit for sure. <cf>Been a long time since I've seen one.
Normally, adventurers alone are not permitted to enter. <cf>In most cases, they are accompanied by a Bapharia official.
It's a rare case, but <cf>I guess it's God's will for Bapharia too!
If you have a permit, I have nothing to say. <cf>Come on in.
[It is an act to refrain from prying <cf>into those who have been allowed to enter the Mihashira.
So I will not ask any questions. <cf>Besides, the lady over there looks quite tired.
You should get some rest right away. <cf>Now hurry to Larpal.
You don't come back very often. ...... <cf>No, I meant my co-worker.
After you guys left [the Mihashira], <cf>I couldn't help but notice what was inside.
It was like something glowed above the [mihashira], but it was ....... <cf>Well, that's what God does. Nothing can be done about it.
This is the "Pillar of Divinity. This is the sacred ground of our God. <cf>Accept all events as fate.
...... please be quiet!
What about the "Mihashira"?　How was "Pillar of Divinity"?
[Did you find anything? A visitor, a memory clue, anything?
Well, if you struck out, so be it. <cf>You'll figure it out. Take your time.
A colleague I used to work with on security <cf>Tragic ......
He said he was really curious about what was going on at the [mihashira] and went up there <cf>without hearing me stop him.
It's not easy, but he was a martyr to his duty. <cf>I will continue to stand here, unashamed of him.
The last gatekeeper was a serious guy.
Hmm, you know him? <cf>I see. ...... Well, remind him from time to time.
I was told not to go, but I went into [Mihashira]. <cf>You didn't have to be that loyal to your job. ......
What, you guys are still here?
[You say, "Don't go in the mihashira," right?
All right, all right. <cf>If you've done what you had to do, get the hell out of here.
Thanks to you, my body is feeling a little better. <cf>But I can't stay resting forever.
I can't wait to go liberate Avaritia: ......
Hey, can you tell me a little bit about the chronoleap mechanism at <cf>?
Oh, I'm not trying to abuse it, okay? <cf>I'm just genuinely interested, okay?　Mm-hmm!
Yes, a little bit is fine. <cf>We trust you. See?
Gghh ......!　Don't look at me with innocent eyes. <cf>It's hard to do when you're so innocent and trusting.
Hmmm, let's see, ...... how does the chronoleap work? <cf> Of course you need a device that was in the [Mihashira]. ......
To cross space-time, a special fuel, "Chronogram" <cf>, is required!
Chronogram?
Yes, the more time you have to jump, the more you will consume. The greater the range of time to jump, the more <cf>chronograms are consumed in large quantities!
However, the chronogram is very valuable and can be found at ......
With the amount we were able to prepare, Tyris and I were able to <cf>jump in this time period!
Then, when he jumped with us, he also took us to ......
Oh, that's okay. <cf>It was only a few hours, so we didn't consume that much.
If you and Tyris could just go back to your own time, <cf>I can do the math.
Okay. <cf>By the way, how to make that chronogram or whatever [--].
Phew, it's a secret.
Damn, it's not so easy after all.
Speaking of which, why is Aerinse <cf>so worn out?
...... that device was broken <cf>energy supply source
The only way to activate it in that state is to consume the activator's own energy <cf>...... engrams
Master Aerinse must have cut his own engram to the extreme <cf>to save us!
This is a man who easily <cf>does that kind of thing without thinking about himself!
I didn't know that. ...... Well, I mean, what the heck. <cf>Give him a good night's rest.
Yes, sir. I'll give you a break, even if it costs me my life.
I've only heard rumors about it for a while. ...... <cf>I heard that "The Dragon King" has finally shown himself.
With this guy at the top, <cf>it looks like the disparate dragon tribes have come together as one.
What......? <cf>You met the Dragon King Voldigen!
Hey, man, I'm surprised you're okay. ...... <cf>You're not the kind of guy you can fight, no matter how hard you try.
Don't think badly about it, okay? <cf>Survival is an important mission of an adventurer.
But why does the founder look so <cf>sad?
Huh? <cf>What do you mean?
Look up at that statue of the founder.
You look like a mask.
I'm running a store, <cf>and it's not going so well.
I come here every day like this to pray for a prosperous business.
[If you don't have time to do that, you should be working. <cf>My wife is telling me to do that.
Is that really true? <cf>Doesn't it mean that all you have to do is work?
My girlfriend is very religious.
I'm in the middle of a prayer right now, so <cf>leave him alone.
...... God of Bapharia ...... <cf>grant us ......
I wish you a ...... peaceful ...... ...... <cf>...... stay ......
Far ...... far ...... <cf>...... light ...... tamayo!
I have lived a healthy life without serious illness until I reached this age <cf>
I believe it is because the God of Bapharia <cf>has been watching over us.
Mom, what about the "Omihashira Cookies"?
You said you'd buy it for me!
If you lie, God will punish you!
As I told you, <cf>information about Chronolipe is highly confidential.
Of course, the same applies to the "Chronogram": <cf>Please do not speak of it to anyone else!
By the way, senpai, <cf>do you think you can get the "luminous core"?
As Feste said earlier, <cf>Bapharia ruins would be the most likely place to find it.
How about visiting a place called "Valley of Machines" ...... <cf>
Anything unusual lately? <cf>Oh, ...... I heard some strange noises near the village, come to think of it.
What was that? <cf>It sounded like a creature's voice, or not. ......
Anyway, that was the most <cf>sickening sound I've ever heard: ......
Are you an adventurer? <cf>If so, why don't you go check it out?
There's a shack by a bridge nearby <cf>and on my way there I saw a weird shadow.
I was headed towards that shadow, "The Hunter's Loophole," ...... <cf>and I kind of felt really bad about it. ......
Hey, you! <cf>Be careful if you're going to explore this area!
It is said that a very tough monster has appeared in the southwestern part of the city. <cf>Rumor has it that no ordinary adventurer can stand up to them!
Traveler. Have you seen the Bapharia pilgrims?
This village is part of the pilgrimage route. <cf>It's a small village with nothing to offer, but thank goodness for that.
I thought I'd at least offer something to cheer you up. <cf>I thought I would serve you a dish with yams from around here.
I wonder if the oracle priestess will be pleased.
Oh, you guys. <cf>Did they do something to you by any chance?
The weird noises I used to hear from the mountains have stopped. <cf>It was so creepy. That's a relief.
But still, I wonder what it was. <cf>That sickening sound?　The voice?
Did you see anything in The Hunters' Loophole?
Oh, you don't have to tell me! <cf>What kind of weird monster were you anyway?
You took them down, right? <cf>Okay, that's fine then. Thank you very much.
Hey!　How was the tough monster!
Oh, you've defeated them?　That's great!
Thank God we have strong adventurers like you!
Yo, you in the same business as me? <cf>Then you better watch out.
I heard there was a tough monster in "The Hunter's Way Out." <cf>I've never seen anything like it, and it's supposedly very strong.
And I am the woman who will defeat him and make a name for herself!
...... but we're not quite ready yet. <cf>Careful, careful ......
Ahhh, I found rust on the equipment. <cf>I'll have to get you a new one.
And maybe the items aren't quite complete yet: ....... <cf>I'll have to buy more of these, too.
The monster that appeared in "The Hunter's Loophole" ....... <cf>It got knocked down.
No, no. It's good that you got knocked down. <cf>Mm-hmm.
The problem is that I took on the task of taking down the monster. <cf>If I had been prepared, it would have been over.
Let's just say I beat you to it. ...... <cf>No, but that would be ....... I have no proof. ......
I was told by adults not to go out of town. <cf>Because I could hear the monsters.
I don't hear that voice anymore ...... which means <cf>the monster has been vanquished, right?
Well, good, good, good. <cf>I'd just about run out of things to play with in the house.
The monster from "The Hunters' Loophole" has been defeated. <cf>I don't know where or who did it, but thank goodness.
It doesn't look like the adventurers hired by the village did it. <cf>So, was it done by a passing adventurer?
If you don't want to put your name forward, you can do so at ....... <cf>Are you some kind of saint who needs no fame or reward?
Or was there some circumstance? <cf>I would have loved to thank you. ......
On the northeastern edge of Asteria Plain, there is a valley called <cf>"Dragon Claw Valley".
According to mythology, this is where the dragon tribe and the Bapharia gods fought <cf>
Recently, we have heard of sightings of mysterious monsters. <cf>What on earth is going on? ......
Jake is awesome. <cf>He's like that, but when he does it, he does it.
Huh? <cf>For example, ......?
Let's see, I can't remember offhand, but ...... <cf>Well, it's just awesome!
It's another beautiful day!
The crest of the sky looks even more beautiful!
I think I'll use the portal.
Or maybe I'll walk.
I haven't been getting enough exercise lately, so it bothers me.
Hah ...... tah ......! <cf>Kk...... gwah...... hah, hah!
Hmm?　...... Don't talk to me for a second. Ha, ha, ha. <cf>of fighting dragons, ha, ha. I'm image training.
What's with that face? I know you're worried, but don't worry. <cf>We adventurers will protect this town!
Whenever I get to the point where I'm ready to go out of town, <cf>I always realize I've forgotten something.
I left my recovery pills behind. ...... <cf>I hope they're ok. ......
There aren't that many strong monsters around the city. <cf>It's okay, right?　Yeah, we'll be fine.
It's been a while since I've been to the Reikrid Tunnels. <cf>It's all but abandoned.
In the old days, there used to be a lot of good ore.
The adventurers loved the weapons I made with it. <cf>Thanks to them, I was able to make a fortune.
The latest dragon tribe to be spotted is <cf>a lowly "demi-dragon".
But don't underestimate them. <cf>No amount of adventurers can compete with them.
I fought in a war once upon a time. <cf>Do you want to see my old wounds?
I'm just kidding, in this heavenly traffic. <cf>Ha-ha-ha-ha!
This shaft connects ...... like this ...... <cf>Wow!　I didn't know it went like this!
This is going to transfer power to the wheels much more efficiently than <cf>thought possible!
Hehehe, I want to build a car when I grow up!
Sorry, we're sold out today! <cf>There was a huge line for it earlier.
What?　What was he selling?
Come back tomorrow and we'll see!
<cf>We've been doing this for 40 years. 40 years?
But they don't sell very well these days. <cf>Is it because people are losing heart?
That's why I think. <cf>Surrounded by greenery like this. ......
Take a deep breath of fresh air. <cf>See, you will feel at ease, won't you?
Spices of the world - how do you like them?
Hakusetsu Sansho and Kumari powder. <cf>There is also the popular red hot pepper!
Add a dash of flavor to your dinner stew. <cf>Happy family gathering and happy evenings!
Welcome~! Would you like to buy flowers? <cf>Flowers~...... flowers......
...... I told my dad I wanted to be a florist <cf>
But something is a little different about this place: ......
Dad's away stocking up, so <cf>I'm tending the store for him.
I'm going to be a businessman like my father someday!
It's great, man!　My dad! <cf>We're going on a big boat to Bernhardt to buy stuff.
A little late getting home this time, though.
Yo!　You want one?
What?　You know what I'm talking about. <cf>It's a circle. It's a circle.
Don't tell me you don't know? <cf>Damn. ...... Shabba's changed too.
Cheap, cheap, cheap dinnerware. <cf>It's rare Salamzart style dinnerware!
We have a large quantity in stock and are selling them at a great discount~!
...... Damn, why can't I sell it? <cf>Is the store too plain?　I'm jealous!
This is "Remiloire". <cf>It's a beauty salon for you who want to be beautiful.
What am I doing in there? <cf>...... interested?
But I'm sorry. This is an introduction only place. <cf>We can't let you in, a total stranger.
Hey!　This damn vending machine! <cf>It's broken again!
I want my 100 Lunos back!
What am I doing? <cf>I'm meeting a friend.
We're supposed to go shopping together.
There's a rumor going around lately that there's a monster out there that we've never seen before, right? <cf>That's why I've decided to go for it.
I will definitely be an adventurer!
Someday, I want to wield such a cool sword and fight for <cf>everyone!
200,000 Lunos a month or ....... <cf>The location is unquestionable. ......
Oh, what do you think? <cf>I'm planning to open a skewer shop here.
Smoke?　Well, that's going to happen. <cf>Hmmm, will it work? ......
I got some live silver sand fish at the fish market today, so I'm going to <cf>make some white divon.
Hmm ......? <cf>Isn't the red divon cheaper by 300 luunos?
This is the least of your worries today.
Aaaaahhhh, nice breeze!
Why don't you give it a try?
What do you mean you're going shopping?
If that's the case, I recommend a shopping mall. <cf>You don't have to go all over the place.
Location? <cf>Up this hill, to the right.
Weapons equipment for recovery medicine, <cf> year round deals are [--].
Yellow Roof Shopping Mall, <cf>"Yellow Roof Market"!
Just up these stairs [--].
The Yellow Roof Market, <cf>, is a shopping mall with a yellow roof!
Phew. ...... can finally take a breather. ......
I just came up from [Gaimon Plaza]. <cf>The slope, you see, is very hard. ......
It is not good if it continues for a long time, even if it is gradual. <cf>You can't win against age.
Eh?　[Is it "Gaimon Plaza"? <cf>Where is it? It's just down this central street.
As you can see, we are a divon shop. <cf>We have a variety of products from the standard to the best.
Some of the rarest items you'll ever see!
Exit?　Hey, you're doubting me? <cf>They're all legit, from reputable sources.
It's cheap, it's cheap! <cf>It's fresh fish, just caught this morning!
...... ain't selling well. <cf>I guess I got carried away and stocked up too much.
I guess I'll just have to take it with a grain of salt.
I hate it when I get old and forget things.
...... Did I give you the change? <cf>I forgot.
How do you like it? <cf>It's fresh vegetables from Minsterhorn!
Nutritious and full of nutrients! <cf>Isn't it colorful?　Delicious!
Meat and fish are good, though. <cf>I still have to eat vegetables for my health.
Don't like it. <cf>Come on, I bought it, I bought it!
This cat is always here.
I wonder if they are kept in a neighbor's house. <cf>I love it.
We can't have <cf>pets because my brother is too frail.
Hey, hey, hey, kitty. <cf>Can I come visit you from time to time?
This is Craftsman's Square. <cf>We call it "Craftsman's Square."
And there you can see the "rolling ball kneading ritual". <cf>That big guy is going to craft it for you guys.
You think it's hard? <cf>Don't be silly. It's so easy it's almost mind-boggling.
Just dump in the ingredients, pay a little luno, <cf>and you're done while I yawn!
Come on, get used to it before you learn it. <cf>Go by the training ceremony and give it a try.
......, man, what a convenient time we live in!
...... I see. <cf>The combination of this material and that material...
Was it dangerous not to mix ......
This stairway is a shortcut to [Gaimon Plaza].
I never get up there.
If you go down this slope, you will reach the harbor.
My dad works in Minato.
Today, a very important cargo arrives!
Did you know?　This tree is a gift from the Duchy of Bernhardt <cf>as a token of friendship!
Magnificent, don't you think? <cf>Strong branching, wide and deep stretched roots: ......
It seems as if <cf>embodies some country that is the leader of this planet!
Long live the Duchy of Bernhardt! <cf>Long live my homeland!
My homeowner asked me to watch the store. <cf>There's nothing to be stolen!
This is the school our children attend.
The school is run by the Bapharia religion and is open to <cf>everyone!
The teachers are also priests. <cf>They can teach us many things.
Not just the doctrines and history of the Order, <cf>but also the use of exotic languages and Bapharia heritage.
I'm sure that the Bapharia religion is spreading among the people because of these schools <cf>
I am the security for this pavilion. <cf>What is it?
Have you ...... not heard of <cf>the Ganadors?
Far from it, from the time Asterleeds was built, <cf>it's been a prominent family that has been instrumental in the city's prosperity for generations.
Let's be clear. <cf>This house is different from those common people.
If you understand, don't hang around here. <cf>If you try anything funny, I'll pull you over!
This is "Mou Tree Plaza".
That's what the tree in the middle of the square is called.
The Mou tree is also derived from the legendary priest of Bernhardt parish, <cf>Lord Mouwel, ......
It is said to be because of the 'moo~' <cf>sound it makes when the wind blows through the gaps in the trunk!
Why are these two extremes of lore still <cf>?
I'm closing up store for the day. <cf>It doesn't matter what time it is or what time it is.
I decide according to my mood of the day!
Sorry, young man. <cf>This is my reserved seat.
It's nice to drink quietly in a corner. <cf>Well, it's not bad to be lively, either.
This used to be a run-down, deserted bar. <cf>I have been sitting here since then.
It's a great place now, isn't it? It's a testament to your husband's efforts that young and old, men and women can enjoy <cf>lining up to have fun!
Mmmm, it was delicious! <cf>The meat was so tender!
I don't know many places like this, so <cf>was a great place to learn about!
Hey, let's have something sweet next time. <cf>Wanna go for a walk?
I don't know. <cf>I'm sure this place tastes great!
So, so... What are you going to do after this?
I'd still like to go somewhere if I could. <cf>Well, that is, if you're okay with it. ......
Silver sand fish is in season now.
Plus, a sunset octopus. <cf>Mushako mussels and the honey of the sea, kinkabukuro.
Gae is good dried, for daisy sashimi, <cf>Makanagi is a bit more expensive, ......
You could go with Oogori, Tonosappa, Sasibashiri, <cf>or even Nibenibe and Inaina: ......
I'm just curious. ...... <cf>What?　What?
That's the girl over there. <cf>Look, she's in the white seats on the ocean side balcony: ......
He's been glancing at me for a while now. <cf>I wonder if ...... he has a thing for me.
I'm just curious. ...... <cf>What?　What?
That guy over there. <cf>Look, he's drinking alone in the standing room: ......
He's been glancing at me for a while now. <cf>What if it's a ...... stalker?
Hey, come on in!
It's cheap!　It's delicious! <cf>One more thing, it's fresh!
Asterleeds boasts a marketplace where fish from all over the world's oceans gather. <cf>
Come by and have a look! <cf>And buy one more for yourself!
Ahhh!　It doesn't fit, it doesn't fit ...... it doesn't fit ...... it doesn't fit <cf>it doesn't fit no matter how many times I count it!
...... No, I just received a shipment from Bernhardt for a client <cf>
No matter how many times I count, the inventory and the numbers just don't add up.
I watch the boats from here every day.
He said that there is an island far away where mermaids live!
Who are you?　Who are you? <cf>And they left it all alone!
And what is this picture? <cf>I have no idea.
Oh, you, huh? <cf>You're going to clean up the mess for me?
Don't be nosy. <cf>You have to let these things take care of themselves.
I'll put up a sign or something.
welcome!
Oh, no!　Don't get the fish so close!
It smells fishy and slimy. <cf>I just can't stand it.
I'm helping out at home, so I can't just skip out. ...... <cf>Oh, how depressing!
Here you go! <cf>How about a fresh fish dish?
Fried, grilled, stewed, salads, <cf>soups, pasta, you name it!
Asterleeds specialty, specially selected seafood! <cf>We will cook it right here on the spot!
Ah, customer!　You have a nice ogori! <cf>Would you like me to handle it for you?
I have my own little bistro <cf>and I'm always stocking up here!
Not only are they fresh, but you can also find <cf>some rare fish!
Oops. There's a six-star starfish mixed in. <cf>They're inedible, but they're a lucky marker.
Maybe something good will happen today.
The crane is not working well. <cf>I asked them to fix it, but they never came.
I thought I could do something about it myself, so I went to <cf>and started pounding away at it [--].
I'm not sure what to do. <cf>I guess you have to be an expert.
I may look like this, but I used to be a sailor.
I've been to the Duchy of Bernhardt many times. <cf>And not only that. I've been to the outer continent.
A big liner is nice, but <cf>it's not a bad idea to take on the seas with only our own arms!
There are still many undiscovered lands in the world. <cf>I would be happy if young monks could find them.
What is it, indeed? <cf>You've been cancelling a lot of flights lately.
They say the dragon tribe is going to be all over the place. <cf>I guess I don't have a choice.
Thanks to this, we can't do business here. <cf>The inns that cater to sailors are deserted.
Oh, no. <cf>I hope someone gets rid of the dragon tribe.
What am I doing?　Don't you see? <cf>I'm working on the car.
This is my job. <cf>I have to feed my brother.
That girl seems to like cars and only has knowledge about them. <cf>It's pretty hard work.
If you want to craft, you can ask at <cf>down these stairs.
I saw it.
From the flower beds over there <cf>came Mr. Green Nappo.
I'm not alone. A lot of them. <cf>They marched from one to the next, and then they went away.
But people don't believe me.
Would you like to buy a vase? <cf>It's by a very famous potter.
Let me tell you something good. <cf>...... that potter is not a human being!
In fact, there is a dragon tribe disguised as ...... humans and <cf>secretly making jars. ......
I'm going to have to go to ......!　That would have been interesting. <cf>So, what do you think?　Wouldn't you be tempted to buy one?
I sell rare spices from around the world.
I walked all over the place myself, and I was a connoisseur.
Well, there were rumors of a <cf>summit meeting in Salamzart, where we were buying.
Looks like Bernhardt's Knight Commander will be there too <cf>He's probably busy fighting the dragon tribe.
Come on, come on, it's cheap! <cf>You can find all kinds of fruits from all over the world!
......Everything is an oversimplification. <cf>To a certain extent, it's all there!
...... to some extent, too much said. <cf>I think it will be a little!　...... maybe we'll get it together.
I should have looked for a bigger store. ......
The brightest star in the night sky is Atenion.
In an incarnation of the god Bapharia, who saved the earth. <cf>An honorable name was given to the star, you see.
Sometimes you just have to listen to the old stories.
You never know, you might hear something unexpected.
This hill is "Pineapple Street.
Back in the old days, during the pineapple boom, <cf>there used to be 30 specialty stores all over the place!
They put pineapple in everything: food, drinks, detergents, medicine, cosmetics, <cf>
I heard that Pineapple even took care of the store by himself. <cf>It was so great that there were rumors like that.
I don't really know what the right weapon is for me.
But when you're in a situation like that, it's best to try things out.
Get used to it instead of worrying about it! <cf>Try it, you might find something new!
Well, I don't have any money, so I'm just watching: ......
Mr. Green Nappo is your friend.
Purple Nappo-kun is a little scary, though.
Don't tease him too much, Mr. Nappo.
Up the hill is the "Pioneer Station.
Down the stairs is the "Craftsman's Square.
Come on in! <cf>We have a wide variety of rare and unique items!
I got it all the way from Salamzart! <cf>Get something for me.
Salamzart is a long way. <cf>It's through plateaus, canyons, and beyond the desert.
You should be prepared for a pretty long trip.
Sorry. This is a warehouse. <cf>My husband collects all kinds of junk.
I literally have so much to sell. <cf>Ha ha!
We have a store on Donkey Street, so please take a look. <cf>You can easily find us because our little boy is tending to the store.
Yeah, I'm a blacksmith. <cf>But I don't deal in weapons of any kind.
I refuse to retype it. Sorry.
I swore I'd never get involved in fighting again. ......
I'll never go back to the fight that took him and his daughter. ......
I hear vending machine vandalism is all the rage these days.
That's why I'm keeping such a close eye on you.
I'm not sure what to do!　My eyes are blurry. ...... <cf>I'm getting old. Oh dear.
...... you, <cf>didn't do anything to the vending machine just now, did you?
Well, let's see which one I'm going to choose. ...... <cf>Mwahhhh ......
Hmm?　What's with ......, that old man? <cf>Why's he looking at me all the time?
It's just too hard to buy.
Aster Tropical☆Mellow Shrimp Miso Flavor" <cf>I'd be embarrassed if people knew I was a secret fan. ......
I put up posters. <cf>The one I made.
Advertise your store, announce a live concert. <cf>We can take care of everything from flyers to billboards.
If you have any questions, please come directly to our studio in Asterleeds port at <cf>
Well, when I say studio, <cf>I'm just borrowing the staircase landing at the pier.
This hill is called "Donkey Street.
It is said to be named after a donkey that came and went many times <cf>with a load of goods to be unloaded at a store.
We don't see much of it anymore, though.
The docile and powerful donkey is <cf>an important friend of humans!
Phew, I did too much shopping. <cf>I thought I was just going to walk through for a bit. ......
This hill is a way out from "Gaimon Plaza" ( <cf>), but there are so many stores that I tend to wander around.
If you're in a hurry, you might as well just walk.
Blue sea ...... White waves that come and go ......
Bright beaches ...... shining parasols ......
The Light of Youth...... my lost feelings......
Oh, you cheater! <cf>Get stuffed in a tar and swept away somewhere ohohohoh!
Oh, there's oil for balloons!
My hometown, Salamzart, is famous for its many balloons floating <cf>
We use them for city lights and landmarks in the desert. <cf>There's a custom to write your wishes with them.
When your wish comes true, you release the balloon into the sky. <cf>I haven't made one of these in ages. I haven't made one in a while.
Wow, beautiful view! <cf>I've always wanted a balcony with a view of the ocean!
I'm so glad I chose this house!
Asterleeds is getting more and more people <cf>and we're going to run out of housing!
Good properties sell quickly! <cf>If you like it, there's no time to hesitate~!
I bought this house because you said it had a great view.
Where is it? <cf>You can hardly see the ocean!
When I complained, they would just shrug it off as ["]I don't care where the other houses are located["] <cf>......
Damn it, damn it!　I was cheated!
This is the main entrance to the "Asteria Opera House.
Unfortunately, there won't be any events for a while. <cf>Usually, we have the "Seirei Matsuri" (Star Festival).
I haven't heard any announcements yet this year! <cf>I'm looking forward to it too!
I can't wait to see the divas on stage!
Up this hill, you'll find the temple.
It's the biggest temple in the world! <cf>The biggest temple I've ever seen!
Don't be surprised! <cf> They say, "["]You can't hear the song that's stopped singing["]!
["]To finish the job with a normal mind at any time ["]is <cf>important. I learned that at school the other day!
That's the Asteria Plain you see across the ocean.
That crumbling tower is the ruins of Bapharia.
It's broken ...... I know, right? <cf>It's supposed to be broken, but there are pieces floating in the air.
Adventurers go to ruins like that to solve mysteries, right? <cf>It's amazing, isn't it?
It is a magnificent garden.
It is indeed a great temple of the Bapharia religion. <cf>I bet they have a lot of money.
No, no, it's fine. <cf>I'm such an impious person of little faith.
As long as the house has lights and water <cf>I would like nothing more.
Damn. ....... <cf>The guards' eyes are shining here, too.
Whoa!　What is it? <cf>I'm just an old man passing by.
I would never think <cf>foolishness to try to sneak into the temple from such a place!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!　Just go away!
This is the Temple of Bapharia. <cf>Welcome, welcome.
You may pray to your heart's content. <cf>The Temple is open to all.
Of course, there are unbelievers, but <cf>we, the Order Guards, will not let such people through!
As long as we keep an eye on them, they won't be able to get near the temple. <cf>Rest assured. Ha ha ha!
From this point forward, you are in a sacred place. <cf>Don't get too excited or make too much noise.
And of course, no business.
There is no way I would let anyone other than the <cf>church use such a delicious place where people come even if they don't say a word. ......
Gohon, gohon! <cf>Anyway, what's no good is no good!
Hey, can't we just open a stall here?
I don't think you'll have any competition here. <cf>I think you can do it.
Oh, there's something about the guard looking at me: ....... <cf>He's looking at me in a rather bad way.
What a cheapskate! <cf>The best places in town are already taken.
What?　Don't be early?
Don't get me wrong. <cf>I love the sunrises I see from here.
But your kindness has touched me.
Let me tell you something good in return.
Try going to the remote backcountry once in a while. <cf>It will surely expand your map!
You're not allowed underground.
Well, when you go down there <cf>the door is locked.
In the back of the temple are housed precious treasures and <cf>heritage of Bapharia.
Unless you have a good reason, you are not allowed to enter. <cf>Go home quietly.
I came here to see the "oracle priestess.
You are the highest-ranking member of the Bapharia faith.
She is a special priestess who receives the words of the God of Bapharia as an oracle and <cf>passes them on to us!
But such a noble person would not be <cf>in such a place. oh well...
Only one "oracle priestess" is chosen from generation to generation.
The oracle is given by God[--] and its duties can only be fulfilled by those with <cf>special powers!
Who will be chosen and how? <cf>Only God knows!
The chosen priestesses offer themselves for God, for the Order, <cf>and for the people!
This light must not be extinguished.
This is the light that was once separated from the light of hope that the God of Bapharia gave <cf>to the desolate earth!
As long as this light stays lit, <cf>we can continue to Accept God's grace!
When this light goes out, hope will also be crushed. <cf>Is that clear?　This light must not be extinguished.
It's a big temple, isn't it?　Did you know that this temple is the site of <cf>Bapharia?
This place is huge, but in the ruins, <cf>"Pillar of Divinity" is also amazing!
It's one of the largest ruins in Bahamar Highland, and <cf>it's considered a masterpiece of beauty to look at.
Anyway, I'm talking about awesome <cf>I haven't seen it yet.
...... says the sanctuary in Bapharia has been hit.
The world seems to want to wrinkle the dragon tribe. ...... <cf>Yes, they do. We get it.
I'm sure of it. They're on the move. ......
We are the only ones who know the truth. ...... <cf>You know what you need to do: ...... You know what you need to do, don't you?
...... silly, it's too early!
I can't believe they are messing with the holy land of Bapharia. ...... <cf>What are "they" thinking?
We are the only ones who are aware of the world crisis ......! <cf>What a lonely battle ......!
Is there a friend somewhere <cf>who can share this weight ......!
God in Bapharia is in heaven.
God gave the earth to us humans and <cf>himself moved beyond the sky
Do you see the "heavenly crests" that decorate the sky? <cf>That's the sign left by the god of Bapharia.
May we look up to the sky from time to time and <cf>may our hearts be filled with gratitude to God!
Sorry. We're still getting ready.
We're going to deal with Bapharia's heritage in our house. <cf>But the finished product is too expensive for me to afford.
I'm trying to sell/buy broken parts or junk parts for <cf>
I may request something from the adventurers. <cf>If so, please do me a favor.
Hey, you know what?
It's the "oracle priestess" of the Bapharia faith. <cf>She's going on a pilgrimage at this time of the year.
They say there are more and more monsters these days. <cf>The Duchy of Bernhardt has been invaded by dragon tribes, right?
I wonder if it is safe. <cf>I hope it doesn't happen often.
Welcome! <cf>What do you think?　Isn't our selection amazing?
It's so hard to collect all this fruit now. <cf>Monsters are suddenly increasing and attacking fields and stuff.
It seems that sometimes wagons get destroyed. <cf>In addition, I've been seeing bandits and thieves.
I wonder what Bapharia is doing. <cf>[They say they're going to protect the people.
One, two, three...... Okay, the numbers are right on.
It's my job to manage the purchasing. <cf>If even one number is off, it's a lot of work.
It's like any other job, isn't it? <cf>You've got to make a habit of checking every detail.
If you're missing one thing to deliver or one material you need, <cf>it's just going to be more hassle.
Mmm-hmm! <cf>It's good. I feel really good!
Food is good!　The breeze is pleasant! <cf>The Dibon will go on and on and on and on!
Mmmmmmmm! <cf>Bring me another one, with the whole taru!　I'll be right back!
What's with the transfer portal? <cf>Hmmm!　I don't like that thing.
In the old days, everyone walked on their own feet. <cf>That's why vegetables and fruits tasted so good.
Space transfers damage food, don't they? <cf>I know that!　Don't mock the elderly!
According to ...... information, this should be the site of the transaction
It's okay. They can't know we're here.
Koshimo, the loan shark. <cf>I'll grab that source of funds, sir.
Is there a "Canaroan" today?
I'm so happy. I think I'll have a double.
Hmmm, it's a sinking aroma. I can feel the northern air.
Will you please be quiet? <cf>I'm here to listen to this wonderful performance.
Sometimes it's nice to stop and <cf>listen to music.
Welcome to "Mawaru Kudarawa-tei"! <cf>Welcome to "Mawaru Kudarawa-tei"!
Would you like to have a meal?　Or would you like something to drink? <cf>Please take your time and fill your stomach!
How do you like this music? <cf>My friend's band is playing it.
Hope you like it.
Arena's on the rise.
There are lots of adventurers taking on the challenge. <cf>It's exciting to see!
The fish here is actually a better bargain than at the market.
It's a great place to be by the Arena, isn't it? <cf>I'm such a good shopper!
Oh, it's a nice breeze.
It's scenic, it's quiet. <cf>Surprisingly refreshing place, right?
Most of all, I like being able to look up at the temple.
Well, God of Bapharia. <cf>I'll do my best to take care of my husband and my son today, let me tell you.
Mmmm! <cf>It's a commemorative collection of Arena spectacles!
A limited edition platter made by Champion. <cf>I don't know why they had Champion make it.
Whatever the result, the Collector's spirit tingles! <cf>What do I do, me!
I'm here to get to the top in this Arena!
Some have made a name for themselves here, becoming Bapharia guards or joining <cf>the Order of Bernhardt.
I won't let my parents worry about me forever. <cf>I'll make it to the top, I promise!
…………
Don't talk to me. I'm trying to focus.
The next battle is going to be a tough one.
O God of Bapharia! O Athenion, incarnation of battle. <cf>Grant me strength.
<span size="Big">I've done it! &lt;/&gt;
If I don't make a mistake there ...... <cf>if I don't make a mistake there!
People say ["]never mind ["] <cf>I don't have a face to match. ......
...... No, don't be a downer. <cf>You need to brush up on your skills and try again!　This time!
This is the Arena in Asterleeds.
This whole building is part of Bapharia's heritage. <cf>That's why it's a popular spot for tourists.
My friend wanted to see it too, so I decided to show her around <cf>......
You are late. Did I get lost somewhere?
Welcome to the "Arena of Asterleeds"!
Are you a spectator?　Or a contestant?
Adventurers come here to test their skills. <cf>You too can test your strength to the fullest.
Wow, it smells so good!
The smell of a bakery is unique, isn't it? <cf>I like that about it.
Of course it tastes good, right? <cf>But smelling good makes me happy.
I got hungry when I smelled it. <cf>Which one shall I have?
The leaves are growing well.
I came to look at flowers for my house. <cf>But it might not be a bad idea to decorate with plants.
I hear there are such cultures in distant foreign countries. <cf>Bon something, wabi something, etc. ......
I don't know how hard it is, but <cf>I'll give it a try.
Nice shoes. <cf>As expected from the cutting edge of fashion, Asterleeds!
If you're going to call yourself an adventurer in this town, <cf>you're going to want to be well groomed.
I'm going to try to change the coloring of my costume too. <cf>Let's see, the dye I have on hand is ......
......!　Not even close. ...... <cf>I guess I'll have to fulfill this request first.
So this is the furnishings that came from Bernhardt.
The name of a trading city is not a given. <cf>Goods from all over the world gather in this city.
Many requests for adventurers include merchant escorts. <cf>I see. If this is how it is, it makes sense.
Welcome to Yellow Roof Market! <cf>Welcome to the Yellow Roof Market.
If you're looking for shopping, we've got you covered. <cf>We have a variety of stores here.
Please speak to our staff and we will be happy to show you around. <cf>Please take your time and enjoy!
I'm a new adventurer who came to this store, ....... <cf>I see. Zubari, you are preparing to go out of town, right?
Asteria Plain is a big place. <cf>Medicine is a necessity, especially for healing wounds.
Don't push yourself too far. <cf>You may run into some tough monsters.
Oh, sorry. <cf>This one's not for sale.
It's more like something to be disposed of. <cf>To put it bluntly, garbage.
In such a big city, there's a lot of garbage. <cf>We need jobs to collect it and throw it away.
Some things are still usable, though, and it's a waste. <cf>I want to take good care of things, don't I?
Wow!　It really is a beach!
Alright, good. <cf>Now I just need to invite my seniors to go swimming tomorrow. ......
Even the swimsuit is rather easy, I've prepared it. <cf>I'm embarrassed, but I'll do my best!
Haha ....... <cf>Otona is a carefree, floating, carefree monstrosity.
There are monsters in the sea, too. <cf>They even attack liner ships sometimes.
I can't believe they went all the way out to swim and imitate the bait. <cf>Intelligent people like me just don't get it.
The beach is guarded by <cf>guards to make sure everyone can swim safely.
There's never a monster out there.
Don't worry about what the neighbor kids say. <cf>My brother just can't swim.
Asterleeds is on the southern edge of the Magna continent.
That's why the sun is so strong. <cf>I'd appreciate a roof over my head.
I hear there are harsher climates on the outer continent <cf>, but I can't imagine what it's like!
Huh ...... Huh ...... <cf>How did you know I was there?
Huh ...... Huh ...... <cf>I'll tell you something nice as a reward.
Hmph ...... Hmph ...... <cf>Don't carelessly eat mushrooms you don't understand!
Huff ...... huff ...... <cf>I can't stop laughing for a minute now.
I'm on guard duty, keeping an eye on the beach.
Don't let anyone do anything dangerous or pollute the beach or ocean <cf>
This beautiful sea is the pride of Asterleeds. <cf>We all need to protect it.
Asterleeds became independent <cf>about 400 years ago.
At that time, it was undeveloped and there were only a few houses and fields <cf>
And now it's the largest trading city on the continent. <cf>It's kind of a crazy story, isn't it?
Hey, what's going on? <cf>Don't just stand there. Come here.
You can sit next to me, okay?
Let's forget about time and talk about it to the fullest today!
Even the casual memories we talk about here may become an Imagine <cf>and remain for posterity. Isn't that romantic?
<span size="Big">a~e～～～～♪&lt;/&gt;
What?　 <cf>I'm just practicing my singing.
<span size="Big">Swa～～～～♪&lt;/&gt;
It's a folk song from the island where I lived as a child.
<span size="Big">Rae ～～～～～♪&lt;/&gt;
Meaning?　I don't know~ It's a subhuman word~ <cf>I don't think it's goblin or Mook
Oh, no!　My yacht is gone!
Oh, no!　I hooked it up properly!
Was it washed away?　Or, no way, it was stolen!
C'mon, you yacht thief! <cf>I'll ask an adventurer to catch you!
You got the hang of fishing yet?
Do you loosen the rod in the direction of the fish?
Don't let the line break. <cf>It's important to pull the fish in!
If you are tired of adventures, how about a relaxing fishing trip here <cf>?
You can sell the fish you catch and <cf>even make a little extra money!
dead end
It's like my life. ......
I'm from rural Kanaloa and I'm here to get rich <cf>doing business.
But I'm already on ....... <cf>Sorry. Leave me alone.
If you go down these stairs, you will reach the beach!
Above you can see the pioneer station. <cf>Don't ask about other roads.
It can't be helped! <cf>This town is so complicated that even the locals get lost!
I should have looked at the map properly! <cf>Um, do you know which way was Donkey Street?
What?　What am I doing?
You can see it! <cf>I screwed up again!
Oh, my master is going to yell at me!
I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
That's the thing. ......
What was I looking for?
Ha-ha-ha-ha! <cf>Oh, no, I'm so funny~!
Let me tell you something good.
Adventurers who can do it are obsessed with Enhance Imagine.
It's not flashy, but it's definitely the secret to getting stronger.
Do your own research and master it.
I'm negotiating with this guy right now.
I'm having trouble meeting the requirements.
I think you're licking my chops just because I'm a woman.
Do you know what you're getting paid? <cf>...... Oh my god, that's not happening nowadays!
Welcome!
<span size="Big">! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, sir, ...... excuse me, <cf>you know Mr. Feste, don't you?
If you have any questions, please contact the manager directly at <cf>.
Wow, I can't handle ......, not <cf>I can't help you~~~!
This world was once ruled by God.
That was the period known as the Bapharia civilization. <cf>Ruins still remain in various parts of the country.
God then moved to heaven. <cf>He then gave the earth to mankind.
We must thank God in Bapharia and <cf>develop this earth more abundantly!
Asterleeds has grown up.
Then, too, politics is complicated. <cf>There are so many different opinions from so many different people.
Congress, Bapharia and the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>The three organizations are discussing and making policy.
Well, ...... on the surface everyone is cooperative. Yup.
There's a lot of interest, popularity, physical appearance, and so on. <cf>In that respect, the pioneering bureau is doing well.
They're all about "the equitable pursuit of the common good of all mankind." <cf>They're counting on me to be the go-between.
Nappo is a friendly, <cf>strange monster that never gets out of control.
The green one was the original kind. <cf>They got along with humans too.
And then, at some point, <cf>those dangerous purple guys started showing up.
That one is going to harm people. <cf>The green nappies seem to be annoyed with you, too.
You see Yee all over town, don't you?
They're like mascots. <cf>They're pretty amazing creatures.
I'm adjusting the flow of engrams throughout <cf>the city so that Bapharia's legacy works properly.
Well, it's a comforting sight to see. <cf>Appearances are not always what they seem!
Aww, Yee-chan is so cute!
I wish I could have one of those in my house. ...... <cf>But we can't take it home with us because it's public property in the city.
...... Ha!　I see! <cf>If you're following me from Ee's side, I'm legit ......!
I'm going to go buy some toys to distract Ee-chan for a bit, <cf>!
Do you know the Duchy of Bernhardt?
It is a military power located in the north. <cf>It's a reliable country that protects mankind from the dragon tribe.
It has long been associated with the Bapharia religion, <cf>and is also known as the "Shield of Bapharia."
As long as the Knights of that country are alive and well, <cf>society will continue to grow forever!
There's a <cf>long history between the Duchy of Bernhardt and the Bapharia religion!
I heard that the founding of the country itself was due to a special permission from the Gods of Bapharia <cf>
A nation of knights to protect the God of Bapharia! <cf>Duhhhh, that's cool, isn't it?
Bapharia is believed in all over the world. <cf>The authority of the Order is very great.
That presence of the Duchy of Bernhardt is also because <cf>the Order of Bapharia is behind it.
The Principality has been committed to the <cf>great mission of defending the Bapharia religion since its founding!
It is, so to speak, a country recognized by the gods of Bapharia. <cf>No wonder it is the largest nation on the Magna continent.
A guard of the Order of Bapharia and a knight of the Duchy of Bernhardt. <cf>Which do you think is stronger?
They hold friendlies and stuff like that every once in a while. <cf>They're both as good as each other, and they're both great.
What would happen if we really bumped into each other: ....... <cf>Frankly, I'm curious.
That said, there's no way <cf>that the Faith and the Principality will ever fight.
We are strongest because we support each other. <cf>If we were to collide, it would cause a tremendous commotion.
Did you hear?　Rumor has it that the dragon tribesmen <cf>attacked the holy place of the Bapharia religion!
It's a puny thing to do. <cf>I'm sure the Duchy of Bernhardt will not remain silent.
There are ranks of Bapharia priests.
The most senior Priest-in-Chief and the First Priest-in-Charge who assists him. <cf>The core of the Order is carried by a chosen few.
Below that are the second and third ranking priests. <cf>I, too, am a young man who has only just become a priest of the third rank.
Rank is not everything, <cf>but we still want to have the appropriate status as a sign of our faith.
Want to take a break once in a while? <cf>I recommend fishing.
It's great for playing alone or <cf>to pass the time when you're waiting for a meeting.
I think we can brag to each other about the fish we caught and <cf>it can be a great conversation starter!
This is the "Asterleeds Bridge."
As the name suggests, <cf>is a bridge over the Commercial Town Asterleeds
After passing through this cave, you will reach Bahamar Highland.
This is Minsterhorn. <cf>It's an agricultural village.
You would be surprised how quiet it is, unlike Asterleeds. <cf>I like this, the tranquility.
I moved here from Asterleeds. <cf>I like it pretty well.
...... Well, farming can be a lot of work. <cf>Especially when monsters ravage it....... Ugh!
Hey, you. Did you hear about the attack on the Duchy of Bernhardt by the <cf>dragon tribe?
Bernhardt has a strong knighthood. <cf>But even they had a hard time.
Moreover, the dragon tribe also attacked the holy places of the Bapharia religion.
What's going to happen to the world? <cf>...... all I can do is plow the fields, but I'm worried.
Do you know what avalitaire is?
It's a monster from a fairy tale! <cf>They say they are very strong and very scary!
I wonder if the monster the adults were talking about that we've never seen before is <cf>avaritia?
No one believes it, but I'm sure they do! <cf>Because he's a monster, isn't he?
Lately, the livestock have been scared of monsters. <cf>That's not a very good sign.
Livestock are sensitive. <cf>They're sensitive to the slightest change.
I ain't gonna get any good milk out of this thing if I don't keep it up.
But it's our job to do something about it! <cf>We'll deliver good milk to the world, don't worry!
Minster wheat is doing extremely well. <cf>If we don't get it right, we're going to catch too much.
If we catch too much, the price gets too low. <cf>There's a danger of price collapse.
Fortunately, Minster wheat is a specialty of this village. <cf>It's a variety that isn't produced anywhere else.
I don't think the price will collapse that much, so I guess there's no need to be too pessimistic <cf>
That big tower you see over there is the ruins of Bapharia. <cf>It's called "Giant Tower Ruins.
It's been there since I was born. <cf>My dad said it was there when he was born, too.
It's still a mystery to this day, and sometimes adventurers investigate it. <cf>A priest named Walken seems to have looked into it, too.
Well, for me, it's a big place that I can see every day. <cf>Yesterday, today, tomorrow.
There's a variety called Bitter Carrot. <cf>It's just so bitter, and it's my favorite variety. ......
What a goblin favorite this is!
Goblins come to me when I'm growing them. <cf>That's why it's forbidden to cultivate them.
I wonder if my taste buds are the same as goblins. ...... <cf>Sometimes it makes me nervous. ......
Did you know?　Minsterhorn was the name of the <cf>test farm!
A guy named Minsterhorn built <cf>a test farm named after himself.
The test farm became more famous than the village, so <cf>the village was renamed Minsterhorn.
I like it. <cf>I wish I could do something that would go down in the village's name, too.
Huh. <cf>That priest Walken is in trouble too.
When Grandpa told him about the lore from long ago, <cf>he would ask questions one after the other.
You're an odd priest to get excited about lore. <cf>You don't even look dependable. ......
But he's probably a nice guy. <cf>Because Grandpa looks happy.
Going to "Dragon Claw Valley"? <cf>Watch out for "Flux" in the back.
It looks like a normal monster, but it is strangely black with red eyes. <cf>There is something about it that gives it an odd atmosphere. ......
They're so much more <cf>ferocious than those goblins and landfoxes out there.
The "Flux" is distinguished from ordinary monsters. <cf>You'll know it when you see it.
And rumor has it that there are a ton more <cf>monsters further in. Beware.
This is the "Dragon Claw Valley" ahead. <cf>It's the ruins of Bapharia under investigation.
Now, an unidentified monster is appearing. <cf>It is dangerous to go exploring alone.
At least have a skilled adventurer accompany you.
Oh, my, did you come to pray, too? <cf>I hope it brings you good luck!
I've gained a lot of weight recently, <cf>and I thought I'd ask you to help me lose it.
[I'm not sure I can see the result if I keep asking God for help. <cf>My husband was so disgusted with me!
I came here today to ask <cf>for my husband to get fatter and fatter!　AHHHHHH!
Did you hear that?　Did you hear something big up there in the "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>?
I hope it wasn't a harbinger of bad things to come. ...... <cf>
Ha!　Maybe God is angry <cf>because I prayed for someone's misfortune ......!
Oh, my God, this is a disaster! <cf>I have to go to the shrine again and apologize to God!
Are you an adventurer? <cf>So you've come to wish me well on my journey.
Many adventurers come to Larpal to pray for safety <cf>because there are many adventurers who come to Larpal to pray for safety.
Just be careful if you're buying a good luck charm.
I heard that some merchants make people buy <cf>strange products because of their good fortune.
I think something happened on top of the "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>
Maybe there was an incident, but <cf>I'd suggest you don't stick your neck out too far down the line, man.
The "Pillar of Divinity" is a sacred place for the Bapharia cult. <cf>It is also the territory of the priests.
They're not going to be amused if an adventurer intervenes in a problem in the Holy Land. <cf>
What is it?　I'm not really interested in Bapharia <cf>
She wants to worship with me, so <cf>I have no choice but to follow her.
She's a fan of the diva. <cf>She wants to tell me how great it is. ......
I'd rather have a stylish date in the city <cf>than worshipping in the countryside like this ......
She's making a big deal <cf>about something glowing at the "Pillar of Divinity.
What happened to the lightning anyway? <cf>I don't think it's a big deal.
I'm more than ready for some rest. ...... <cf>I'm exhausted from all the walking I've done.
I'd love to have dinner alone with you in the neighborhood. <cf>We should at least do something a little date-like: ......
Hah...... divas are so nice. <cf>I wish I could be like her. ......
The Bapharians value the importance of singing. <cf>At the Star Festival, the diva sings a chant.
But my boyfriend doesn't seem to be interested in the Diva or <cf>Baphariaism.
I wonder why they don't see the appeal. ...... <cf>I'll have to be more persistent in evangelizing!
Hey, you saw it, didn't you? <cf>There was a flash of light at the Pillar of Divinity!
I also saw something fly over the top of the mountain!
And he's like, it's probably lightning or something. <cf>He won't take me seriously.
I knew this wasn't a good idea as it is. ...... <cf>We need more proselytizing.
I don't know what to say, but I'll say it again. <cf>All these worshippers these days don't know how to behave.
Worship is not about making requests. <cf>God is always watching over us.
First of all, we thank you for your peaceful and safe days and hope that <cf>will continue to watch over you!
But now all they do is make convenient wishes <cf>in the presence of God. It's absolutely lamentable. ......
You see what I'm talking about! <cf>God is angry!
I have heard it all. I heard a terrifying roar from the "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>
It is because the worshippers forgot their daily gratitude and <cf>only imposed their selfish wishes on God!
They will be punished by God for their mistakes <cf>. ......
Hello. I'm here to pray with my mom. <cf>It's a Bapharia service!　Isn't it great?
Pray to the God of Bapharia!
The God of Bapharia has gone to the sky, right? <cf>How did he go there?　It's amazing, isn't it?
I wonder if I can go to the sky someday too, like the God of Bapharia <cf>?　I'd like to go there!
Hey, hey, hey!　I saw something amazing!
Something flew over the top of the "Pillar of Divinity! <cf>It glowed, and it was really bright!
Also, there was a huge sound! <cf>A very loud, booming sound!　A loud, booming sound!
What is that?　Is it the God of Bapharia?
Here in Larpal, we can say that we are the gate town <cf>of the sacred site, "Pillar of Divinity".
See, you can see the "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>clearly from here, too, can't you?
With so many worshippers coming to <cf>it's a busy place for the size of the town.
The number of people praying <cf>is also an encouragement to us Order Guards!
What the heck. Are you too taking seriously the <cf>rumors that dragon tribes are attacking the Holy Land?
How is that possible? <cf>It's just a rumor. Larpal will be fine.
There is no way the God of Bapharia would allow such a <cf>thing!
Just a rumor. Just a rumor!
There would be no such thing as a dragon tribe attack. <cf>Even now, there are many guards like this.
The Order Guards are all very diligent. <cf>There is no way they would allow an attack.
You too should not be misled by such rumors <cf>
If others ask you about this, you can tell them <cf>it's just a rumor!
Pillar of Divinity. <cf>The entire building, including the tower, is a legacy of Bapharia.
But the statue of the founder of the Bapharia religion in front of the building ...... <cf>apparently didn't have that in the beginning!
It is said that after the Founder passed away, <cf>the people of that time expanded the building.
He must have been a very beloved person.
The "Pillar of Divinity" is very beautiful. ......
Around Larpal, you can see the "Pillar of Divinity" from anywhere but <cf>......
From here, you can't see <cf>"Pillar of Divinity" because the cliff is in the way!
I like to look at the "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>so that's a bit of a shame.
This area is the shopping district of Larpal. <cf>It's a busy shopping district for a town of its size, right?
Not only the residents of Larpal, but also those who come to worship <cf>because they visit this shopping district.
That's why we also carry a lot of <cf>products for travelers and adventurers.
You, too, might want to check out the store.
Did you hear <cf>that Berkmar was attacked a while back?
Berkmar is a <cf>settlement in the valley east of here in Larpal.
I heard a rumor that some unknown monster attacked <cf>and destroyed it.
It's a scary story. <cf>I'm too scared to sleep.
There, you see that?　Below the cliff. <cf>That's the settlement of Berkmahal.
I think it's better to call it the ruins of Bergmar. ...... <cf>It's completely abandoned.
I'm talking about the monster that showed up and turned out like that <cf>story. ......
What kind of monster shows up and wipes out an entire <cf>settlement ......?
I talked to a priestess for the first time! <cf>She was very nice. ......
She's a priestess of the oracle. <cf>She is a very important person in the Bapharia faith.
I was in Larpal with a Bapharia pilgrimage group, <cf>
If only you had come a little earlier, <cf>you would have met the priestess.
I was a little surprised when the pilgrims came out of nowhere <cf>
Normally, they don't come around this time of year.
...... I still wonder if it has something to do with that.
Look, it's Berkmar's. ....... <cf>Scary, really.
I heard that a Bapharia pilgrimage group was headed to <cf>Berkmar.
Thank you very much for your kind words.
I had relatives in Berkmar.
I hope the pilgrims will please keep me in their <cf>prayers!
The last time a pilgrim group stopped in Larpal, <cf>things were tough.
Some people were complaining about the pilgrims. <cf>Things got a little tense.
I think the cause is probably the Berkmar incident.
People are anxious. <cf>What is God doing?
What was that thing you were talking about earlier: ......?
No, there was some kind of amazing sound. <cf>Like when a big thunderbolt strikes.
The sound was in the direction of the mihashira. ...... <cf>It doesn't sound like anything out of the ordinary.
Hmmm, I must have misheard.
I told you I really saw it! <cf>I'm not lying!
For a moment, a shadow fell on the ground. ......
I looked up at the sky and saw something <cf>whizzing by at great speed!
Which way did I go? <cf>As I recall, it was the "Pillar of Divinity.
Hey there, fellas. <cf>Are you headed down the road too?
Then be careful. <cf>I heard it's quite dangerous under the cliff.
Well, so what?
You and we are both <cf>adventurers because we want to enjoy that kind of thing.
Perhaps you, too, <cf>are here to Accept the request for this mansion?
Too bad if that's the case. As for your request here, <cf>I'm one step ahead of you in Accepting it.
I get paid <cf>a ton of money for guarding the mansion!
How could I pass up such a tasty request?
Larpal is also close to "Pillar of Divinity. <cf>I thought it would be a more regal place.
But looking at the stalls like this, <cf>it looks like a pretty normal town.
Look at that. <cf>They sell cookies and wooden dolls and stuff.
...... is it a normal town or is it more like <cf>a touristy place?
Young man there. <cf>Would you like a bottle to accompany you on your journey?
Drink it or pour it. <cf>It is sure to heal any wounds in no time!
The ultimate holy water purified by the "Priestess of the Oracle". <cf>It is a precious gem that can only be purchased here.
It's a bit pricey, but definitely worth it! <cf>It is definitely worth it!
Come on, the best Larpal souvenir is <cf>these Gobashira cookies!
For a dusty, soothing wheat taste. <cf>Rich butter flavor!
You look like an ordinary cookie. <cf>They even come with the blessings of the Bapharia gods!
Not quite as good as ...... and! <cf>Delicious!
Oh, sorry. Adventurers. <cf>The store is still under preparation.
The older I get <cf>the longer it takes me to prepare.
Now, by the time the store opens, <cf>I have to close in time to get home.
...... <cf>When do I sell my goods?
You have a good selection of vegetables. <cf>Best match for my steak.
Hmm?　Adventurer. If you've earned it, <cf>I recommend the "Strongest Beef Pavilion" where I work.
Larpal's Kiraki beef is a premium brand. <cf>Everyone wants to eat it at least once before they die.
And I will serve you meat that lives up to its reputation. <cf>It's a taste worth telling your children and grandchildren about!
Is it a replacement security guard? <cf>You look like an adventurer from a pioneer station.
What, no? <cf>As you can see, we're rich.
All this thanks to generations of <cf>devotion to the God of Bapharia.
But that's why you have to hire adventurers to <cf>guard your home.
Go ahead and take a look. Our fruits and veggies are <cf>not like the rest of the land, thank goodness!
I grew up in a field overlooked by the "Pillar of Divinity," <cf>listening to the voices of divas.
And this year's crop was bountiful and tasted great! <cf>God really loved these crops!
You can cook and eat them right away or <cf>they make great souvenirs!
I'm Dr. Volker at the hospital. <cf>My kids are scared of handouts.
He's good at what he does, but he's a little rough around the edges. <cf>I'm having trouble with the pain.
Plus, those subtle jokes and guffaws. <cf>Those kids have the worst reputation in the world.
I'm honest and I don't misdiagnose, so <cf>I'd appreciate it from an adult perspective.
This is a very tense situation. <cf>Will you listen to me?
What is in the taru of this cart is milk. <cf>However, it is a month old.
They left the leftovers from the last stall piled up and <cf>left them as they were.
Is it rotten or yogurt? <cf>I still haven't worked up the courage to open ......
I don't know ...... <cf>What on earth should I do ......
My chickens ran away. <cf>As you can see, we have three of them.
I caught one bird with my right hand and one with my left hand and was about to start on <cf>the third bird when ......
You realize there's no way to beat it. <cf>I've done it ten times already.
Oh, you are an adventurer, aren't you? <cf>Welcome to Larpal, the home of the Pillar of Divinity.
This is a town where many pilgrims visit <cf>to catch a glimpse of the "Pillar of Divinity.
You've already seen it. <cf>That is great architecture that no human hand could have achieved.
It's become <cf>the most important sacred site as unquestionable proof of God's existence!
Huh, it's crowded, isn't it? <cf>It's much different from Litze!
You want to know about Litze? <cf>It's a small village in the mountains.
It's all the way east, in Montegnor Valley, <cf>along the street.
It's a fair distance, but it's a nice village. <cf>You should go there if you get the chance.
Ahead is the "Pillar of Divinity". <cf>It must be magnificent!
You see it, don't you? <cf>A magnificent statue in the shape of the founder of the Bapharia religion.
The entrance is right at the foot of that thing.
Well, most <cf>ordinary people can't get in there, though.
This area is off limits. Sorry about that.
Hah, oracle priestess ...... Suteki ......
She's the priestess who delivers the Word of the God of Bapharia. <cf>Don't tell me you don't know that!
The symbol of Bapharia, the One who is at the top of the heap! <cf>And yet so dainty and fragile, like you want to protect her. ......
Oh, how can I be like that? ......
Looks like they can't get through.
Are you from Larpal too? <cf>More and more people are using that street over there.
It's well maintained, well trafficked, and <cf>you can carry your luggage safely.
I'm really glad it's not an animal trail. <cf>Thanks to that, even an impotent person like me can come here safely.
Well, work today shooooooooo! <cf>Let's go back to Larpal.
Yo, I'm at work right now. Bouncer. <cf>Let me know if you see anything unusual, okay?
There are a lot of hot-blooded guys here. <cf>If there's any trouble, I'm here to help.
There is talk of banditry in the area. <cf>Be careful, okay?
Well, that's how I work all the time. <cf>Being a bouncer is a lot harder than you think.
Oh, welcome to Litze Village. <cf>Are you from Larpal?
Good night. <cf>Must have been tough with all the cliffs around here, right?
This leads to the Evergreen Desert. <cf>Many people stop here to rest before continuing on.
It is ...... good for the lower back. ...... <cf>Seven colors of hot water is good for old bodies. ......
Are you an adventurer? <cf>Hotel Limestone's hot springs are great. ......
Soaking in the seven-colored hot water and drinking sake with a view. <cf>It's the best luxury. ......
The hotel there is frequented by adventurers, <cf>who never tire of telling us stories of their travels!
Asterleeds, I like it. ...... It's cool. ...... <cf>It's a big city, right?　I'd love to live there. ......
At the Hoshinrei Festival, we meet people, we sing together, <cf>we look at the sea...
Boy meets girl, is that what you call it?　 <cf>I should practice my singing now!
Let's go to Asterleeds and come back big! <cf>It's been a year since I decided to go to ....... ......
There are many metalworking jobs in this village. <cf>Men and women have no problem making a living.
They process and craft metal. <cf>I hear there's quite a demand for it.
I hear people are coming in from out of town looking for work.
I'm going to work hard and make a lot of money <cf>
I'm sure there are jobs for adventurers, too. <cf>If you want money, why don't you look for one?
I'm going to be a great adventurer in the future!
So I'm going to find lots of treasures and become very rich!
Yo, there, adventurer. <cf>How about some freshly picked mountain food?
See, they are delicious mushrooms, aren't they? <cf>You can pick a lot of them in the mountains around here.
It goes well in soups, stir-fries, and everything else. <cf>They are very tasty and crunchy!
So, what do you think? <cf>I've decided to have mushrooms for dinner tonight!
Sir, would you like some woolen fabrics?
Around here, you know, the cold winds often blow into the valley to <cf>chill us out.
The wool from sheep raised in such a place is fuzzy and <cf>produces very good quality wool.
How about one for the winter? <cf>I highly recommend it.
Sir, would you like some vegetables from Montenol?
If you're an adventurer, I recommend potatoes. <cf>They last a long time, so they make a great travel companion.
But I still recommend freshly picked vegetables! <cf>Enjoy the crispy and crunchy vegetables!
Phew. That's depressing. ......
I am not good at crowds. <cf>That's why I'm often told I'm disqualified from being a peddler.
On my way to Salamzart, <cf>where I will be going, there is a lot of activity in the way of people coming and going.
Commercially, there are a lot of <cf>peddlers who commute from Asterleeds in important places. I hate it.
No, you can't. <cf>The barrier is currently closed.
I can't go into details, but it is for diplomatic reasons. <cf>It will be a while yet.
This place is at the end of the earth. <cf>This is a very important barrier.
I am proud to serve in this capacity.
Just so you know, <cf>, it's a desert area beyond the barrier.
However much of an adventurer you are, <cf>you better watch out!
To a starving monster, <cf>humans are the best feast!
Have you ever been to Salamzart?
It's just down the road, in the Evergreen Desert. <cf>It's an oasis town.
It's a totally different atmosphere than Asterleeds. <cf>I think you'll get a taste of a new culture.
How's it going?　How's life as an adventurer going?
Well, it looks like you've been to a lot of places. <cf>Quite a lot.
The world is a big place. <cf>Walk on your own feet and see for yourself.
There is a holy place called "Soundless City" ahead of us. <cf>We are the Order Guards guarding it.
But there's been a little accident. <cf>The sanctuary is in a dangerous state right now.
We, too, are forced to pull up here <cf>to work out a plan of action!
Just a few minutes ago, there was a guy who ran <cf>alone toward "Soundless City" ......
Things are kind of bad in that area right now.
I hope everything is ok. ......
That monster ...... <cf>is beyond our ability to handle.
I guess we have to abandon that place now. ......
I've just escaped with my life from a monster in the Soundless City <cf>......
Oh, I didn't run away, I just followed the ...... <cf>evacuation order. Yup.
By the way, you passed an adventurer on the way to ....... <cf>Don't tell me you were headed to "Soundless City"?
The Avaritia fiasco is over thanks to you guys. <cf>I thank you.
But we will continue to be on alert <cf>for another dangerous situation at any moment!
But "Soundless City" is a <cf>strange place, isn't it?
It used to be a city called 'Andra' <cf>It was destroyed in the war and abandoned. ......
There was a huge explosion underground not too long ago, <cf>and it's been under cult control ever since.
Apparently the cause is not well understood.
Or maybe you know but can't disclose it: ......
Oops, so much for this story.
You guys beat that thing!
You're not as great as you look!
But if we're saved by adventurers, <cf>we're going to lose our face.
I guess I'll be getting some windfalls from now on. ......
In the back here is "Soundless City."
You are ordered to remain on alert.
I'm so relieved <cf>that that young man made a successful recovery!
But still, how did they get to that place ......? <cf>Did they know the person they were dealing with was Avaritia?
In any case, that young man. <cf>He had an air of something out of the ordinary, didn't he?
Is the desert next: ......
...... Eh?　Oh, no, I'm fine! <cf>I'm not tired!
It's to save the future. <cf>I have to do my best!
Oh, man. <cf>I can't get a guarantor right away.
It used to be that checks at the barrier were so loose.
You don't have to be so tense at <cf>just because Dunkirk is here.
You're the commander of the most powerful knighthood in the world, aren't you? <cf>Even if something happens, Dunkirk-sama will take care of it.
Oh dear, ....... <cf>I wonder if the Pioneer Bureau will take on a guarantor or something?
The Duchy of Bernhardt is in some kind of trouble.
The dragon tribe attacked and the duke fell. <cf>I hear that Lord Dunkirk is practically in charge.
Even though you are the best knight, politics is not your specialty. <cf>Do you have someone to assist you?
Hey, listen!　Atashi, I made eye contact with the priestess!
What?　You don't know? <cf>The Pilgrims passed through here and entered the desert.
But, priestesses are surprisingly young. <cf>I was surprised!
Hey, he's just a kid, right? <cf>And they make me walk all over the place... It's hard work, isn't it?
If you want to go through customs, you'll need <cf>a deed of surety.
A guarantor's certificate is required. <cf>Please complete the verification process here.
We will not be able to let you through until that is done. <cf>Thank you for your understanding.
Once you get past this barrier, <cf>, you will be in the "Evergreen Desert" beyond!
If you're going, make sure you're prepared. <cf>Don't lick the desert!
Are you guys going to Salamzart?
It's nice there. It has a unique atmosphere. <cf>I travel there every year.
It is a town built in a desert oasis. <cf>The waterfront is very comfortable.
Only those who have traveled in the desert can understand that goodness. <cf>I'd love to discuss the charms of Salamzart with you too.
How's it going?　How are you?
All we need to repair the Imagine Seed is <cf>"Sap of the Spiny Mizuki".
If you look for the "Ritze Tradeway" in Montegnor Valley, you'll find it at <cf>
Hey, what are you doing? <cf>You're going across the barrier into the desert, right?
I've gone to the trouble of vouching for you, <cf>so don't waste it, okay?
I heard you went to Salamzart.
Unlike Asterleeds, there <cf>would have been all sorts of unusual stuff there.
Here, take this as a souvenir. Take it.
Oh?　You brought me a souvenir. <cf>That happens.
I'm just contributing to the economy.
You know, I'm the one who loaned you the money in the first place.
If you don't like it, you can have it back.
No silly, it's a gift from a very beautiful girl. <cf>I'll be damned if I don't accept it.
Don't talk like a creep!
Hahaha! <cf>That's what you always say.
Thanks for the Salamzart souvenirs. <cf>Just a little advice.
The ruins and caves in the Evergreen Desert are <cf>dangerous, so be careful.
In some cases, the Pioneer Bureau is giving a strong warning. <cf>If you're not good enough, don't approach them carelessly, okay?
Ah!　You guys, thank you for that time.
You'll be in Salamzart for a while, right? <cf>You should definitely come see our troupe perform!
They are all great comedians! <cf>Of course, the most popular song is mine. Heh heh.
Looking forward to it! <cf>I'm looking forward to having you all here too!
Come on by, come on by! <cf>The Jill Wett Traveling Troupe will be performing here!
The hottest diva in town, Miss Charlotte, and other <cf>skillful comedians will liven up the desert city!
A moment of rest and relaxation in a beautiful oasis! <cf>Everyone is invited to join us!
Come on, come on, come on, Zilwet Traveling Troupe! <cf>We are the Gil Wet Traveling Troupe!
Have you seen the [colored winds]?
It must have been a magnificent sight. <cf>Only Salamzart can see it so clearly.
I think it is the most beautiful in the world. <cf>[The "kosai-fu" is Salamzart's specialty.
Hey adventurer. Accepting requests to find lost children? <cf>That's what I'm talking about. ......
I saw an unfamiliar child playing with my [son]. <cf>Maybe he's a traveler or a pilgrim.
She was dressed like a shrine maiden, and her hair was pale green. <cf>A very buoyant looking girl.
The Oasis attracts both good people and bad people. <cf>I'm a little worried.
I think I just saw a priestess of the oracle <cf>I think I saw a priestess of the oracle ......
I am sure you are feeling <cf>liberated by coming to Salamzart!
I hear pilgrimages are tough and <cf>sometimes it's good to take a break.
Master Einrain must be somewhere in this city.
Whenever we take our eyes off of them, they go anywhere and everywhere. <cf>We are also having a hard time.
If you're the head of a temple, you're supposed to stay <cf>still!
So, sorry, please find Mr. Einrain at <cf>
That's the Bernhardt Knights, isn't it? <cf>They were so polite and nice.
Especially the Commander, Mr. Dunkirk! <cf>I admire his dignity.
He is so different from my husband. <cf>If I were a little younger, he wouldn't leave me alone.
Is that the rumored Knight Commander Dunkirk?
It's so great that you're representing the Lord King. <cf>He's an official representative of an official state delegation.
And to Salamzart, I'm doing you the proper justice. <cf>I'm thrilled that you came all the way out here.
What business does the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt have in the desert?
No, I know they came as an envoy. <cf>They've been in and out of ruins all over the place.
I don't know what the purpose is, but <cf>I don't think it's just a courtesy call.
What?　You met Dunkirk? <cf>Where?
Oh, oh ...... <cf>That was "Insect Fortress", wasn't it?
He saved our lives. <cf>, my servant.
What was Dunkirk doing there?
How would we know such a thing?
But you said something about a survey .......
Survey ......?
What is it?　You're really hungry, aren't you?
Oh, no, ....... Things are a bit crazy these days, aren't they? <cf>Even I'm a little concerned about it.
In addition to Salamzart's meeting, <cf>the Knight Commander personally investigated at the Bug Fort ...... or
I don't think this is related to the attack on the Principality. <cf>You've been busy.
There's a troupe of traveling entertainers here right now. <cf>You should go and see them if you like.
Jill Wett Travels, <cf>is very popular!
Ohhhh, I'm so excited. <cf>I've been waiting for this day for so long!
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! <cf>This is the time I've been waiting for!　It's finally here!
Jill Wett Traveling Troupe's performance in Salamzart! <cf>How long we have been waiting for this day!
Of course, this is who I'm looking for. <cf>Charlotte, the diva of the troupe.
That clear, beautiful voice is truly a miracle!
You should see it too. <cf>You'll regret it if you don't!
♪ Run, run, run, run, run ♪
Soon, the Jill Wett Traveling Troupe will be performing.
There's a diva who sings really well. <cf>She has a really nice voice.
Run, run lalalalalalan ♪ <cf>I want to be a diva in the future too!
You are not an adventurer around here. <cf>It must have been hard for you to come to Salamzart.
I, too, was upset when they suddenly told me <cf>that I couldn't use the pass I've been using.
Whatever, Dunkirk is coming to <cf>Salamzart.
I'm sure <cf>is a consideration so that Dunkirk is not harmed. ......
If there's a bandit out there who can put a hurt on that guy, <cf>I'd like to see him.
I've seen him fight in the Principality. <cf>No normal person could even touch something like that.
My sister's song went bwah! <cf>Thank goodness!
I would like to go to the Star Spirit Festival in Asterleeds. <cf>Someone called the Star Spirit Diva sings, right?
I wonder if a diva is a more amazing song than her sister. <cf>I'd love to hear it.
That story is boring, sister. <cf>She told the story for me.
I fell down. <cf>I almost cried because of the pain.
Then my sister came over. <cf>She even told me a story to take my mind off things!
But the story was boring. ......
Hey! You were with a nice lady earlier! <cf>What happened to them?
What, are you trying to pick up girls?
No! I didn't see any familiar faces. <cf>And I'm all about Myulie.
Hmmm... ...... yes!
Would you mind sneaking a peek at them? <cf>...... they're a lot more dangerous than they seem.
...... You have a reason, don't you?　OK! <cf>If it's a favor from you guys, of all people, I'll take it.
But where did you meet these women?
The long-haired lady's clothes are <cf>designed with a vibe I've never seen before, but ......
Oops, snooping was No. Sorry! <cf>I'll take care of the rest.
What, now you're going to Salamzart?
That's an oasis town in the Evergreen Desert. <cf>There is a lot of trade with Asterleeds.
The Exotic atmosphere of ...... will make you anticipate new adventures. <cf>Every adventurer should visit there at least once.
Help the girl who took the bait.
It's just down the road to the left!
I'm asking you!
This area is off limits to <cf>as the Knights of Bernhardt are investigating.
Under the command of the Commander of the Order, <cf>we are surveying all the sites in the vicinity.
It will take a while to complete. <cf>We apologize, but we need you to divert to another road.
This is our mission, too. <cf>We hope you will cooperate with us for the time being.
Beyond this point, the Knights of Bernhardt are investigating.
By direct order of the Commander of the Order, <cf>no one may pass.
We are aware that there is an archaeological site here. <cf>We're here to investigate them, of course.
As an adventurer, <cf>I understand your desire to enter the ruins.
Please wait until we finish our investigation. <cf>This is my job, too. Sorry about that.
Hey, where are you going? <cf>We've got to rescue the kid who took the bait first, don't we?
The site is to be investigated by the Knights of Bernhardt <cf>
Sorry, <cf>, but we're going to have to ask you to stay out of the area for now.
Hi, are you looking for Charlotte too? <cf>I'm looking forward to it!
I wish I could have been like Charlotte!
Comedy, dance, street performance, <cf>I knew this troupe was the best!
Charlotte is just down the road at the entrance to ...... town. <cf>That way, she ran away. ......
But the attackers went that way, too. <cf>Please!　Please help Charlotte!
I know because I was in the same troupe! <cf>That girl's song should not be lost in a place like this!
And yet ....... <cf>Damn, why won't it move, my leg. ......
There seems to have been some kind of commotion. <cf>The traveling entertainers were running away in a hurry.
You were being chased by a group of armed men. <cf>So many of them for one girl. ......
There are not many guards in Salamzart. <cf>They must be busy guarding the temple of Bapharia.
Here, theft and violence are solved by the adults around us. <cf>So someone has to help that kid, too. ......
I don't have long to live. <cf>The only thing left to enjoy in life was singing. ......
What a disservice. <cf>If I could, I'd do it for you.
Ancestors. ....... God of Bapharia ....... <cf>Whatever it is, may it help the boy.
You can take as much of this old body as you want <cf>......
Sure Salamzart is a bloodthirsty place, but <cf>that was crazy!
It's crazy to attack someone so brazenly in the middle of a performance!
Was there a reason to rush it that much? <cf>Or is it ......
Salamzart is getting a licking! <cf>I wonder if they think it's okay to make a scene!
I was so scared! <cf>My legs were shaking. ......
I'm an aspiring hunter, but I'm not ....... <cf>It's no good being stuck at the critical moment. ......
Hey ...... what are they doing here, those guys? <cf>What were they after?
No way, I'm one of the most ordinary guys in Salamzart <cf>Aiming at my ordinaryness ......
You were going to kidnap him and turn him into a common bandit! <cf>Oh my God!
Damn, this is not good! <cf>I should be more like a normal person and frightened!
Ummm. I can't believe they're raiding this oasis. <cf>What a hell of a thing for them to do.
It is against the code of the desert people to attack a city or an oasis. <cf>Not even wild thieves would do that.
You're dealing with someone who doesn't care about the Code or ...... <cf>would have no hesitation in killing people or worse.
What in the world would happen to a kidnapped diva? <cf>Frankly, it's frightening to even imagine.
Hey, adventurer. I have no position, no money, no power, but <cf>I need a favor from you.
Can you please help her out?　If you don't <cf>not only will she suffer, but everyone in the desert with a conscience will suffer.
That's the face of ...... the outlaw who's chasing the girl <cf>wants to know where she went!
They're running out of the oasis. <cf>Quickly, go after them!
You can't leave that girl's frightened face ...... <cf>alone!
Already!　If only you hadn't asked me to wait here <cf>I would be there!
What the hell?　Some freaky guys <cf>just ran outside after one of the girls.
Maybe it's some kind of clan festival? <cf>Maybe it's a big celebration of marriages.
...... Huh!　A raid! <cf>No, that would be bad!
Charlotte was chased by them and fled south! <cf>Please, help me ......
Please, save the girl.
We have to help, we can't. ......
Maybe there are still bandits lurking around out there. ......
...... I'll take care of it here. <cf>You guys are that girl!
I'm worried about Charlotte. ......
Please go to him as soon as possible.
Seniors, please take care of Mr. Charlotte! <cf>I will take Mr. Aerinse to a safe place [--].
I will follow up with you shortly thereafter!
Nah, what the hell happened! <cf>Oh, what the hell are those guys ......
No, it's not about that, it's Char. <cf>That girl was targeted ......!
Oh!　Adventurer! <cf>Please help our Char, please help us!
Traveling troupes are always dangerous, but <cf>I've never seen anything like this one ......
The young guys went after them, but <cf>I'm worried about that many. ......
Adventurer, can you help us? <cf>Please help Charlotte!
That girl is as good as our daughter.
Oops. Looks like there won't be any additional shows. <cf>I was relieved to hear the diva was saved.
Well, it's a traveling troupe of performers, so maybe it's inevitable. <cf>They can't stagger their performances to the next town or something.
Maybe another show in Salamzart next year or so? <cf>She had a lovely voice, so I'm looking forward to it.
She'll probably be better at it next year. <cf>That's all I can say: ......
I'm a little disappointed <cf>that we didn't get to hear your voice and song all the way through just this year.
Charlotte, ...... <cf>That girl is a guess, hands down!
Back and forth across the rough desert. <cf>I, a poor peddler, saw an angel
Charlotte is the moisture of life. <cf>An oasis in front of a dying traveler!
We'll do our best to support you at the next show. <cf>How about you join us?
After seeing a traveling performer on stage, <cf>I feel like I've just had a vivid dream.
Even the unchanged everyday life feels fresh. <cf>And the stage, too. That's what I like about it.
That's why I come here to watch them clean up like this. <cf>I like to enjoy the aftermath.
This dream got a little rough along the way, though. <cf>Hopefully next time I'll be more at ease.
I'm on the lookout <cf>for any of those guys from earlier who might be lurking around.
If Charlotte or any of her friends get attacked again, <cf>will be devastated!
Now I have to make sure I protect them. ......
Yeah, did you hear? <cf>I heard Dunkirk is coming to Asterleeds.
I mean, it's just a stopover on the road. <cf>A public visit would be a big deal.
He said he came to have dinner at "Mawaru Kudarawa-tei". <cf>That beautiful deputy commander is with them.
Damn it, why the hell is it a rudder pavilion, that son of a bitch? <cf>Why didn't he just call it a coin-operated pavilion?
However, if you came to our house, you would have been in a lot of trouble <cf>or ......
Thank you so much <cf>for helping Charlotte!
She's a very responsible girl. <cf>I hope she doesn't make assumptions about this one. ......
Hey everyone. <cf>Thank you so much for helping Char!
That girl wants to leave the troupe for a little while. <cf>That's not too much to ask after something like that. ......
If I had been more firm <cf>I wouldn't have scared that boy.
I heard. I heard that Charles was concerned about us and <cf>hid himself somewhere.
You're a silly girl. You shouldn't have bothered. <cf>You're like family.
I totally ...... want to make her want to come home early. <cf>I'll even make her favorite food!
The smell of food will bring them back. Sooner or later.
Do you know anything about you? <cf>I've seen a lot of old men around lately.
When they're praying or otherwise <cf>staring at one passerby after another.
I once asked him if he was looking for someone. <cf>He laughed sadly, shook his head, and said
["] I can't stop looking for someone who shouldn't be there ["]. <cf>What does that mean?
That guy is now left alone. <cf>He had it tough when he was younger.
I heard that he got caught doing some crazy research in "Pillar of Divinity" and was driven over here to <cf>.
What?　Who's that? <cf>The old man who comes here every day.
But still, I can't believe that <cf>thingy is going to appear in the desert like this ......
I'm ashamed to admit that I'm just not a fan of that thing. <cf>Ugh ...... I can't even imagine it!
I usually try to keep <cf>scented oil on hand to keep the thing away, not the bugs ......
Flowers are so precious in the desert. <cf>I doubt we'll get any new ones.
What do you think? <cf>Do you think you can find "The Flower of the Sand and Wind"?
I don't know how to thank you <cf>for your kindness to this old man's selfishness. ......
But you are good people indeed. <cf>Just the fact that I got to meet you made my life worth living to this day.
The place Electra mentioned: ...... <cf>"Boroum Ruins", I think.
Ruins of Sand, Path of the Wind ....... <cf>There you may find ...... "Flowers of the Sand and Wind" at ......
Defeat Avaritia, please ......
If I don't, I won't be able to continue my pilgrimage and <cf>people are anxious to see me ......
We looked around this city too. <cf>What an amazing place!
Even in this harsh environment, they are lively and <cf>everyone is full of life!
Where we live, although comfortable, <cf>was never this vibrant anywhere ......
There was a [kousai-fu] blowing a while ago, but <cf>seems to have subsided.
[Kosai-fu is a wind that blows in the desert. <cf>It is sparkling and very beautiful.
But sand will fly with it and visibility will be poor.
So when the [kosai winds] are blowing, you have to travel <cf>more carefully!
What? <cf>That in the desert, some disturbed people tried to take the girl's life?
Bandits and brigands of all kinds are everywhere, but I'm curious about the <cf>raid on a traveling performer's stage.
They're supposed to basically avoid that kind of prominence.
Some rogue organization is on the move? <cf>Thanks for the info, I'll check it out too.
Hey, here's some information that is of interest to me. <cf>More dragon tribe sightings in Evergreen Desert.
You were just over at Salamzart. <cf>Let me know if you notice anything.
And then there are those who attacked Ms. Diva. <cf>I don't see any connection between that and the dragon tribe, but ......
Anyway, be careful. <cf>You never know what's lurking around the corner.
Huh! <cf>The priestess of the Bapharia cult was a dragon tribe!
And he said he ran into Voldigen again: ....... <cf>Come on, isn't this something great?
Still, I'm glad you're safe. <cf>Hard luck, but good luck surviving!
The experience of fighting with the dragon tribe is big, isn't it? <cf>I feel like the atmosphere has become Big!
...... Electra was, the dragon people?
So ......
Dragon tribes are those who avenge God. <cf>They are the unforgivable, the incompatible.
………………
...... sometimes scared me, but <cf>I didn't hate Electra.
Have you been to the market? <cf>It's interesting, you should take a look around.
People trying to get a shot at business are opening <cf>all kinds of stores.
Not a few stores sell unusual items, <cf>which can be surprising.
Sometimes you find unexpected treasures.
Why don't you go on a treasure hunt <cf>and tour the market?
I came here today to buy some textiles.
Look at all the colorful fabrics that adorn the city. <cf>Isn't it beautiful?
I try to decorate with different colors according to the season. <cf>This kind of thing is a lot of fun, isn't it?
Now, what color should I choose next?
I wonder if there are any goats for sale anywhere.
It's my son's tenth birthday. <cf>I'm going to celebrate it in a big way.
...... Oh, and when I say celebrate with goats, <cf>I don't mean eat them!
When they reach the age of ten, they give them a goat to take care of. <cf>That's the nomadic tradition.
Salamzart is a city that was formed by the indigenous people of the desert and those who migrated from outside <cf>
There are a lot of conflicts. <cf>The Pioneer Bureau and the Bapharia religion have interceded in some cases.
It's a very difficult issue, traditions and traditions.
It depends on the situation in Bernhardt, and <cf>it's a surprisingly complicated city. Even this.
Adventurers come from across the desert, don't they?
I like it! Amazing! <cf>I wonder what's out there beyond the desert?
I'd love to go there someday too!
Did you see the <cf>ruins in that endless desert?
I don't know when, but <cf>there used to be a thriving city in that location.
According to Salamzart lore, <cf>it was a beautiful city!
I wish I could have seen it with my own eyes just once.
How about some fresh fruit?
Full of fruit juice. <cf>If you want to quench your thirst, this is the best.
You might think that fruit in the desert, but <cf>it can be harvested around here too!
This is all a blessing from Oasis. <cf>Thank God for that.
How about some exotic and unusual goods? <cf>We have clothes, jewelry and perfumes. Take a look!
Not interested?　Don't say that. <cf>You might just meet your destiny.
The ones lined up here are also ones I've found <cf>in different places.
Hey, you're an adventurer, aren't you? <cf>You're not from Salamzart, are you?
In Salamzart, we only get a little bit of rain every once in a while, <cf>
But not in other places, right? <cf>I wish I could go there too.
Also, is it true that white, cold stuff can fall <cf>?
I dream of one day traveling and seeing that cold <cf>stuff!
Well, today's sales are quite good. <cf>I guess business is all about location, after all.
This city is a good place to do business with a lot of travelers, but <cf>not all of the city is good.
Where you set up store will totally change the number of customers. <cf>You know what I mean.
That's why street vendors like us <cf>have a hard time fighting for space.
Have you eaten in this town yet?
I do business here and there, but <cf>I like the food here the best.
Nomadic lamb meat, grilled with lots of spices <cf>is just delicious!
I suggest you eat it <cf>with some thin bread made from corn flour.
In this town, strong warriors are respected. <cf>There are lots of monsters outside the city.
It's amazing who can beat that!　That's what we all think. <cf>That's why we welcome adventurers.
The next most respected are craftsmen who can make things. <cf>Clothes, carpets, glassware...
My parents are merchants, so this is how I help them. <cf>I hope to be a cloth weaver someday.
This is the Temple of Bapharia.
Salamzart has its own unique belief in the worship of ancestral spirits. <cf>But it is still the Bapharia faith that has the most followers.
We, the priests, will also be praying <cf>to the best of our ability for the believers who visit!
But there aren't too many priests. ...... <cf>It's a long way from the Holy Land. ......
Oh, sorry. It's nothing. <cf>Please don't worry about it!
I go to this Bapharia temple <cf>every day to pray!
If you pray every day, <cf>the sky god will hear you.
But I would also like to pay a visit to the big temple or <cf>"Pillar of Divinity" someday!
It must be a very divine place ......
I hear more and more stories about seeing dragon tribes and things like that.
Asterleeds or Bernhardt, but if <cf>this city is attacked, it would be a disaster!
Buru Buru...... please don't let the dragon tribe come near you!
This is a pretty interesting city. <cf>Outside the city is all sand in the desert. ......
That's why there are so many things to see in the city. <cf>This scenery is also interesting and different from other towns, isn't it?
There's plenty of food for the adventurers! <cf>Don't forget to show up at the Pioneer Station!
Hello. Are you an adventurer? <cf>Are you new to Salamzart?
This Salamzart is centered around a <cf>oasis on the edge of the Evergreen Desert!
It's the halfway point on the <cf>trade route between Asterleeds and the Duchy of Bernhardt.
That makes it easy for people to get together. <cf>There are many adventurers and merchants.
I'm sure you can get all kinds of things. <cf>Go ahead, browse the stores.
Besides, I'm sure there are many <cf>who would like to lend a hand to the adventurers.
Hey, hey. <cf>With your wish to be rich when you grow up.
Which do you think is easier to fulfill, the wish to be a strong warrior when you grow up or <cf>?
I want to put either of my wishes in the balloon. <cf>But I can't make both of them come true at once, can I?
Which wish should I put in my wish list: ......
Are you a traveling adventurer? <cf>Have you been to the falls yet?
You can get splashed around the waterfall, <cf>it's the coolest place in town!
It's truly an oasis!
But it's a place for everyone to use. <cf>It's against the law to bathe directly in the water.
Are you a traveling adventurer? <cf>Let me tell you something about the Salamzart way.
Don't even think about stealing in this city.
You say it's like that in other towns?　Maybe so, but <cf>it's especially bad in this town.
If you're caught stealing, you'll get the sack <cf>from the townsfolk who are there. Remember that.
Are you a traveler?　This city is interesting. <cf>Look at that balloon.
Balloons are going up all over the city, and <cf>wishes are being made on them!
When you have a wish, you write it on a stone and <cf>put it in a balloon with your offering.
And if your wish comes true, you're supposed to cut the <cf>balloon string!
I still deal in a lot of different products, but <cf>my dream is to deal in some of the most exquisite jewelry.
Salamzart has a lot of gemstone craftsmanship. <cf>Save your money and have an extraordinary craftsman.
I want to open a big jewelry store. <cf>As a centerpiece, I'm going to display a necklace with a huge gemstone.
Well, we haven't found the gold yet, we haven't found the craftsman yet, and we haven't found <cf>the big gems yet.
Adventurer, how about this fabric? <cf>If you want clothes, I can tailor them for you.
It's made of crystalline silk, a specialty here in Salamzart. <cf>How do you like it?　Isn't it beautiful?　It feels so good against your skin.
And this color scheme! <cf>Isn't it a beauty you won't find anywhere else?
You want to look around somewhere else?　Too bad. <cf>Our cloth is the best!
Adventurers? <cf>The sun must be hard to beat in this city.
In addition, it's this hot!　I'm used to it, but <cf>it gets much cooler at night!
And before you think it's too hard, you should take a proper rest in the shade. <cf>It's Salamzart's way of spending his time.
Phew, water tastes good. <cf>Oh well, I can finally rest.
Ouch. My back hurts. ...... <cf>Desert travel is becoming more bearable. ......
I'm used to it, but <cf>desert travel is still hard.
We're traveling with heavy packs, chugging limited water, <cf>scared of the coming sand storms.
When I see Salamzart across the street, <cf>I'm so relieved from the bottom of my heart.
The water in the oasis appears to sparkle as it bounces off the light. <cf>I really think it's like a jewel.
Hey there, adventurer!　Aren't you tired?
This is Salamzart's resting place. <cf>It is literally an oasis for everyone!
I won't take Luno away from you. <cf>Rest to your heart's content!
Oh yeah, and don't get carried away and go into the water. <cf>We don't want you to drink the adventurer's broth!
Have you ever heard of "whispering cliffs"?
I went there the other day with a buddy to test my mettle. <cf>That's a scary place ......
It was as if I could hear <cf>the cold Whispering Cliffs ...... from under the high cliffs.
Ho, it's true!　I had a feeling I heard ......! <cf>You be careful if you're going too!
Wow, wow! <cf>Are you an adventurer?
You know what? I've never been out of town, so I don't <cf>know what it's like out there.
So, I've been wondering, <cf>I want to ask you something: ......
Is it true that outside of the city, there are <cf>ulibos bigger than mountains, hovering around!
Gah!　Is it a lie? <cf>Dad cheated me again. ......
Oh, you've come to visit again. All right, all right.
There are many hunters around here. <cf>Get to safety before they find you.
I see now that you are not a horned goat, but an adventurer. <cf>I've been making mistakes a lot lately. Please don't be offended.
Mr. Guido is a strange man. <cf>I heard he's a detective. ......
Every time I see him, he asks ["[,] something's going on, isn't it? ["]] he asks me at <cf>.
There hasn't been a single incident. <cf>I wonder if they don't have jobs.
Don't detectives usually show up at <cf>after a case has been made?
There's an old saying in Salamzart, <cf>that says, 'Tomorrow has a song for tomorrow.'
If not today, there is always tomorrow. <cf>Opportunities are not infinite, but they always come every day.
It's a shame that today's failures hurt you so much that <cf>you won't be able to sing tomorrow's song.
Yesterday is yesterday, today is today, tomorrow is tomorrow. <cf>Make sure you love each new day properly.
You think our tent has a plain pattern. <cf>It used to be much more flashy.
It had my face embroidered all over it. <cf>It makes your heart shiver just thinking about it, doesn't it?
But I've been getting complaints from all over <cf>that kids cry when they see the tent. ......
Now it's just a safe pattern. <cf>I guess my sex appeal is too strong for children. Ha ha ha!
Welcome! <cf>This is the Imagine Institute.
Don't underestimate it as a desert laboratory! <cf>The facilities are all state-of-the-art!
...... Well, every city is up-to-date.
Hello. It's another beautiful day for crafts.
This is Salamzart's artisan square. <cf>You are free to use the kneading rituals.
Evergreen Desert is <cf>a desert, and the monster life is unique.
Get your hands on some rare materials and <cf>craft some new weapons!
I've never been to Salamzart before. <cf>It's a very nice city indeed!
The food is good!　People are jolly! <cf>The climate is dry and easy to understand!
It's like this town was made for me! <cf>I've decided to make this my base of operations!
I've been concentrating on my craft and now I'm hungry. <cf>I think it's time to get something to eat.
Since we've come all the way to Salamzart, <cf>I'd like to try some of their specialties!
I believe Salamzart was famous for its meat dishes. <cf>Meat after craft!　Yeah, maybe it's not so bad!
I went to "Insect Fortress" in Akatsuki. <cf>It's still a creepy place no matter how many times I see it.
Insect Fortress" is a huge insect nest in the east. <cf>Monsters that look like insects are everywhere.
Unless you're quite the bug lover, <cf>I don't think it's a cozy dungeon.
Do you know what "Boroum Ruins" is?
I can't even find Bapharia's heritage, <cf>It's a very unremarkable site.
The wind that blows through the ruins has a mysterious power <cf>that sometimes produces miraculous treasures!
But I hear it's a pretty rare phenomenon, so <cf>it's a bone of contention to go into the ruins for the treasure.
I've been going there for about five years now, and the results are ...... <cf>Hey, what the heck!　What's wrong with being romantic?
I was attacked by bandits, but a hunter saved me. <cf>The hunters in this town are very strong.
I think I'll quit being an adventurer and become a hunter too!
Hey brother!　How you doing? <cf>This is Salamzart's settlement office.
It looks very different from the other buildings in town, doesn't it? <cf>Many adventurers don't even know it's a pioneer station.
That's why I'm standing here at <cf>to guide you through them.
If you want to get the job, go inside and go to ......, <cf>I guess I don't need to explain myself there. Good luck, bro!
The kids were running toward the pioneer station and I was admiring <cf>thinking they were reading a book or something and then I saw ......
He went straight into the back of the tent. <cf>Oh dear.
It's probably some bad kids' <cf>hidden playground anyway.
Well, the best thing for a child in the desert is to be cheerful. <cf>Bad boys and pranks are all fine and dandy!　Ha-ha-ha!
In this city, we appreciate rumblebores. <cf>Because in the desert rumblebores dig in the sand.
It's an action to find a vein of water in shallow water. <cf>Those guys can't survive without water.
Maybe it's because he's got a good nose. <cf>He finds the water veins well.
So the rumblebore is a beast that brings water. <cf>If you hunt it, you get both fur and meat. It's a bargain creature.
Go east through the Evergreen Desert and you will see a cliff. <cf>In the center of the cliff is a place called "Hermit's Fountain.
There is a recluse living in the "Fountain of [Hermit]'s [Izumi]" ....... <cf>It is said that a recluse lives in "The Hermit's Fountain" ().
It is a place that even locals seldom go near. <cf>Some people go there occasionally, but their purpose is to ......
It's a lovers' meeting.
This city is too open. <cf>It's hard to find places like that.
I may look like this, but I used to be popular.
When I was an active hunter, all I had to do was kill a sand viper and <cf>yellow screams would echo through the air!
In this city, warriors and hunters are especially respected. <cf>Now, adventurers are also respected as fighters.
Is that me now? <cf>...... I wish I'd gotten married back then.
Sand vipers are monsters that have nowhere to throw away. <cf>They can be eaten if you remove the poison, and the poison has its uses.
Moreover, the poison can be denatured if pickled in certain herbs. <cf>The denatured poison is used as a tonic, and it's delicious.
The skin is also resistant to drying, tough and hard. <cf>It is used for belts and boots!
It is even called the blessing of the desert. <cf>Of course, be careful of the poison when hunting.
Light Flowers, Sand Wind Flowers, Moon Flowers ....... <cf>They're all beautiful flowers said to be found in the desert.
The desert is a harsh environment for people. <cf>If we're even a little careless, we could lose our lives.
So, at least let the flowers <cf>bloom as strong and beautiful as the desert!
That thought is making beautiful flowers bloom in the desert. <cf>I can't believe ......
Hmmm, nice color. That's my dyed cloth. <cf>It's getting more and more textured with exposure to the sun.
How's it going?　Adventurers. I'm sure the pioneer stations in other cities <cf>don't have such magnificent tents!
What, not a tent to begin with? <cf>A whole stone or wooden building?　What?
You can afford such luxury! <cf>People in other parts of the country are so strange!
Nappo is very energetic in this hot weather.
There's a colossus in Salamzart, too. <cf>Those girls, they come out everywhere.
Sometimes they dry up and roll their eyes.
Throw him in an oasis and he's back to normal. <cf>I'm impressed with you, man.
Look and see!　Ee-chan's stuffed animal. <cf>Isn't he cute?
My dad bought it for me at Asterleeds. <cf>It's my treasure.
The oracle priestess is the most important person in the Bapharia religion.
Only priestesses can hear the voice of God. It's a wonder~.
I wonder if the god of Bapharia is a good singer too? <cf>I wonder if the priestesses would tell me if I asked them?
What's with the difficult face? <cf>You're a customer service representative, aren't you?　There, I laughed, I laughed!
Just a thought. <cf>I've got a lot on my mind, too.
I don't know what happened, but if you look like that <cf>you're not going to get any customers.
Please, smile for me. <cf>I'm the one who will be in trouble if this place goes under!
Hey!　I'm the one in trouble. <cf>...... What the hell is wrong with you?
Welcome to ......!　Welcome!　Welcome!　 <cf>Glad to be here!　Welcome back to ......
It's ...... different. I wish there was something like this, a <cf>phrase unique to the coin-tei.
I'll see if I can talk to Jake about it: ......
Hey, Master. Take me with you. <cf>I know you're in trouble, and now is the time to return the favor to my master!
Thanks, but we'll save that for later.
No, but [--].
I don't think now is the time, Carvein. <cf>We can only go so far, I'm sure.
Right?
Mm. In case of emergencies, <cf>you should brush up on your skills.
...... York is right?
I understand. But if you need me, just let me know. <cf>I'll be there to help you.
Hey, you, <cf>, what's up with this pendant?
I think it's a clue from my parents: ....... <cf>They were holding them when they were picked up.
I'm an orphan. I've been through a lot, but since the <cf>troupe took me in, I've been happy.
But still, when I see that pendant, I feel <cf>that I had a mom and dad and ......
You may have become a diva: ......
...... simple, but if I become famous <cf>I'll get to meet my mom and dad, you know?
Such an important thing, okay?
Such a precious thing, okay?
You guys have helped me twice. <cf>If this is how I can repay you, I'm happy too!
Please help Mr. Aerinse.
What is it about "oracles" that suddenly ......, <cf> just pops into your head?
...... because I was 'made' to.
Was ......?
But lately it's been strange. <cf>...... more than one, like there are
......Nothing. I only deliver the oracle.
Oh, oh?　Good luck. <cf>Sometimes, I have questions I want to ask you.
...... Which is the real deal, Carvein or York?
......?　Both are dear friends. <cf>They are both very kind and ......
I see. A pattern of being too nice and not seeing them as the opposite sex.
Good?　Always be sensitive to people's love affairs. <cf>You never know when something might become a bargaining chip.
See, just like Jake from the other day, right?
...... I just wanted to know if you simply wanted to know...
Hohoho!　That's exactly right!　 <cf>There's nothing more interesting than hearing about someone else's escapades!
I can't seem to help my mentor now. ......
Someday, I will definitely return the favor! <cf>When that time comes, don't hesitate to count on me.
If my pendant helps, go ahead and use it.
...... I was just following the oracle
Just ......, if you guys can help.
I thought I would work a little harder than usual.
I, like all of you, <cf>will do what I need to do now!
We have a lot of things to discuss, and <cf>let's set up a time to talk somewhere!
Take care. <cf>Good luck to all of you in your fight.
I never thought this would happen, you know. ......
What? I mean Bernhardt. <cf>I can't believe that the Lord King was assassinated. ......
But I'm sure the Knight Commander, Master Dunkirk, <cf>will do something about it.
Do you know?　Rumor has it that the murderer of the Lord Kings is fleeing to <cf>this way.
I'm sure there's a nice bounty on <cf>if we catch him!
That's what I'm talking about, living happily ever after for my grandchildren.
Well, I'd be surprised if it's true!
Rumor has it that the assassin of Duke Bernhardt, <cf>is a member of the Order of the Knights.
Dunkirk-sama won't be able to do it!
The death of the Prince means that <cf>it's still a state funeral.
How late in the year do they usually open?
I may look like this, <cf>but I have a bit of a connection to the Duchy of Bernhardt.
So I figured I should attend the state funeral. <cf>Ohohoho ......
I heard the assassin is holed up in the Asteria region <cf>
It would be a disaster if they suspect we are harboring them or something. <cf>If this triggers a war, ......
I still can't believe that the great King Norbert is no longer with us <cf>I still can't believe it ......
But we have to accept it. ......
Perhaps the Knight Commander Dunkirk will be at the helm of <cf>my homeland for a while.
I hear he is a bright man with a good family background. <cf>I am sure he will serve you well.
Wow, the number of loads still doesn't match!
Oh no. It's a Bernhardt Order thing, so <cf>different numbers can be a pretty big problem.
Lately, the luggage bound for the Duchy of Bernhardt has been <cf>Bapharia's legacy is so much more than that.
It's all about the weight of the load, and we have to get it right. <cf>Ah, more annoying work!
I never thought the Duchy of Bernhardt would be <cf>like that ......
It used to be a good country. ...... <cf>I'm a sailor and I've been there many times.
The Bernhardt souvenirs were all of good quality and <cf>were appreciated by everyone......
Even at my age, I'm still a connoisseur, walking around the world on my own <cf>feet. ......
Let's stop going towards Bernhardt for a while <cr>. <cf>Until things calm down.
It's another beautiful day, but ...... <cf>I just can't seem to clear my mind.
There have been a lot of scary incidents lately. ......
Hmm?　...... Don't talk to me for a second. Huh, huh, <cf>I'm catching an assassin, ha, I'm image training.
What's with that face? I know you're worried, but don't worry. <cf>We adventurers will protect this town!
What?　Supplier? <cf>It's Bernhardt. ......
Don't worry. Dad will be home soon.
If it was just the dragons, <cf>Bernhardt would be in that mess too, right?
Oh, no. <cf>Somebody's got to do something about this.
...... says Lord King Bernhardt has been hit.
The world has decided that it was committed by our relatives. <cf>Yes, we do. We'll know.
We are the only ones who know the truth. ...... <cf>You know what you have to do ......, don't you?
How could they suddenly kill the Lord King? ...... <cf>What are they thinking?
It's the "Priestess of the Oracle" of the Bapharia faith. <cf>It seems she had a meeting with Lord Dunkirk in Salamzart.
When he came back, he said he had an important ceremony this time <cf>and locked himself in the temple.
I don't feel comfortable with this whole King Bernhardt thing. <cf>I feel like something bad is about to happen.
I've seen a lot of that lately.
Where can I find ......? <cf>Let's see, ...... various places!
...... A boy in quirky white clothes?
Yeah, I saw that one behind the Arena <cf>I don't know if he's still there or not ......
...... Merlouf? <cf>I've never heard of such a name. ......
Features are available at ......?
Whitish quirky clothes, light purple hair ...... <cf>Age is early teens ......
Oh, by the way, I've heard that such a one <cf>often shows up in the Arena.
Mr. Dunkirk ...... I wonder if he was that scary.
I saw you in town and <cf>you didn't look very approachable ......
My whole body was filled with an air of ["]stay away ["]. <cf>You used to be so friendly and kind.
Oh no, I'm choking up.
The Bernhardt Knights were here the other day. <cf>It was tense, very inaccessible.
I know the country is in trouble. <cf>I hope you don't get us involved too.
My little girl, she's stuck at home.
I've been looking forward to it for a long time <cf>because Master Dunkirk, the man of my dreams, is coming ......
When I called out to him, he gave me a big stare!
I don't know if he's the greatest knight or what, but <cf>he's a terrible man!　I can't believe it!
Mr. Adventurer!　Did they get him?
That's the one, that's the one! <cf>The assassin on the loose or something!
It's scary, isn't it? <cf>I hope he's not hiding in this village.
I heard that Master Dunkirk was in Salamzart.
Something about a meeting among the great ones.
I hear it wasn't a very good vibe.
Lord Dunkirk did a horrible thing.
I hope the Bapharia gods don't get their bees knees.
There's a lot of noise going on these days," he said.
I wish Berkmar and I wish Bernhardt and I <cf>had a little more peace of mind.
Everyone prays to the mihashira every day.
Asterleeds was a little rowdy.
I'm talking about an assassin or something, <cf>, who may be on the run.
That's all I've been doing lately. <cf>I wish I could just relax and grow vegetables.
I was hoping to go on a trip for the first time in a while.
Asterleeds' liner has stopped.
I don't know the details of the situation, but <cf>it's not a peaceful one.
Have you ever heard of the Kingdom of Drava?
It's a country that predates the Duchy of Bernhardt. <cf>The duchy has an institute that dates back to that time.
Drava Royal Research Institute". <cf>It is an old facility that is still in use today.
The head temple of the Bapharia religion is in the Principality of Bernhardt.
The temple in Asterleeds is fine, but <cf>history is older in Bernhardt parish.
I'm told that the research facilities for Bapharia's heritage are better over there at <cf>
In the Bapharia diocese of Bernhardt, there is a facility called <cf>"Drava Royal Research Institute"
It's a place where they do research on Bapharia's heritage and technology. <cf>They also work with the Duchy of Bernhardt!
That's why the Order has its own equipment.
Hey! How are you doing?
What am I doing here?
My dad asked me to stay at his place. <cf>You're a real jerk, you know that?
Well, now that I'm in charge, I'd better do it right. <cf>Welcome. Welcome to the "Two-Faced Coin Pavilion.
Do you want to have a meal?　Or do you want something to drink?
Make yourself at home. <cf>This is the Oasis for adventurers.
Now that I've been entrusted with the Coin Pavilion's absence, <cf>I can't afford to be lax about it.
I've been reviewing the books for starters, <cf>and this one is confusing as hell!
The handwriting is dirty and the lines are distorted. ...... Oh, it's unforgivable!
The typeface is Clear and the border is Straight! <cf>Everything is being rewritten from scratch!
In the name of top of the top, <cf>I'm not going to cheat even one luino!
The "Sanctuary of Blessings" is a sanctuary originally reserved for oracle priestesses and other <cf>limited visitors.
But you are special. <cf>Because by oracle, you have asked God for his power.
For us, the oracle is absolute.
The oracle priestess who receives and delivers it is the <cf>symbol of the Bapharia religion!
God will watch over us. <cf>The oracle priestess will tell us that
Please hurry to the "Sanctuary of Blessings". <cf>May God bless you all.
To go to the "Sanctuary of Blessings", please use the spatial transfer portal located in the basement at <cf>
This spatial transfer portal leads to <cf>"[Sanctuary of Blessings]".
Please use it.
The entrance is at the end of this boundary
Please, remove the monster inside: ......
All I can do is watch from here.
Please follow the oracle and guide us to <cf>
Thanks to you, <cf>, the monster that was undermining the cathedral has been removed!
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Leave it to the <cf>priestesses to take care of the [mitsuka] of God!
This spatial transfer portal leads to the temple of Asterleeds at <cf>
To get back here, please use the portal at the Temple of Asterleeds at <cf>
This spatial transfer portal leads to the Principality of Bernhardt at <cf>
However, it is currently not available due to various reasons
God's [Mishka] Messenger," ...... or
The priestesses say it is God's will. <cf>Can we just put it away with words like that ......?
I heard that shortly after the messenger showed up <cf>, Bernhardt's researcher came to you.
I haven't heard much good about that country lately. <cf>I think things are getting a little sketchy.
Oops, this is between us. <cf>I don't want to end up like Mr. Walken.
Thanks to all of you, we were able to successfully set up the warding on <cf>"God's [mitsuka] messenger"!
The [mitsuka]i was being investigated by <cf>the duchy's research institute at the request of the Diocese of Bernhardt.
There was no subsequent report and ......
With the assassination of the Lord King and the Dragon Tribe showing up, <cf>it may not be the best time to do so!
[--]I can't help complaining to you guys. <cf>My apologies.
We may need your help again at <cf>
Please do me a favor then.
I thought that as long as I could free the Avaritia, <cf>everything would be fine!
I can't believe that's what happened: ......
The impact of the avaritia shell is immeasurable, <cf>and the Dragon King Voldigen is somewhere lurking in the background ......
In the midst of all this, we have to find a way to save Tyris and save the future <cf>from the ground up again!
What will happen to us <cf>in the future? ......
[Thank you for calming my heart.
If we get this close <cf>we can hold the rest ......
......[Mitsuka]，I don't know why or where it came from!
If you should know, God will tell you. ...... <cf>If not, then you don't need to.
Damn ......! <cf>The guards' eyes are shining here, too. Damn!
Hmm?　What the hell are you doing? <cf>I haven't done anything yet!
Oh, no, I'm not going to do anything to the temple. <cf>I'm talking about the ...... and the people I know!
Just get on with it and go away!
Are you going to "The Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon"? <cf>Indeed, there have been reports of avaritia sightings nearby.
However, people rarely visit, so <cf>the church is not taking any action beyond surveillance!
The location is in the southern part of Montegnor Valley. <cf>It is part of the "Abandoned Galley Ridge Road".
We have heard that the monsters in the area are also ferocious. <cf>Please be careful.
Welcome to our website. <cf>Please pray for us here.
May your daily prayers bring you <cf>God bless you!
Mr. Einrain is at ......
I heard there were quite a few injured. Some of them died. ......
What is the Principality thinking?
This is a lie, of course!
I can't believe they would attack a holy place. <cf>Oh, how horrible!
God of Bapharia, ...... <cf>forgive us foolish mortals!
The Order says it helped the assassins: ......
You're not going to attack us for this, are you?
What's going on in the Temple?
What's going to happen to the Order now?
I'm sure Master Lugerio will take care of it.
He is a man of exceptional <cf>ascendancy, unparalleled in Bapharia's history.
It must be all right to leave it to that person!
This is unprecedented, isn't it?
If what the principality says is true: ......
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow ...... what to do ...... ka-chan!
The portal to Bernhardt in the Sanctuary of Blessings is <cf>The blockade has been completed.
But it is a temporary solution. <cf>Is there any drastic solution?
<span size="Big">We need to arrange a ship as soon as possible! &lt;/&gt;
Send a messenger to check on the situation. <cf>If things continue as they are, this could turn into a war!
Security request for adventurers, additional doctors and medicines. <cf>Contact the Pioneer Bureau!
I'm sorry to be so early in my assignment, but could you please send a status report to the "Diocese of Salamzart" at <cf>
That one is also under Lugerio's control, so we can ask for help at <cf>
It would be better if you could contact the "Diocese of Bernhardt" side from there <cf>......
The Khartoum Ruins are the remains of an ancient city located in the center of <cf>the Evergreen Desert.
From Salamzart, take the "Old Rainfall Road" to <cf>east and you will find it on high ground!
It used to be the central city of that region and home to the <cf>cult.
It is a place with which we are very familiar. <cf>It is an ancient and traditional site in Bapharia.
In any case, gather accurate information. <cf>In parallel, contact the Principality of Bernhardt.
If we were to lose the oracle priestess in addition to the main temple, <cf>the very existence of the Order would be at stake!
Any way you can. <cf>Contact the right person as soon as possible!
Huh?　Long time no see. <cf>How is your adventure going?
I'm going to be doing some research around here for a while. <cf>I heard about some interesting ruins!
He said that maybe the ruins are from a time period older than the Bapharia civilization <cf>!
You have no choice but to look into this! <cf>I can't wait to see what we find!
What a surprise! <cf>Our oracle priestess is ......!
The deeds of the Duchy of Bernhardt are against God. <cf>They will be punished by the gods soon.
Priestess of the oracle. Please be safe. <cf>We never cease to pray to the gods.
ぐぬぬぬぬ……！ <cf>Yeah, you hard-headed gatekeepers!
He insisted that I could not enter the "Pillar of Divinity! <cf>I never thought you would be that afraid of me revealing the truth about the visitors!
When it comes to this, I'm not going to choose my means. ......
I will write a detailed account of the treatment I have Accepted from the Order and bury it at <cf>this place!
Decades or centuries from now, someone who follows in my footsteps will dig up <cf>this letter!
That's when the <cf>truth that the cult has been hiding will come to light!　Justice will prevail!
And the meanness of the gatekeepers!　And the meanness of the priests! <cf>We'll bury everything here and leave it behind!
Ha ha ha! <cf>It's too late for regrets!
The door is shut tight.
Due to an emergency situation, this area is currently closed.
Carvein and Charlotte should be in <cf>"Kartoum Sandway" ......
I hope there's nothing to ...... but ......
In order to rescue Ms. Einrain, we must go to <cf>the Principality of Bernhardt!
I can't help you in any way, but you can contact me at ....... <cf>I'm sure Jake would be familiar with the situation.
I am concerned about Tyris, <cf>but I am even more concerned about Einrain!
Please, please help them.
How's it going?　Did you find the sailors?
In this day and age, we need to get into Bernhardt. <cf>I need someone with a hot Spirit!
When you're all here, come back here. <cf>We'll be ready to sail, Hurry up!
What do you think?　Did you hear anything useful?
I've asked a lot of people too, <cf>but as I said, I don't know how to sneak into a castle.
While we're doing this, <cf>Carvein and Einlein are ......
Let's hurry. Whatever it is, <cf>we need to find some leads!
Hey! Did you hear anything useful?
It's going to take a little longer on my end. <cf>Keep listening to what the villagers have to say.
Hi, welcome! <cf>I'm Dairitensch, Jake's friend!
Coin-operated pavilion, I'll make you die! <cf>Oh, Okininis, you're gonna rattle me, aren't you?
What's wrong?　You say you don't like the way I look?
Nononon!　This is Saisin! <cf>Bad Guy Fashon!
It is a sturdy door. <cf>It is impossible to open it by force.
The key is hidden in the "Alston Abandoned Mine", you said in your letter to <cf>.　Here we go.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
We can't leave Jake and Charlotte behind.
I'm Andy.
I've known Jake for a long time, <cf>and I've heard a lot about you guys.
That's a pretty good story, isn't it? <cf>It's pretty rare for Jake to admit that, you know?
I look forward to working with you in the future!
So much for greetings. <cf>Now we have to carry the rest of the people left on the trading ship.
Can we reach Bernhardt Castle?
As far as I know, most of the royal palaces and other important buildings <cf>have corridors that are only used in case of emergency.
A secret route that ostensibly will not be available: ....... <cf>May exist in Bernhardt Castle.
Of course, you won't be able to enter easily. <cf>We would need to find a key or something somewhere.
<span size="Big">Oh, Kanaloa!　My hometown! &lt;/&gt;
Look at this open road! <cf>I'm not the one standing at a dead end anymore.
I got a good offer right away. <cf>They asked me if I would make use of my experience at Asterleeds!
There are things you can know because you've fallen behind. <cf>They say only a man like that can be asked to do the job.
If all goes well, they'll offer me another job. <cf>Well, that's a good start!
I couldn't have done it without you guys! <cf>My life is not over yet!
I hope Einrain is safe and sound: ......
I hear that Mr. Carvein is also a prisoner. <cf>Stories of public executions are reaching us here as well.
Those people are innocent. <cf>Please help them as soon as possible.
I wish I could understand you and Dunkirk and Veronica through <cf>words. ......
Are you done with your errands? <cf>I'm done sending guys to Bernhardt who want to cross over.
[--] So you were contacted through that route.
The seal on the letter is authentic. <cf>The route of entry into the castle appears to have been secured.
Once His Majesty is here, <cf>we should be able to enter with impunity.
Hurry. Quickly and carefully. <cf>Continue to make arrangements.
But still ...... why did the Principality of Bernhardt <cf>suddenly turn against the Order?
I have only good things to say about Mr. Dunkirk's reputation. <cf>He is a reasonable and honorable knight. ......
I just can't believe you are the one to cause this <cf>without a reason!
Can we hear the truth from Mr. Dunkirk's mouth <cf>......
It's good that the distribution has been released, but.... <cf>I have a lot of work to do!
Oh no, I'm going to collapse from overwork!
It's you, isn't it? <cf>You're the one who took down Dunkirk with Carvein.
I'm really proud of you, man!
He was said to be the strongest knight of mankind. <cf>I can't believe he beat that Dunkirk!
Well, I've known for a while that he's not just a guy, you know!
I had no idea that Master Dunkirk was the one who started the <cf>rebellion!
But I heard that Master Hugo was deceived. <cf>I'm relieved it wasn't premeditated.
The King of Kings is willing to listen to the people's opinions directly to <cf>
I came all the way to the castle.
Initiatives that have never been taken by the monarchy before are <cf>very good, but ......
It's not easy to get my turn, so I'm just dabbling here at <cf>
Well, at one point I wondered what was going to happen.
I'm glad Mr. Norbert is back: ......
I know that you have been granted permission to enter the castle by the High King.
Try not to hang around too much.
Listen to me!
I heard that the Lord King has announced <cf>that he will listen to the opinions of the people at large.
I think I'll go to <cf>castle for a while too!
There has been a lot of noise in the Order. <cf>There seems to be some major movement going on.
I heard that you have made contact with the Duchy of Bernhardt. ....... <cf>We may soon have a resolution.
Just ...... is this all over? <cf>I'm just kind of feeling a bit nervous about it. ......
Until you all return safely, <cf>we can't let up yet!
Peace returned to the temple. <cf>Oh, God!　We thank you.
This is another test brought by the God of Bapharia. <cf>We were one, and we overcame it.
I hear that more and more people are neglecting their daily prayers these days. <cf>This may be God's condemnation of mankind.
We must not forget to thank God. <cf>Once again, it would be good to pray
What?　Shopping?
Yeah, I've been thinking. I've been thinking about something.
I'm thinking about getting some new weapons together.
Because of what happened with Carvein and Einlein. <cf>I felt like I wasn't strong enough right now.
I want to have the strength to protect my loved ones like you do. <cf>I want to be strong against the odds.
It's not something that can be changed by weapons alone, though. <cf>It's just a starting point.
So far, it's been to protect ourselves from monsters, but <cf>we may be fighting a different enemy down the road.
I need to be prepared for when that happens. <cf>I kind of have a feeling about that.
Hey! Looks like Bernhardt's case is settled.
Ostensibly a major figure in Carvein, <cf>I'm well aware of your exploits, Ze!
Those who understand can understand. <cf>So get it off your chest, okay?
I've got a lot of work to do at the store. <cf>I don't think I'll be able to show up at the pioneer station for a while.
You're here, you'll be fine. <cf>Tell everyone I said hello.
You can tell Myulie that, and tell me about Master Jake's great success at <cf>, okay?　Nah?
I've been through a lot. ...... <cf>Thanks for helping me out.
York, and for more information about Dunkirk, visit ....... <cf>............
If you say that was God's will, too, ...... I am ......
But ............
...... Carvein is worried about you. <cf>Give him a shout if you'd like.
I'll be fine. <cf>I'll take good care of you, too, Tyris.
Yes, it is. Bachelard is right.
Voldigen was made a subject of the Avalitia Shell Project <cf>
The result was a failure. <cf>Now he plans to merge with Shell on his own volition.
The goal is to bring the planetary beast under control ...... <cf>So, you want the world for yourself!
But to do so, we have to incorporate <cf>Watashi as a conformant ......
I will not fail to be vigilant, but <cf>when push comes to shove, I will trust you.
We were able to save Mr. Einrain. <cf>We owe it all back to your efforts.
You are indeed God's chosen people. <cf>On behalf of the Order of Bapharia, I thank you.
With the ceremony hosted by Prince Norbert, <cf>the relationship between the Order and the Duchy was completely restored.
The reconstruction of the main temple and the parish of Bernhardt is also progressing quickly with the help of <cf>the Principality.
Our faith will not disappear. <cf>The day will soon come when we will deliver our prayers to God as we used to.
Oh, Master. <cf>Thank you very much for this opportunity.
I don't know how to put it in simple words, but ...... <cf>I've been through a lot, and my mentor helped me through it.
My mother was taken away by someone and <cf>my father fell ill on the way to find her.
Still, there is York, and there is Einlein. <cf>Both Commander Dunkirk and Deputy Commander Veronica are ......
So many people have been there for me and then <cf>this happened ......
I'm sorry ....... I know it's not the time to be whiny, but...
Master. You don't have to leave. <cf>I will always fight with you if you want.
Don't keep it to yourself. Promise.
You really took care of me on this one.
I'm following the case again at ....... <cf>Seems the story was more deep-rooted than I thought.
Secrets of the Drava Royal Research Institute in Avaritia. <cf>Plus reports of dragon tribe involvement.
It's going to take a while to get the full story.
This is a case of such magnitude. <cf>Dunkirk will not be left to its own devices.
Perhaps there are still those who were in the dark behind the scenes. <cf>You guys better watch your backs.
I can't just <cf>casually help you out like I did with the coin pavilion anymore.
Being a king is inconvenient. Oh dear.
Oh, you are at ......! <cf>Please come on through.
My fall saved this country. <cf>...... isn't that right?
Without going into too much detail, that is!
Because they insist on <cf>holing up to keep the angel at bay.
It was left here: ......
I've been thinking lately that a life like Mr. Walken's isn't so bad <cf>
Adventurer Anchan. <cf>I need you to deliver fish again.
This time it ain't dried out. <cf>Hurry up and get it to the castle.
Stop complaining and move your feet!
That's impossible. <cf>A knight is a very important person, you know?
You must be a Bernhardt soldier!
Knights are cool, aren't they?
I'm going to be a knight of the duchy in the future! <cf>Isn't that awesome?
Dried fish, dried fish. Dried fish today and tomorrow.
I love dried fish. <cf>I could eat it every day and never get tired of it.
So our table will have dried fish again tonight!
The sea is shallow around here. <cf>Large ships can't dock here.
So all that comes are small boats.
Haaah~. I'm longing for a big ship, aren't I?
I'd love to travel around the world on a big ship someday.
Maybe even a nice romance?
Hey there, travelers. <cf>How about some foreign fruit?
You don't see these around here. <cf>They are matured and have a very special taste.
Look at me. <cf>If you eat it, your skin will be so soft and supple.
Hey, there, customer! <cf>It's a rare and colorful fruit around here!
What a gem from across the sea! <cf>It's a fruit from the resort town of Jubilia!
The other day a scholar came to do some research on our way of life. <cf>Apparently, our lifestyle is a historical document.
He said that a long time ago, this area was another country. <cf>I heard it was called the Kingdom of Drava.
The festival songs and dances performed in the village <cf>are remnants of the Drava Kingdom culture.
Most of the men in this village will be fishermen. <cf>That's the most solid way to make a living.
While the fishermen are at sea, the women do the work on land. <cf>They're making dried fish, making dibon, and preparing for the festival.
The younger guys seem to have a thing for knights and castle soldiers. ...... <cf>They'll get the hang of how this village works sooner or later.
Twin kings bring bad luck. ...... <cf>Bernhardt's Legend.
King V was a twin, but was killed by his brother. <cf>He is famous for being the last of the "Ruthless Kings.
During the Asterleeds War of Independence, his twin brother was king. <cf>And there are a couple of other episodes besides that.
It's just bad luck to say the least. <cf>That kind of thing bothers me.
Our Bernhardt Army, which prides itself on its military prowess, <cf>focuses on hands-on training.
That's why I wear out my weapons so <cf>often to get new ones.
I like the military awareness.
That's a lot of discarded weapons. ...... <cf>Once, there was an incident where a gang of wild thieves armed themselves with discarded weapons.
Boats are very important because fishermen's lives are in their hands. <cf>We take good care of them.
We've been living on this boat for ages. <cf>I'm sure the people in the castle are grateful for our fish!
I wish I could join a knight's school.
It's taught by a retired knight. <cf>I'm sure you'll hear some great stories.
I heard you can get a "test ni Suisen" too. <cf>What's a "test"?　Is it the name of a sword?
Using traditional Bernhardt techniques <cf>Take a look at this beautiful dyed fabric!
Asterleeds and Salamzart don't have the <cf>over-emphasized tints that Asterleeds and Salamzart have.
What a powerful history of this land. <cf>Don't you think?
The "Canaroan" ....... <cf>It used to be drunk only in this village. ......
Now it's a popular dee-bon. <cf>Even the locals can't get enough of it anymore.
It became popular with travelers and sold well, but ....... <cf>It's not suitable for mass production.
Sometimes I miss the days when I could drink as much as I wanted!
Outside the village lie the dead who died fighting the dragon tribe. <cf>The graves contain the victims of a war that once took place.
For hundreds of years, the people of this land have been fighting against the dragon tribe. <cf>Even from the ancient battlefield outside, you can feel the ferocity of the battle.
Now that the knight is coming to our village, we are at peace. <cf>We should be grateful to those in the castle. ......
Bernhardt is the largest nation on the Magna continent. <cf>Though, I heard it used to be much bigger.
The story goes that the three kings known as the "King of Invasion" ruled over most of <cf>the continent of Magna.
Since ...... is such a big Bernhardt, <cf>I'm not going to find out if I'm the only one slacking off here!
Eww, another fish delivery! <cf>I'm an adventurer! ......
Well, it's safer than fighting <cf>so I tend to take it on.
But hey, I'm getting tired of all the deliveries. <cf>I'm not a delivery guy. ......
OW! If you want to go sightseeing, ruins and old battlefields are popular.
If I had to make a food recommendation, it would be fish. <cf>Fresh fish is landed every day.
It's a nice village, have fun.
Peace is the best, I think to myself.
We should be thankful for the heroes of our country's salvation!
Hey, hey! Between you and me. <cf>I went to the Tower Rock mine the other day to get some ore.
I found a path through a crumbling mine shaft, so I <cf>managed to go deeper.
Then I found ruins I'd never seen before!
[--]And this excitement is still mine alone. ...... <cf>You want to go with me sometime?
Hey, hey, if you don't keep quiet, the cult is going to be very noisy. <cf>You'd better quickly report this to the Pioneer Bureau before they find out.
I think there was a guy once who wanted to monopolize a relic and didn't <cf>report it.
The head priest got angry and it was <cf>pretty tense between the Order and the Pioneering Bureau.
The adventurer who didn't say anything got a big squeeze. ...... <cf>[--] That's you, isn't it?
<span size="Big">Oh!　What am I going to do? &lt;/&gt;
...... excuse me, I'm distraught!
I am a spice shop in Asterleeds. <cf>I came to Bernhardt to stock up. ......
My liner stopped and I can't get back to <cf>Asterleeds!
No, the spices we just stocked up on are fine.
I'm worried about my son that I left behind in the store. <cf>Hope he is doing well. ......
I'm going to pretend I didn't see that coming from outside <cf>so you might as well leave here before you cause a scene.
Soldiers are also stationed there. <cf>If you stay quiet, you won't get caught.
Try not to cause a scene.
How long will the <cf>export ban on Asterleeds last? ......
I've got a package for Asterleeds at <cf>and it's still not getting sent!
The sky around here is always cloudy.
We fishermen use that cloudiness to <cf>read the fishing forecast and the waves.
We rarely see clear skies, but <cf>when we do, it's because we don't fish.
The cloudier it is, the better for us.
There ain't nothing to kill, right? <cf>The priestess and the knight, they ain't kids yet.
When in the world did this country become so <cf>barbaric ......
I hear it's almost time, Carvein's execution.
Damn, a knight of the duchy, <cf>, plotting the assassination of the duke. ......
He's a real son of a bitch!
[ーー]But, you know, after the assassination of the Prince, <cf>Dunkirk and Hugo have done a great job, haven't they?
Everything you do is right on the money.
Can't we just leave the country as it is? <cf>I'll be thinking about that.
The castle is not open to the public.
Of course I'd like to <cf>see the inside of a castle at least once!
In these times, right?
They're not going to let you into the castle for a long time, and if you go <cf>snooping around, you'll get caught.
I need to make a delivery to the castle. ...... <cf>I don't know what to do.
Just went to <cf>to say hi to the Commander after a long vacation break, and I was surprised!
I know everyone at <cf>HQ was buzzing about how scary it was, like people had changed.
Her hair is also white ...... <cf>and that signature all-back style ......
The way you're not willing to [narihu] <cf>must be very heartbroken.
Master Dunkirk loved Carvein like <cf>his own child, but ......
I never thought I'd be in a position to return the favor.
Thinking of you, Master York: ......
Even though Master Dunkirk is acting stout <cf>, I'm sure he's really in a lot of pain ......
Oh, it's you, ....... <cf>Thanks for bringing me home, man.
But hey, ......, look.
It's a dead end. ......
The guy who referred me for the job? <cf>Come on, ...... I don't know, I can't reach him anymore.
I thought there was hope back in Kanaloa, but <cf>I knew it was my life. ......
It's not your fault. I appreciate it. I really do.
But I'm already on ....... <cf>Sorry. Leave me alone this time. ......
Welcome to the "Two-Faced Coin Pavilion!
Thanks to you, the store is thriving. <cf>Sales are even higher than when your father was here.
I'm so proud of my business acumen. <cf>I'm destined to be the top of the top no matter what I do.
Now, what's the Order? <cf>If you're just chilling, I'm home, I'm home!
Oh, it's you guys. <cf>Anything with the dragon tribe since then?
It was Leanbluhm, wasn't it, lurking in our house? <cf>That dragon tribe is the most troublesome type we've ever seen.
It's as if he's been doing whatever he wants to do with the organization of the principality. <cf>Even now, they're having a hard time rebuilding.
We couldn't even deploy soldiers or knights. <cf>They tried to cut down the principality from the inside.
I'm sure there were few <cf>that could turn that kind of petty wisdom.
If you run into them again, be careful. <cf>The dragon tribe, they seem to have a different approach now.
Mr. Tyris seems to be sleeping ......
[The wards are fine. <cf>We are taking turns putting them up.
We don't always have to be here, all of us. <cf>We all need ...... rest when we can.
I would be fine on my own. <cf>This is also the role of ...... oracle priestess, so
ぐぬぬぬぬ……！ <cf>I'm almost ...... almost there and the mystery should be solved!
Listen to me! <cf>The ruins I found the other day were really interesting!
We hired adventurers, we camped on our own. <cf>I've been doing all the research I can to find out what's going on. ......
I was one step away from running out of funds! <cf>Ahh!　A great discovery awaits me just around the corner!
When the money runs out, people won't help me! <cf>The world is a very hard place!
If this happens, ...... has no choice. <cf>I guess I'll have to make some money with "that thing" after all these years.
That pendant, you must treasure it.
Yup. I guess that's the only clue ...... my parents have. <cf>I dunno.
Someday I want to go to <cf>to find my mom and dad with the help of a pendant.
Oh, that's right. ....... <cf>Sorry!　I asked tactlessly.
Ah, yes! <cf>Then how about I lend you my pendant?
They seem to be almost identical, and having <cf>would give you some peace of mind, wouldn't it?
Ha-ha-ha!　What are you talking about anymore? <cf>That's what Carvein gave you, isn't it?
Neither my pendant nor your pendant <cf>can replace either of them.
So, Carvein needs to take good care of it properly.
That's true. <cf>I said something that doesn't make sense.
Anyway, don't lose heart. <cf>I'm here for you, and so is Einrain.
Hmmm, thanks. <cf>That's very kind of you, Carvein.
Charlotte. That pendant ....... <cf>It was a clue to finding your parents, wasn't it?
I don't mean to blame the masters, but ....... <cf>It's the ...... that broke them.
It's okay, Carvein. <cf>I appreciate your concern.
The pendant is now broken inside, but the pendant isn't <cf>gone.
Compared to the fact that everyone was safe, <cf>it's not a big deal. Really.
...... I see that. Sorry. <cf>I said something that belittled your feelings.
Someday, I'll help you find your parents. <cf>Don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Yeah. Thanks.
Oh, hi. <cf>By the way, have you seen our apprentice?
We do our research as we please. <cf>We often do things separately.
Ale seems to be more interested in <cf>even older civilizations than the Bapharia civilization.
It is good to be interested in your own way. <cf>If you imitate others in everything, you will not make progress.
We say "master and disciple," but it doesn't matter. <cf>That thing is that thing, and we just have to find a way to go forward.
However, I've been feeling a lack of motivation lately, or so I've been told by ....... <cf>I don't know what it is, but I'm not in a good mood.
Oh dear, I finally made it home.
We were stranded in Kanaloa. <cf>I wondered what we would have done if we had stayed there.
I wonder what the Knights of Bernhardt were thinking ....... <cf>They were a good nuisance to folks like us.
I have been worried about my son. <cf>I'll try to be selfish for a while.
Dad's back!　Yay!
I wasn't worried at all. <cf>It's just that the liner stopped for a while, that's all.
A merchant as good as my dad is, <cf>he's used to accidents like that.
Hehe, I'm glad you're happy. ...... <cf>I'll let you have lots of fun on your next vacation!
An adventurer who went to Cape Rauwehara gave me <cf>a drawing of a creature they call a mermaid!
A large shark stood up and <cf>looked like a subhuman with a weapon as it was ......
Something different from what I thought ......
We, the Zilwet Traveling Troupe, <cf>have decided to stay in Salamzart for a while!
There has been a lot of noise at <cf>about the Duchy of Bernhardt and other things, so I thought I'd share some of the latest news with you.
I thought this would be a good opportunity for the group to get some rest.
Speaking of which, the Star Festival is about to open soon, and <cf>there are some young people who are going to go and see it!
If Char had been here, she would have been <cf>clamoring to be taken to the Star Festival!
Because I was looking forward to seeing the divas. <cf>I think I'll be able to relax here this time.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>How is Charlotte doing?
She can be a bit of a daredevil. <cf>Please tell her not to do anything reckless.
Didn't the Duchy of Bernhardt have some trouble? <cf>I hope I don't get involved in that kind of thing.
Hey! You've come to the right place. <cf>Hey! You've come to the right place.
It is a Special☆Menu limited to the Seirei Festival!
The best ingredients, at an affordable price! <cf>I'm afraid of my business acumen to make it happen!
I've got all kinds of business seeds I've been thinking about for a while. <cf>The coin-operated pavilion is the top seller!
What!　The Seirei Festival has been canceled?
Gimme a break! Are you kidding me? <cf>I've already ordered the ingredients!
I can't do Cancel now!
Huh?　If you guys find a diva, we can have a <cf>star festival ......?
Tell me that as soon as you can!　So good! <cf>That's something you're going to have to do.
I'm counting on you!　The fate of Coin Pavilion depends on you! <cf>Good luck!
The militia, as you know, was apparently paid for.
I'm still not sure how to get to the employer, but <cf>I hear they didn't just give up and back down.
The employer must be a nasty guy! <cf>He must be sneaking around, hiding in plain sight.
If I knew where he was, I'd go get him myself.
The other side, on the contrary, will be looking for your whereabouts. <cf>Maybe that's why they attacked the masters.
Don't do anything too obvious. <cf>Your safety is paramount.
I know. But ...... darn it.
God ......!　Really, I can't believe you were there: ......
I was surprised ....... <cf>Because it's not even the voice of the oracle, not even close.
The oracle feels flatter, ...... colder, more
But Mr. Aerinse is different. <cf>She is very kind and warm ......
I can't tell everyone, but I'm ...... <cf>I am happy to see God ......
Master ....... I'm not feeling it yet, myself.
Going back in time...... I can't believe that I can freely go back and forth between the past and the future. <cf>It's so tremendous, I can't even imagine it.
That is exactly what God does. ...... <cf>Is that possible for the Bapharia Gods?
...... You don't think my mom could do it? <cf>Can you really do that if you're a Bapharia deity tribe?
No, I don't get it. ...... <cf>I can't seem to wrap my head around it.
I wonder if York would have understood. <cf>This is the kind of story he would love to hear.
Far in the future...... this world is going to be destroyed.
I don't know why ....... Ever since I heard that story, <cf>my body hasn't stopped shaking.
It's thousands of years away, but <cf>somehow it feels like it's right in front of us. ......
Heh, that's weird, me! <cf>I don't think I'm that scared.
Um, ......!　I have a favor to ask you: ......
To God ...... Aerinse, please ......
Well, you know, ......, I'll keep it to myself.
............ sign, I want ............
God's, signature. I'll treasure it. ......
Just give me a break or something. <cf>Please, please do it secretly!
I'm [not] a [sic] about worldly matters, but <cf>Charlotte's singing voice seems to be well received by the people!
I have heard a number of divas, and <cf>they were stunning and comparable to those!
And I didn't realize that she really has the qualities of a diva. ......
With all due respect, being a Star Spirit Diva is not a light role that can be filled by a traveling entertainer <cf>
Does Ms. Charlotte have any secret predispositions ......? <cf>No, that's too much of an evil guess.
Everything is the will of the God of Bapharia. <cf>Let us take all possible measures to ensure that the Star Festival will go off without a hitch!
I heard you met with Hugo. <cf>They've been reporting back from the other side.
He was a hard man to eat, wasn't he? <cf>But he's got guts, and he's smart, and he's a great guy.
Dunkirk was indeed not against me, but he <cf>had a hand in it here and there.
The restoration of relations between the Principality and the Order, the resupply of supplies for the Order. <cf>Hugo is doing a good job of keeping things running.
I can't quite read some of the thoughts at ....... <cf>Well, I hope you're good at keeping up with them.
Hey! How's it going? <cf>Did you find the diva?　Are you okay with the Seirei Festival?
...... one more? <cf>Not confirmed yet.Hum......
Why don't I run for office? <cf>OK! Music, Come on!
Hmm?　Do I need special qualities? <cf>I see. I was going to show off my beautiful voice.
No, on second thought, we can't leave the store empty. <cf>I'll take care of it!　Go for it!
In our time, the Hoshirei Matsuri was a phantom festival that has long since ceased to be held <cf>
There is a record that there was a star spirit diva, but I don't know <cf>what kind of person or how she went about the ritual!
I understand that Lalaforte, who was our last diva, is at <cf>Cape Rauwehara.
Please find them so that we can hold the Star Spirit Festival. <cf>I would like to speak to you personally as well.
The forest people are a subhuman race that is close to humans in appearance and lifestyle <cf>
Cape Rauwehara and some other exchanges. <cf>Sometimes children are born to both
Lalaforte is one such person. <cf>Of course, one's origin has nothing to do with one's faith in God.
She has fulfilled her duties and served God admirably both as a priestess and as a star spirit diva <cf>
She should be back in her hometown now, recuperating. <cf>If she could, she would love to be a diva too!
All is God's will. <cf>Please meet Lalaforte.
By the way, this is a very nice place!
There is a tranquility that makes you forget the hustle and bustle of the city <cf>and yet there is the vibrancy of a growing city ......
Hmmm... ...... I'm looking forward to this place becoming part of Bernhardt. <cf>
What a joke. <cf>We will not rule by force.
The purpose is only to establish friendly relations. <cf>We are here on an inspection tour for that purpose.
You might want to do yourself a favor for later: ....... <cf>Oops, now that was a naught.
I'll behave for the benefit of the locals. <cf>Please, don't worry.
Lalaforte's, nasty. <cf>You didn't have to make me sing all of a sudden.
You seem to be in a bad mood. <cf>I may have overstepped the mark earlier.
Well, well, don't be so blind. <cf>Your song is not so bad either. ......
That's it!　It has a unique taste, or <cf>it's one-of-a-kind!
I told you I'm not good at ......
Oh, no!　I've been bending the navel more and more.
This is no good. Let's leave him alone for a while.
............ song, I'm practicing.
I've gone completely sulky.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
"Numerous Mosses," ...... please ......
...... can be found at ...... in the "Valley of the [Coral Rock]".
I'm relieved to see that Tyris' expression has softened <cf>, if only slightly!
I can't imagine what that girl is feeling right now <cf>but ......
I'm really glad <cf>that your suffering has diminished, even if only slightly.
We have to be <cf>careful to rescue them properly.
First, let's hold a star ceremony.
I will take care of Tyris. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
I heard a very beautiful singing voice just now.
Wow, that was that woman's song? <cf>That's amazing.
If you can sing like that, <cf>it must have been painful to lose your voice.
I'm glad your throat is better. <cf>Hopefully we'll get to hear you sing more slowly one day.
The political upheaval in the Duchy of Bernhardt has subsided, but <cf>the wounds Accepted by the Order are not healed!
Two "Star Spirit Divas" ...... have fallen to the [deadly] blade. <cf>They are not coming back.
In the Bapharia celebration, <cf>only the "Star Spirit Diva" is responsible for the songs dedicated to God.
Even if they didn't have a role, those two were <cf>charming and irreplaceable!
It was taken from us by the Duchy of Bernhardt. <cf>...... I still cannot accept
Please pray that the two divas may rest in the presence of God.
The Forest People are a subhuman race living in the Koaniani Forest of the [Outer Continent (Outer Continent)] <cf>
They are very close to humans and have been in contact with them since ancient times. <cf>Unlike goblins, they are highly intelligent and speak the language.
A species of equal friends, I guess.
There are a number of interesting characteristics. <cf>One is that they maintain a youthful appearance and have a long life span!
They live for hundreds of years, so some of them have been trading since Asterleeds became independent <cf>
That's how the diva Lalaforte might <cf>live a long life!
If she were to serve as a star-spirit diva for generations to come <cf>her name would be etched in the history of the Order!
Lalaforte is a priest of the blood of the people of the forest.
Although born into a different culture, he has a deep <cf>understanding of the Bapharia faith and is an exemplary layman.
She is also fulfilling her duties as a diva. <cf>She even holds classes and teaches singing!
I can be a little overzealous in my teaching. ......
Hi, I see you found a medicine for your throat.
A unique medicine passed down to the forest people, huh. ...... <cf>Well, that's no wonder we don't have it in our store.
Hmmm, I thought about getting together in the future but ....... <cf>I guess I'm not in demand. I don't know what to do. ......
Hey, hey, that priestess named Lalaforte, <cf>she can speak properly now!
It looks like the medicine worked. That's good, right?
It looks like I'm going back to Asterleeds already. <cf>I guess Bapharia priests are busy.
Lalaforte, I knew you were the "Star Spirit Diva"!
That's tough that you can't sing. <cf>I'm so glad you're on the mend.
Are we going to have a star festival? <cf>I might want to go and listen to Lalaforte sing!
Oh, are you looking for little Lalaforte?
I'm sure she has a room at the "Pupu House". <cf>Just leave the village and go along the Coast to get there.
She is a very polite and nice girl. <cf>That's why I really feel sorry for her that she can't speak up.
Would you be willing to help, adventurer? <cf>Please.
Lalaforte, you look like you're feeling better!
Good, good. <cf>I came all the way here to thank you, too, Ata.
[Thank you very much for sharing your fish <cf>. It was delicious.
If you are in trouble, it's mutual. <cf>I hope you will come visit me again!
I think we found our third diva.
Go to Minsterhorn. <cf>Lugerio will be there first.
Charlotte is in training with Lalaforte!
It's not a song, it's the rituals and greetings of the Star Festival. <cf>Ms. Lalaforte was all over the place.
[I'll beat you until your body moves on its own even when you're asleep! <cf>Get used to it rather than learn it!　Feel rather than think! ["]......
I'm in the basement over there. <cf>They say no one is allowed in there, no matter how many people.
Sometimes there is a tremendous screeching and whipping sound, but ....... <cf>Charlotte. He will get over it!
The "Tower Rock Mine Site" was recently reported and is just beginning to be managed by <cf>the Order!
As is customary, the discovery of an archaeological site should be reported to <cf>the cult.
Apparently, some adventurers failed to do so. ...... <cf>It's a total headache.
As for the "metal plate", we will keep it at the church for the time being. <cf>If there is no problem, we will return it to Ms. Millene.
This is for the Star Spirit Diva. <cf>I would appreciate your help in investigating the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins."
Wow, but I didn't know I was a star spirit diva. <cf>I'm surprised, but I'm honored.
I've been watching the Seirei Matsuri since I was a little girl. <cf>I've even admired divas for a long time.
I've always liked singing and I'm good at it. <cf>Sometimes I even sing to fund my research.
Oh, is that kind of thing okay? <cf>It would be bad if a star-spirit diva sang in a bar or on the street, right?
Hmmm ...... Well, we can think about that later! <cf>Anyway, for now, metal plate, metal plate...
Come on, come on, come on, come and get it! <cf>Hah~ Oh, God, I'm looking forward to it now!
The third diva ...... Millene, you say?
I'm glad you found someone who is qualified. <cf>Now I think we can have a star festival: ......
And everyone is looking forward to it. <cf>If you can make it again this year, ...... glad ......
I may be away here at ....... <cf>I hope you all enjoy the Seirei Festival!
I hear a feverish voice from the other side of the door.
Yes, there!　Stand up straight and tall! <cf>Hold still!　See, no chin down!
It's a drawl!　Smile, sm~il! <cf>Don't pull your arms!　Keep it, keep it.
Also ...... impossible, limit ......!
It's impossible for those who think it's impossible! <cf>Now then, let's move on to vocal exercises!
Keep the same posture, but start with deep breathing!
Here, in this position ......!　No way! <cf>Absolutely, I can't ...... make a sound!
Oh my goodness~?　You've got a good voice now, don't you? <cf>If you have that much energy, you still have time to spare.
You are indeed a reputed diva, Charlotte. <cf>It's worth the workout! Ugh, ugh, ugh... ......
Hiccup!　Ca, Carvein!　Einlein! <cf>Please, help me!　Oh no!
んっふふ～♪　さあさあ、金属板ちゃん♪ <cf>今日も隠された歴史の神秘を見せておくれ
This is really amazing! <cf>The more I look into it, the more things come to light!
I can look up all the books and records in the temple as much as I want. <cf>I think my research will progress at once!
People who built a society older than the Bapharia civilization. <cf>They left behind mysterious songs that are not transmitted today: ......
This is a lie that needs to be unraveled! <cf>Come on, let's do it!
Mwah!　...... Oh, it's you!
No, I was just passing by. <cf>I saw that thing.
What does Chief Priest Lugerio have to do with the <cf>thing?
The chief priest is the one who unites those stone-headed priests. <cf>He has repeatedly interfered with my research.
Are you going to interrupt my research on the Ununu ...... thing? <cf>Or are you going to blow my certainty and ......!
Oh, no! No matter how much you say you are the chief priest, <cf>there are some things you can do and some things you can't do!
What's up, I hear you can now open the Asterleeds' Star Festival at <cf>
I had heard that the event would be canceled this year. <cf>It would be a great thing if it could be done.
When people are upset, having the festival as usual <cf>is a great relief.
The Principality is also sending troops to guard the area. <cf>The guy from Hugo must be in charge.
What's the trouble again, anyway? <cf>I'm sure I can be of some help to you guys.
I'm asking you to take care of the Star Festival. <cf>Make sure it goes off without a hitch and reassure the people.
I heard about the attack on the divas at the Seirei Festival. <cf>Sounds like it was a bigger story than I thought.
We are responsible for the hole in security. <cf>We owe you guys again. Sorry about that.
When Hugo comes back, I will ask him about the details.
I don't think it's as important as Dunkirk. ...... <cf>I don't like the idea of anyone messing with the Star Festival either.
It's show time! <cf>It's finally Stage for the divas!
Climax Event for the Star Festival! <cf>Stores are important, but you can't miss this one!
Thanks to you, we're thriving, record sales. <cf>I have to say a word of thanks to the gods of Bapharia.
I'll leave the restaurant to the part-timers. <cf>I'll leave the shop to him, the guy I asked for when I went to Kanaloa.
Let's pray <cf>quietly with a solemn chant for today at least, Ze.
Foo...... is still excited, I guess.
It was the best Hoshirei Matsuri ever! <cf>I've never seen such an Amazing Stage!
I liked the usual stern chant, but <cf>I guess the Order approves of Groovy songs like that.
I've changed my mind a little bit. <cf>I think it would be easier for young people to go to the ritual.
I'm glad the Star Festival went well. <cf>Lugerio was ...... a little angry, but ......
Charlotte and her friends sang a fancy song on stage. ...... <cf>Really?
It's a place to thank God <cf>I don't think that kind of thing is very good ...... but ......
...... hey, I wish I could have listened to it.
Well, it is indeed a Hoshirei Matsuri (Star Festival). <cf>It's so lively and nice!
If I didn't have to work, I'd be giving myself up to a moment of <cf>rest with a beautiful woman!
Our soldiers are excellent, and we have guards from the Order. <cf>I think it will be fine if we leave it to the field.
And there are some great adventurers like yourselves, right?
Well, I will be there for the inspection and I will be entertained. <cf>And I will see the Star Spirit Diva on stage.
With the addition of Miss Charlotte, this year's <cf>stage is sure to be a highlight!
I'm looking forward to it now. Oh, I can't wait!
Oh, well, well, well. <cf>Have you also come to see the Star Festival?
I am a priest myself. <cf>I should at least show up at the Star Festival.
Well, I wasn't really invited.
But really, I didn't know that thing was chosen to be a star spirit diva: ......
Indeed, a diva need not be a priestess. <cf>We have records of them being elected by the citizens.
But that thing is ....... <cf>As for the singing, well, he seemed to be pretty proficient there.
No, I'm not here to check up on you! <cf>I just wanted to make sure you weren't neglecting your research. ......
...... Mm. Well, it's that thing's decision. <cf>If it does its duty, so be it.
I will look at the city at random and return to my research. Well then.
With all the recent turmoil, <cf>we thought it was too late for the Hoshinrei Festival!
It is a pleasure to welcome the Star Spirit Diva to the <cf>Star Spirit Festival!
We thank God for Bapharia. <cf>And to all of you for your efforts.
thank you very much
This diva's stage is a very special one. <cf>We, the priests, will be present as much as possible.
As many as possible must express their gratitude to God. <cf>For today, the theater is the center of the Bapharia religion!
Thank you <cf>for protecting our Temple!
Who would have thought that there would be such an infidel <cf>who would storm the temple during the Hoshinrei Festival ......
It is utterly deplorable. <cf>And we should be ashamed of ourselves for allowing it to happen.
In the future, we need to strengthen the security of our temples. <cf>We must be more certain of our faith in God.
Oh dear. I thought I would be able to go home <cf>easily once the Hoshirei Festival was over...
With all the commotion that has occurred, <cf>we can't just pull our troops out.
We're also looking into <cf>about the infidel who attacked the diva and the temple!
But ...... I'm surprised that Miss Charlotte survived. <cf>You allowed the bandits to enter the back of the theater, didn't you?
When you're being pushed to the throat like that, <cf>you're usually at your wit's end.
It appears that you are a bad luck person. ...... <cf>No, I'm talking about this one.
I will let the Temple know if I learn anything. <cf>Good bye.
As you can see, we are guards sent by the Principality of Bernhardt to <cf>
We just had an incident like that. ...... <cf>I was expecting a strong windfall for us.
The people of Asterleeds and the Bapharia Order are willing to help <cf>for the Star Festival!
I'm more ashamed of myself for being so insecure.
I think some of us just can't get out of our ruts.
But this exchange is mutually beneficial. <cf>It is our responsibility to try to make it so.
Right, okay!　Left OK!　No abnormalities today!
I am a soldier of the venerable Principality of Bernhardt! <cf>I will not let a suspicious person pass me by!
Mhm!　You think I'm suspicious? <cf>No wonder the people of Asterleeds think so!
We are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the recent incident. <cf>I cannot apologize enough to the Order of Bapharia.
At the very least, the Hoshinrei Festival, which you are all looking forward to, <cf>we are sincerely determined to protect and preserve!
Right, okay!　Left OK! <cf>Mwah!　I'll have to keep a close watch on the top and the bottom!
We are from the outer continent.
I heard there was going to be a star festival. <cf>I thought it might be nice to take my grandson to see it.
There were all sorts of stalls. <cf>I just got hungry!
Okay, well, we can go to the theater, right? <cf>But where is it?
This city is too big. The streets are so convoluted, <cf>you'll get more lost than in the woods.
Wow, ni, I just got talked to by a human. ......
Um, that ......! <cf>I'm not used to big cities. ......
Oh, grandma, I'm still scared!
The Star Festival is finally starting!
Well, I am glad we were able to hold it again this year. <cf>After all, the Hoshinrei Festival is something special.
When I hear the singing voice of the Star Spirit Diva, I feel <cf>like this.
I'm working security here, so it's too bad I won't be able to see <cf>the diva in person~!
Well, I can hear your voice through the door. <cf>I'll enjoy that one.
The Star Spirit Diva will be here soon!
I'm looking forward to <cf>to hear what kind of singing voice you have for us!
Well, that was a song that went way beyond what ...... imagined!
I'm talking about the Star Spirit Diva, of course. <cf>You wouldn't expect a stage like that.
I heard so many cheers and got as excited here as I did in <cf>
And I opened the door and peeked in without thinking. <cf>I'll submit a reflection later!
Hey, I got it!　All right, I got it!
The guards are patrolling the edges of the temple. <cf>Surprisingly, the most conspicuous places are not so well protected!
It's impossible because you're trying to sneak in! <cf>If you go on the assumption that you will be found from the beginning, you will find ......
Who the hell are you, ......? <cf>No, no, no, since when did I hear about you!
No, that was a ...... joke, of course! <cf>I'm talking about the fact that you can't sneak into the temple, so don't do it!
Here!　You'll be suspected, too, if you stay in a place like this! <cf>I left early, I left!
Have you seen the Seirei Festival?
Charlotte!　Our Charlotte has made it to <cf>a big part of the Star Spirit Diva!
I was surprised! <cf>I hadn't even been told about it.
If you had told me one word about it, I would have flown over. <cf>Totally ......
Well, I'm glad you are doing well. <cf>It will be a good foil for our next show!
No, but is it safe to invite a star spirit diva to a troupe performance <cf>?　Ummm ......
I heard. <cf>I heard that Charlotte has taken on the role of Star Spirit Diva?
I am in awe that she has such a big role. <cf>I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.
Whatever, if you're doing well, that's all that matters.
If she's a star-spirit diva, her name will be in all kinds of places. <cf>Maybe even reach the girl's real parents.
I hope it turns out for the better.
Well, the Star Festival was a big deal.
I knew Lalaforte liked bright songs, <cf>but I thought he would be quiet at the Star Festival, as expected.
And there was no ruffling of feathers last time.
But ...... with Charlotte and Millene <cf>the stage was lively and good!
Chief Priest Lugerio looked bitter, but <cf>the people of the city loved it!
Traditions and customs should be respected. <cf>However, we believe that we should not be too rigid in our adherence to them.
This is how new traditions are created. <cf>It's the passage of time, isn't it?
I wasn't the diva this time~♪
The Bapharia cult has no eyes to see~~~ <cf>How can they not see my qualities~~~~?
I wonder if I won't be chosen because I'm saying this~♪ <cf>I'm sorry if that's the case....
But it's fun to sing with everyone in town... <cf>Bapharia ~~ To Our ~~ God~~!
The Star Festival is a solemn and prestigious celebration dedicated to the Gods of Bapharia <cf>
Do you understand?　It's definitely different from the <cf>vulgar festivals where people get merry and make a fuss.
The diva of the star spirit must also be accompanied by holiness and grace
You decorate it on a poster with a lot of words! <cf>What do you think you are doing, praying to God? I outrageous!
The Seirei Matsuri is not a game. Butsubutsu ......
No running and no noise in the theater. <cf>Please be careful not to disturb others.
Because the god of Bapharia is watching you.
Don't panic, there is still time to start. <cf>Let's say a peaceful prayer with the divas!
It's almost time for the diva to take the stage. <cf>Oh no, I'm looking forward to it!
I've been waiting for this ever since I saw the poster for the Star Festival.
This year's Star Festival will be something different. <cf>It will be an awesome memory. I have a feeling about it!
Oh, God, it's late!
I left the kids with my husband. <cf>I got there before him.
Hurry up or you'll miss the diva! <cf>I don't know where you've been wandering around, at all!
One of the attackers of the Star Festival has been captured by <cf>Lord Carvein!
We are conducting an interrogation in the basement of the Temple of Asterleeds. <cf>You are all invited to be present.
I am finishing the post-processing. <cf>If you need anything else, please let me know.
I have to write down <cf>as a document of the Order about the recent Hoshirei Festival: ......
How do you think <cf>should describe that second song?
There was too much commotion and I had lost track of it. ......
Isn't the biggest problem in the eyes of the congregation <cf>that a song like that was offered at the Star Festival?
No tradition, no prestige, nothing like that <cf>just floating around ...... Oh, the lamentable
This is not a good sign to the congregation. <cf>I am truly sorry that you have taken the liberty of doing this.
How hard we worked for the Star Festival and ......
[--]Excuse me. I have no right to blame you people. <cf>Please do not listen to what I just said.
Huh ....... It's all a headache: ......
Grisonia grass should be growing in clumps at several locations in Cape Rauwehara <cf>
And to use it as a poison, <cf>it must be prepped immediately after collection!
If there is a hideout, <cf>it's probably very close to the cluster
We know it's a dangerous poison, so <cf>local residents won't go near it, and
I think it would be a good idea to check <cf>around the Grisonia grass colony
After Dunkirk, Hugo is next: ......
No, they were connected from the beginning, not next. <cf>Maybe it was Hugo who was the mastermind.
I didn't see it coming, and I'm sorry I didn't see it coming, and I'm sorry Charlotte and you guys <cf>got me into trouble. Sorry.
As for Hugo, I'll leave the <cf>inspection mission at Cape Rauwehara as ongoing.
He went to investigate the backcountry and disappeared. After some time, <cf>, a death report arrives from the field: .......
When the Knight Commander followed by a high civilian officer is dead, <cf>it's hard to keep everyone upset.
And if you've been involved in something that's not right, <cf>it could shake up the whole principality.
I'll wash my hands of Hugo's breathing down my neck. <cf>I'll take care of this side.
The excitement of the Hoshinrei Festival seems to have calmed down. <cf>We, too, are back to normal business operations.
But it takes an ordinary businessman to relax here. <cf>The top of the top is not so easy!
Seirei Matsuri☆Thanks Campaign! <cf>We're going to sell the new menu in a big way!
Other stores are taking a breatherNow! <cf>Golden Chance to make a difference at once!
My Business Sense is screaming. <cf>This road leads to the Coin Pavilion and my future!
Tyris ...... why on earth ......
Where have they gone this time? ...... <cf>We had just arrived here.
...... No, this is no time to be brokenhearted. <cf>This time I must bring Tyris back to you.
I don't feel as much <cf>engram turbulence here as I did when Shell was chronoleaphed before!
Perhaps they just moved locations. <cf>Tyris will still remain in this time period.
Now all we have to do is find out where they are. <cf>I guess we'll just have to look around for this one: ......
But I will not give up. <cf>Please lend me your help as well.
Tyris is ......[Mitsuka] Ii is ......
If I had been well warded, I would have ......
No oracle, no nothing. <cf>I ...... don't know what to do. ......
I'm sorry. ......
That voice that called my name, was it ...... <cf>really my mom?
The more I think about ...... mom, the more I think about <cf>the more I don't understand
A member of the Bapharia God Clan, he has a history with Hugo, <cf>and is now an avaritia shell: ......
What the hell happened to my mom?
And the master [--] Oh, it's Master Merlouf. <cf>I knew he was strong, but I didn't know he had such magical powers.
I don't know ...... too much about anything ......!
...... is why I want to know. <cf>What should we face now and what should we do?
Master. Let's find Mr. Tyris and find your mother. <cf>We shouldn't be standing still!
I probably shouldn't be saying this, but <cf>Thanks for the Hugo thing!
It was incredible and <cf>I couldn't have gotten through it without you.
So I just wanted to say thank you. <cf>Thank you so much.
I'm so worried about you, Tyris. <cf>We need to find her and save her as soon as possible!
I may not be much help, but I can at least encourage Einrain and the others here <cf>
And ...... let me think about things. <cf>What it means that I was born and met you.
Accepted. <cf>"I have heard that an emissary has disappeared from the Sanctuary of Blessings.
As a denomination, let's devote as many people as we can to the <cf>search!
However, there is also the matter of the attack on the Star Festival. <cf>We must also strengthen the security of the Sanctuary of Blessings.
Because we must not let anything happen to the <cf>oracle priestess as it did to the Duchy of Bernhardt.
We will inform you of the whereabouts of the [mitsuka] as soon as we know. <cf>Please wait for us.
His Majesty the Prince has changed his mood lately, hasn't he?
I heard <cf>that when Dunkirk was here, he hardly laughed.
I'm telling you, they're laughing more openly now.
It must be tough inside the castle after an incident like that. <cf>He is a strong man who is carrying his country on his shoulders!
I'm talking about the fact that we don't know where Master Hugo is.
Something about being involved in an incident. ...... <cf>I can't get the details from them.
He is indispensable to the Principality. <cf>I hope he's okay.
We have a lot of cleaning up to do after the Hoshirei Matsuri. <cf>I don't think the public will be able to enter the theater for a while.
But a lot of people come to just see the entrance <cf>It's like a tourist attraction!
I guess the star-spirit divas must have been very <cf>popular this time around!
Oh, Grizonia grass? <cf>We don't carry it.
It's a useful poisonous plant for hunting animals in the forest. <cf>I hear the forest people have been using it for centuries.
But in Jubilia, fishing is the basic way of life. <cf>We can't just spray poison in the ocean, can we?
I haven't heard of any stores selling it around here. <cf>If you want it, I guess you'll have to collect it yourself.
There seem to be several colonies. <cf>Just be careful when you touch them because they are dangerous, okay?
It's interesting that in Jubilia, the goods that customers are looking for are different from Asterleeds at <cf>
Condiments, sturdy clothes, and farm equipment sell well. <cf>Bapharia's heritage is not so popular.
Jubilia is still in the process of development. <cf>It seems we can't have too many goods that are too rich.
I hope there will be more trade and <cf>more things will be overflowing!
I haven't seen any change in Tyris since then.
When Ms. Einrain sang, <cf>why did Tyris' consciousness surface?
I also tried to sing a song that Tyris liked <cf>Unfortunately, no change!
Aerinse, who worked at Coco during the Star Festival, <cf>I heard it was for a limited time only.
Oh, I wonder if I'll ever see her smile again <cf>
How many <cf>adventurers have been soothed by that smile ......
This is Jubilia. Welcome.
[It is a frontier area on the edge of the Outer Continent. <cf>It is also a resort area that can be easily accessed from Asterleeds.
What do you think?　The sea and the sandy beaches. <cf>It has a different charm from the beaches of Asterleeds!
I love the atmosphere at night. <cf>The stars are full and the sea reflecting them is beautiful.
A shot of Dibon would <cf>be a match made in heaven!
Cottages and guesthouses are also lined up. <cf>Why don't you take a walk along the seaside?
Jubilia is going to keep growing and developing!
Sir, did you come from the Magna Continent? <cf>Wow, you are very welcome!
The village of Jubilia is focusing on tourism. <cf>It's still small and its other industries are weak.
But we're slowly adding some specialty products. <cf>We deal in the traditional textiles of the region.
Other popular items are pearls. <cf>Processed ones are sent to Asterleeds.
You can get it here at a great price. <cf>Invite your friends and come visit us!
Hmm?　Are you guys looking for something for your throat?
Some time ago a lady from the forest folk asked me about it. <cf>I think I hurt my throat so bad I lost my voice.
I wanted to help, but I wasn't sure <cf>what I needed.
They didn't seem to have it at home. <cf>I went home disappointed.
Over there you can see Jubilia's famous <cf>sea cottages!
This is where you will be staying today. <cf>Please rest with the sound of the rippling waves.
Breakfast is served with fresh seafood and fruit <cf>in abundance!
We hope you enjoy your trip to Jubilia!
...... Okay, it's time for the tour group to arrive. <cf>I'll be a good guide!
Is that figure a tourist?
I have come from the forests of my hometown with a desire to do business.
I would like to ask the villagers here <cf>to teach me how to do it!
I guess you could say I'm the odd man out among the forest folk.
If you wish to visit the forest, be careful. <cf>This is not a land that welcomes outsiders with open arms.
[There are subhumans called 'forest people' living in the outer continent.
They often come to Jubilia. <cf>Some of them even stay there.
We've been interacting with humans for a long time, <cf>and some of us even hook up and become husband and wife.
Even though humans and forest people are bonding, <cf>it's going to be hard to live with a family.
I can't help but feel a bit of a chip on my shoulder, and <cf>I'm sure the child born will have a hard time.
In that sense, Lalaforte is admirable. <cf>She worked hard to become a star spirit diva.
It's a special position in the Bapharia Order. <cf>They say they are treated as well as the first priests.
I'm glad the kid's efforts paid off.
Welcome!　Looking for some meat?
We have everything from Minsterhorn to Larpal to <cf>Bernhardt.
Of course we have some from Jubilia, <cf>but we're still improving it because we can't get rid of the smell a bit.
I like it. <cf>Let the customers choose what they want.
Because it's grilled right next to you and ready to eat. <cf>Wandering around with a skewer in your hand is also a fun way to see the sights!
Thanks every time! <cf>It's roast meat, Jubilia style!
Don't think of them as mere skewers! <cf>It is a gem that is particular about both the meat and the way it is grilled!
Especially this firewood. It's from deep in Cape Rauwehara <cf>I go to great lengths to use the fragrant wood.
The appetizing aroma will permeate the meat. <cf>It would be best if you sprinkle some of the local seaweed salt on it!
A cheap and tasty Jubilia specialty! <cf>You can buy the meat next door. Here you go!
Huh?　I thought this place used to bake potatoes.
Jubilia's specialty is roasted potatoes on skewers. <cf>They were delicious, but as expected, a bit plain.
Maybe it didn't sell very well.
I think the change to meat is a good idea. <cf>I think this one will be more popular as a specialty.
Good fish are coming in from Asterleeds and Kanaloa. <cf>It's a bargain!
We catch seafood in Jubilia, too. <cf>But not enough to sell.
They're mainly ornamental, they don't have a lot of meat, and <cf>a lot of them are poisonous.
Meat is more popular than fish. <cf>It's odd for a seaside village to be so dependent on trade.
I'm a boatman on a cruise ship.
Well, in short, we just go around this area <cf>by boat!
Weaving through coral reefs and rocks. <cf>It's surprisingly popular and well received.
It's also fun to run into the occasional monster! <cf>Enjoy the thrill of the ride!
What a joke. Ha-ha-ha! <cf>I'm going through the safe part.
Hey, hey, did you hear the one about the priest who can't speak?
A woman says she's from Asterleeds. <cf>She's looking for medicine.
He said the stuff you can get in Jubilia doesn't help. <cf>I feel sorry for him, he can't speak for a long time.
Lalaforte, right? <cf>The priest with the bad throat.
It's hard work, isn't it? You Bapharia priests are <cf>also supposed to sing songs, right?
Is there anything I can do to help?
I emigrated from Salamzart.
The quality of the sunlight is different! <cf>It's just as hot in both cases.
Salamzart is way over his limit~.
It's refreshing here, right by the ocean, and <cf>it doesn't get too cold at night.
Comfort itself! <cf>Hmmm, I'm glad I moved here!
It's almost time for the <cf>Star Festival in Asterleeds!
The "Star Spirit Diva" will take center stage <cf>and dedicate a song to the gods of Bapharia~♪
Everyone in town sings and makes noise... <cf>Many people travel from Jubilia to attend...
I sing a lot in bars and squares too... <cf>Bapharia ~~ to our ~~ God~~!
More and more people are coming to live here.
It used to be just a lonely fishing village with a few potholes. <cf>It wasn't a place for trading ships to come.
It used to have an atmosphere similar to the forest where we live, but now <cf>it's too busy to resemble it.
Hmm?　Are you interested in the forest? <cf>Our hometown is much deeper than that.
It's called Koaniani Forest. <cf>It's an old forest where the forest people have lived since ancient times.
Here in Jubilia, there is no building that can be called a temple <cf>
The Bapharia religion has long been rooted in the <cf>What a small number of people there were.
We had to build an altar to enshrine them.
Recently, more and more people have moved from Asterleeds, <cf>making it necessary to preach the teachings of Bapharia once again!
As I said, I am also a person sent by Asterleeds. <cf>I must fulfill my mission without shame to God.
I'm not saying it's as good as Asterleeds, but <cf>I'd love to see a fine temple built here as well!
I was asked to escort Mr. Hugo, <cf>I came all the way from my home country ......
As soon as you take your eyes off them for a second, they are gone! <cf>And he is talking to women from one end to the other!
This is no escort, at all.
Yeah, we're still searching again. <cf>If you guys find them too, could you let me know?
Poppoppo~♪ Nappoppo~♪
What's wrong?　A talking nappo is rare?
If you are a nappo koud na chisei, <cf>you can manipulate human language and other zousa!
[I'm not sure what that means. <cf>I'm not sure what it means.
Nappo originally lived on this continent <cf>near humans.
So I can speak the language normally.
But I hear that the Nappo who crossed over to the Magna continent <cf>gradually became more and more wild.
They stopped talking, and some of them even turned purple <cf>and started napping to do bad things to humans.
Recently, I've been seeing some bad nappos here on the continent. <cf>You should be careful if you meet them.
This is "Pupu House". <cf>It's a popular guesthouse in Jubilia.
Not just human tourists, but <cf>forest folk living together too!
Sometimes we have forest people's food on the table. <cf>It's a popular way to experience different cultures.
It's a home where everyone can feel safe and secure, without any boundaries between races. <cf>What do you think?　I recommend Pupu House!
There's a woman staying here, <cf>she looks really sick.
At first I was mad because he didn't even say hi to me. <cf>But I guess I didn't really have a voice.
I just had a bad thought. <cf>I wonder if I could deliver something to you that would be medicinal.
Do you like heights! <cf>Do you feel romantic!
We are Team Highlanders! <cf>We are a team of adventurers who continue to aim high!
When I say heights, I don't mean ideological heights! <cf>Literally, we only seek the high ground, and we seek it earnestly!
You came all the way here, and you have the qualities to reach great heights! <cf>Let's reach the top together!
(That guy I Accepted the commission with ...... <cf>I haven't heard from him in a long time.)
(I figured I wouldn't screw it up because it's a good arm <cf>I may never ...... come back)
Regular cleaning is important to maintain the water quality of Kirei Pond <cf>!
Schedule the next cleaning!
I've come to know ...... <cf>that once your body turns another color, it's your last.
If my body turns purple <cf>do me a favor ......
......っぽ
I'm managing the hot springs here, I guess!
I've been personally appointed by the Queen as <cf>administrator!
Oh!　Adventurers! <cf>We, the Gilwet troupe, are getting down to business.
We have decided to make this place, Salamzart Oasis, a full-fledged <cf>troupe base!
May our diva Charlotte give <cf>the best performance possible!
As Salamzart's best traveling troupe of entertainers, <cf>we will continue to devote our efforts to you and look forward to your continued patronage!
We often go to the [outer continent] <cf>to preach the Bapharia religion. ......
They have their own beliefs over there, too. <cf>It's hard to penetrate as much as you'd like.
Didn't you think that the Seirei Festival was <cf>amazing?
That was one of the best star festivals I've seen in <cf>history!
I'm thinking ...... if we can have another mind-blowing star festival, and I'm asking <cf>if I can become a priest and be involved in the star festival.
I'm looking forward to the next Star Festival. <cf>I can't wait!
The dragon tribe has appeared again!　And this time, near the township!
If you just want to fly above the ground, you can still do so at ......
Anyway, could you please report to JoOusama and suggest <cf>that we strengthen our vigilance in the forest?
There's no reason to stop if it's a baptismal one, <cf>Go ahead and pass.
The defeatists are causing a commotion, <cf>turn the soldiers towards the museum!
Another defeatist! <cf>Please visit ...... at this busy time of the year!
Leave the [sato] to us. <cf>Make some noise and get the queens' attention.
To get to the "Graveyard of Spirits" <cf>you need to go through the "Tuonela Path" up ahead.
Go there first. <cf>Soon the security will be thin.
Now go!　I'm asking you!
The defeatists! <cf>Where did they go?
Dad ...... security, be careful <cf>don't get hurt.
(I thought you said you could be <cf>friendly with this human ......)
(She said he'd be fine <cf>, didn't she?)
If you're going to "Graveyard of Spirits," get there early. ......
The dragon tribe is ...... during ......
Thanks for taking care of the dragon tribe.
The dragon tribe has left, but <cf>we must remain vigilant.
The dragon tribe is heading to the "Graveyard of Spirits"!
Hurry up!
No one is allowed into this Ulrau Village without permission.
Especially if you're a ...... human being.
This is what my grandfather ...... <cf>told me.
Our ancestors used their geographical advantage <cf>to drive the Bapharia gods out into the outside world.
Jeez, ...... I never get tired of that story again. ......
(Based on the technology of Bapharia in the lore, <cf>isn't that a quintessential ......?)
Didn't you say the other day that 'humans fought together'?
The story of Ojiji is a lie Happi~~~!
What do you mean by 'geographical advantage'?
Aw, I'm glad you're talking to me.
I've been told I'm an old woman who knows things. <cf>I'll tell you one of the oddest sayings I've ever heard.
From the "Graveyard of Spirits" were born not only our ancestors, but <cf>the ancestors of all the peoples who inhabit this continent.
And ...... that from that ancestor came the forest people, the dragon people, <cf>the god people of Bapharia, you know the story.
It looks so different. <cf>I know it's a lie. Pretty interesting story, isn't it?
I've heard that you've been seeing a lot of dragon people lately. ...... <cf>security, have a safe trip!
You too, today is the day to pick nuts, right?
Give thanks to the ancestral spirits and the blessings of the forest, <cf>and don't forget to cook the incense for the prayer.
(kun kun ......)
Humans smell ...... something different, don't they?
(kun kun ...... <cf>I still feel at home with my own smell ......)
Wah [woah]!
I'm an Accepted Baptist [-]!
Accepted baptism in the woods.
Some years ago, Accepted humans were living in <cf>[township (sato)]...
You went back to Asterleeds.
He showed me so many unusual things <cf>It's amazing what the outside world is like!　I thought.
……………………
In my head, I know you're not like <cf>those guys.
I don't want to talk to humans.
Did you see the wholesale woodsmen in Jubilia?
That's my brother. <cf>He's so uptight about customer service. ......
I really wish I could go, but I'm directionally challenged. <cf>Once I get out of the woods, I can't come back, hahaha!
I used to sneak in some deals at <cf>forest a while back.
Once the dragon tribe started showing up, the deal got cut off.
Oh, and don't tip off the queen that we brothers are secretly doing business with <cf>!　Hahaha!
To ......, it's Ningen: ......
I thought you said that the Goddess of Mercy said that <cf>you shouldn't have anything to do with ...... people. ......
Oh, ...... if you get close to a human ...... <cf>he'll take your tail!
I know, right? ......
There used to be a girl who liked to sing. <cf>[She left the township.
I wonder what he's doing now that he's gone to where the humans live ...... <cf>
Do you see that beautiful, flowery, big tree?
That is the place where our ancestral spirits are found. <cf>It's called "Meiju".
When we die, we too will become ancestral spirits and go to our ancestral tree <cf>to watch over this [village].
All the good water in the world can be found at <cf>
There is no better water in the world than the water in Koaniani Forest <cf>!
What's the latest fad?
What, you're not from Jubilia? <cf>All humans look alike, I can't understand you at all!
Nappo is a nappo with a queen.
Have you ever made your queen angry? <cf>When she gets angry, she's as scary as an ogre.
Oh!　I remember the last time I covered JoOusama with water and made her <cf>fall down.
I was scared even then. <cf>I was smiling, but my eyes weren't smiling!
(BUZZING)
There is a legend that there are scary creatures in the forest. <cf>If you encounter one, you will die without ever waking up again.
So when you go outside [the township], <cf>you always go outside with an adult.
Come on, touch my ear and I promise you.
This is Ulrau Village, where the forest people live.
It may be unusual for humans, <cf>but we use very little of our Bapharia heritage here.
The trees of the forest are connected to [Meiju] ......
Houses and furniture made from those trees can also be <cf>[life tree] stock.
We always feel the warmth of the tree of life.
...... this branch and ...... <cf>that branch looks ok ......
Listen, we have a mission to protect the forest. <cf>We must take good care of it.
Up this hill is the Queen's mansion. <cf>Please do not be disrespectful.
I've been to ....... I can smell it from you <cf>that you've been undercover through all the battles of the past.
Have you ever seen the ......? <cf>Creepy creatures roaming the depths of the forest.
I've seen it before, but I was so scared I ran away. <cf>Maybe you can do something about it. ......
Shhh!
I'm listening to the doctor. <cf>Don't talk to me!

Examination Advice
It's your first adventurer rank-up battle. <lf>Well then, I have some advice for you.
Remember the adventurer registration test. <lf>I'm sure you made the right equipment to help you in battle.
First, weapons. Don't forget to equip yourself with the "Adventures" series at <lf>
And Enhance Imagine. <lf>Are you equipped with the "E-URI Uribo"?
Oh yeah, you could also use Battle Imagine. <lf>'B-Goblin' or anything else for that matter.
Now all we have to do is look around and <lf>make good use of what we can use.
The <lf>Pioneer Bureau's examinations are not so lenient that you can easily get through them by brute force, you know?
Make sure you are well prepared and ready for the show. <lf>We're rooting for you, too. Good luck!
For this rank-up battle, <lf>, the key is to "increase your fainting resistance."
It's important to equip the appropriate Enhance Imagine and <lf>reduce the occurrence of "stunned".
I've got a <lf>"Increased Fainting Resistance" on my "E-Far Asterleeds".
And I'd also recommend equipping a second Enhance Imagine to boost your <lf>abilities.
I don't care what Enhance Imagine you use, <lf>just make sure it's as effective as possible.
I'd also equip two Battle Imagines if you can. <lf>I think it'll make the fight a lot smoother.
Many adventurers stumble especially because of "fainting," so <lf>be sure to take all possible countermeasures!
This is where your adventures are put to the test. <lf>Make the most of what you've got.
In this rank-up battle, <lf>you'll need to be prepared for "Paralysis".
Like the last Ranked Battle, <lf>there's an Enhance Imagine that increases Resistance.
Paralysis Resistance is on <lf>"E- Flocking Flying Kagachiyanma."
You'd better equip this Enhance Imagine before you try <lf>rank-up battles.
If possible, I'd like to have enough Enhance Imagine to equip all five symbols <lf>
And don't forget the weapons. <lf>You can use the "Passage of the Gods" series.
Be especially careful of abnormalities. <lf>The monsters will get tougher from here on out, so get used to it.
For this rank-up battle, <lf>"Earth Element Resistance" and "Poison Resistance" will be the key.
First of all, "E - The End of the Dry Wind". <lf>This has the effect of "Increasing Earth Element Resistance".
And "E - The Revealed Menace, The Roar of the Long Ago". <lf>This one is needed for "Increase Poison Resistance".
If you're getting it, I'd also recommend <lf>"The Value of E-Handmade."
Because of its "Damage Received Reduction" effect, <lf>it is an effective Imagine, not only in rank-up battles.
I'd prefer the "Remnants of Silence" series of weapons. <lf>It might be tough without that much power.
First of all, control the damage you Accept <lf>well and don't fall down.
And to attack to win the battle. <lf>You have to be aware of both in a balanced way.
This time it's said to be one of the most difficult rank-up battles. <lf>Show us what you're made of. I'm counting on you!
How's the adventure board going? <lf>I hope it's going well.
Don't just raise your adventurer rank, <lf>try all kinds of adventures!
I think it's fun because the more you accomplish, the more <lf>rewards you get!
When the rank-up battle happens, <lf>give me a shout again!
This test is all about "fatigue." Try equipping the arrowhead's <lf>"E- Sedentary Soldier M Mook".
Congratulations!　You've reached Adventurer Rank 10. <lf>You can now challenge for higher ranks in Rush Battle!
Congratulations!　You've reached Adventurer Rank 11. <lf>You may be able to conquer even the most difficult adventures!
In this rank-up battle, <lf>a "hauling gimmick" has been introduced.
The trick is to carry the key item to the pedestal and manipulate it so that <lf>you can move on!
You'll be consuming Stamina during transport, so keep an eye on your <lf>Stamina level!
When you run out of Stamina, you'll go into a state of 'Fatigue'. <lf>Don't forget to "Increase Resistance to Fatigue" because it is a trap.
If you equip the "E-Sedentary Soldier M Mook" you should be able to get the benefits of <lf>"Fatigue Resistance"
And use weapons appropriate to your level.
It's important to manage your Stamina, even in battle. <lf>As an adventurer, I want you to have a broad perspective.
Congratulations!　Your Adventurer rank is now 12. <lf>Keep up the good work and explore the wide world!
In this ranked battle, <lf>they've introduced a gimmick that brings about a "Bind" condition.
You're literally stuck in Bind and you can't move. <lf>You have to have a plan in place to get through it.
It has the "Anti-Bind" ability <lf>and it's a must to equip Enhance Imagine.
The Surface of E-Lawehala is so <lf>that you must first create this before you can take the test.
With "E - Dunkirk's Stiff Strike of Defeat" <lf>I'll have an increased Resistance to Fire Element, which will make things easier.
Weapons should be from the series that can be made in the "Valley of the Coral Rocks". <lf>At least that's what I'm looking for.
You have to deal with special situations calmly. <lf>That is the proof of an adventurer's ability.
It's important that you deal with the "Bind" condition in this exam. <lf>Don't forget the "Surface of E-Lawehala" by Mitsuba.
Congratulations!　You have reached the highest Adventurer rank. <lf>You are now one of the top adventurers!
Here are some of the most skilled and talented players in the world! <lf>Take care of Arena!

Interested in Aegis Fighter?
If you're up for it, give me a shout. <cf>I'll teach you how to fight Aegis Fighter.
Are you interested in what I have to say? <cf>I'm flattered.
Let me introduce myself again. My name is Kors. <cf>I've been an Aegis Fighter for quite a while there.
I use my experience to teach the young guys how to fight Aegis Fighter <cf>
I'm hoping that by doing so, I'll have one more friend I can count on <cf>
Since we're here, you're going to have to listen to some of it too. <cf>Even if it's something you know, it should be worth reviewing.
However, it would be boring to just talk. <cf>Let's do it while we're working on the request.
The request is to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Let's get out of town for now. We'll talk about the rest there.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Let's go to defeat the <cf>We'll meet up outside the city first.
Alright. Before we go to battle, <cf>let's do a quick recap.
The one thing an Aegis Fighter must care about more than anything else is <cf>. That's shield handling.
The shield is the symbol of the Aegis Fighter. <cf>Protecting your allies is also what this shield is all about.
We also have swords. Of course, attack is important. <cf>But we must not neglect defense.
When you fight the enemy, be aware that you're not only attacking, <cf>you're also protecting yourself, using shields to prevent and defend yourself.
However, if you keep on the defensive, you will lose one day. <cf>You must defend and look for opportunities to attack.
If you weave your skills into the mix, <cf>you'll have a more Aegis Fighter-like fight.
All right. Let's actually fight then. <cf>Let's get to work on the request <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>to take them down.
I'm going over there to take them down. <cf>I'll join you here when I'm done. Call me again.
You actually have to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>You need a balanced combination of offense and defense.
We'll meet back here when we're done.
Thanks, guys. That was a nice touch. <cf>You didn't need me to tell you.
Shield and sword handling. How to use your skills. <cf>That would make it easier to work with your friends.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Was that not enough for you? <cf>Ha-ha-ha!　Then I'm sorry.
The most important thing for ...... Aegis Fighter is to <cf>protect what needs to be protected!
We must fight for it. <cf>Put the will to protect into the shield and swing the sword.
It's easy to say, but difficult to maintain that attitude. <cf>But I know you'll be fine.
You're a lot more ...... than I am.
I'm glad to have a friend I can count on. <cf>I look forward to working with you from now on.
Thanks to you, I think I've remembered my original intentions. <cf>After all, we shouldn't neglect the basics.
Next time, please fight with me. <cf>Let's try a more difficult request.
When you've honed your skills and become more confident in your abilities, <cf>please ask me again.
I'll make sure I'm properly trained too. <cf>Well then, don't forget me. See you soon.
Do you continue to work out?
When you learn something new, go back to the basics.
That's what's important.
How's the Aegis Fighter training going?
When you get used to it, we'll fight together again. <cf>There's a lot more to learn from the two of us.
Will you take care of it? I'd be very grateful.
This time, I've nominated Aegis Fighter for the job. <cf>Sometimes these things happen.
The request was to defeat a monster in Minsterhorn. <cf>This in itself is not an unusual request.
But if you're dealing with a belligerent guy, <cf>it's tricky when he comes at you.
We want to be on the defensive in case of an emergency. <cf>That's when Aegis Fighter is called in.
The people of Minsterhorn, as well as the fields and farms, will be protected. <cf>That's what you're asking us to do, with that kind of expectation.
It's the Aegis Fighter's show of skill.
First, let's go talk to <cf>to see what kind of monsters are out there.
It seems that the monsters have been sighted mainly on farms. <cf>My client should be waiting for them there.
Well, then, let's go all the way to Minsterhorn.
Let's go to Minsterhorn for a talk.
You are the Aegis Fighter who came to us with a request. <cf>Thank you for your time and effort.
No, of course not. <cf>Can we get right to it?
I've heard that our bad monsters are showing up more often these days <cf>......
Yes, I have seen this. I've seen <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>hanging around the area too!
Fortunately, our fields have not been damaged yet. <cf>However, it seems to be attacking livestock and people.
We've already had a few injuries, too. <cf>I'm worried that they will eventually get here ......
I see. Sure, maybe they'll set their sights on this field <cf>next.
Are they after vegetables or ....... No, based on his behavior so far <cf>, he's still likely to attack people.
The damage has already been done. <cf>It's best to take them down quickly.
Leave it to me. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Me and this guy can take care of him.
I'd be in trouble if someone else was being a pain in the ass.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Is it possible to have monsters other than <cf>?
Suddenly, vicious monsters can appear. <cf>They come and go as they please. They come and go at any time and place.
I've met those monsters before ......
......?　Is something wrong? <cf>You sounded a little gloomy.
No, it's nothing. Sorry. <cf>It's none of my business right now.
I'm going to go to the street first and see what's going on. <cf>Can you follow me, too?
...... that Aegis Fighter, <cf>he's a little shady.
What, did you have a bitter memory? <cf>I may have said something bad.
I'm sorry. I'm just being very blunt. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Thank you for your help in defeating them.
Kors has been checking <cf>for traces of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
You should be at the "Adventurers' Encampment" <cf>, so why don't you join us once?
You're here. I've checked the area a bit. <cf>No doubt, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and the others left their footprints.
If we take down these guys around here, <cf>we should be able to limit further damage.
We don't want to get too close to the village if possible. <cf>I'd like to control the battle lines well.
Defense with shields is the cornerstone of the Aegis Fighter. <cf>But if you keep defending, one day you will run out of power.
You have to prevent them from attacking you, limit their movement while <cf>taking advantage of the opening and turning it into an attack.
You can protect something and also attack it at the same time. <cf>That's what an Aegis Fighter is all about.
......Yes. We fight while we defend.
Come on, let's protect Minsterhorn and the people! <cf>Let's split up.
We'll take down the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>guys at each other's posts. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet up again around here.
Let's go to <cf>and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>".
When you're done, we'll meet here. <cf>We will fight to defend Minsterhorn!
Good job. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Looks like you kicked the crap out of them.
I'll be fine. <cf>Now they'll stay away from the village.
I knew you were a good Aegis Fighter. <cf>I was able to protect what I needed to protect. I can count on you.
......What? <cf>Do I look like I care about anything?
...... I just have a little memory of <cf>something called a monster attacking a village.
With you, someday ......
[--] No. Sorry, it's nothing. <cf>Just listen.
If you ever ask me for help again, I need your help. <cf>I want to see you, Aegis Fighter.
To me, it's dazzling. <cf>Like a lost treasure somewhere. ......
So far, you haven't accepted any <cf>requests that would require your help.
But I'll need your help in the near future: ......
I kind of have a feeling about that.
Hey, how are you doing?
And don't forget to review your equipment. <cf>For us, shields are our very lifeline.
Hey, how are you? <cf>If you want, you can help me with my request.
The idea is to deliver <cf>"High Helm Beans" to a merchant in Larpal.
I think they need something from me after that, too. <cf>I'm going to need some help.
I don't think it's going to be rough. ...... <cf>Either way, it would be nice to have you along for the ride.
First of all, there's the "High Helm Beans". <cf>You can collect them at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland.
When you have collected the required number, go to Larpal. <cf>Deliver them to the client merchant.
Let's collect <cf>"High Helm Beans" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland!
Are you the adventurer who Accepted our request? <cf>You brought us "High Helm Beans."
Oh, yes. <cf>For the first one you asked for, I'm pretty sure that's it.
I'm told there are other jobs out there?
Yes, I'm a foodie. I'm the one who collects and <cf>sells all the food around here!
I'd like to stock up on something else: <cf>I'd like to get some "red calla grass" which is a spice: ......
Actually, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>will be on a street close to where you are collecting!
So, I decided to ask for a skilled adventurer <cf>
I see. I guess we need to both collect "Akakara Grass" and defeat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>
Can you please do that for me? <cf>I'd like to leave soon if possible. ......
You mean urgency. <cf>I understand. Then let's split up and take care of it.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>Can I leave it to you to take down the <cf>I'm going to go and get some "Akakara Grass" while I'm at it.
The place they leave is ...... " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>"? <cf>It's on the road to Litze.
In any case, we can't just leave them there. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>We'll take care of it.
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" and take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>.
You're not the guy to beat, but be careful. <cf>I'll take care of the "akakara grass" collection for you.
Oh, adventurers! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>You have defeated the
Oh. This guy did a great job. <cf>As you can see, we were able to collect the "red calla grass" as well.
Well, thank you again and again. <cf>It helps.
As you've heard, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>is no longer available, so <cf>I think you're safe on your way home!
How about you?
This is the person who delivered the food from Litze. <cf>He was here a while ago.
I was having trouble getting back to <cf>because of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>on the street!
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks to you, I can go back to Litze.
Um, ....... <cf>You guys are Aegis Fighter, right?
That's right. <cf>We're both Aegis Fighter.
Aegis Fighter used to be ....... <cf>That man was also an Aegis Fighter. ......
...... Hey, you, do I know you from somewhere? <cf>You look familiar to me. ......
Huh?　Oh, ......! <cf>No, I thought it was my imagination. ......
Um, I'm sorry. <cf>I'll leave you to it.
Well, it's time for me to go. <cf>Thank you both so much for your time!
From the time of Litze's youth ......, it would be ....... <cf>...... No, no way.
When I was starting out, I fought some of the <cf>monsters that attacked settlements.
But I couldn't take that guy down. <cf>I was alone and immature. ......
If I'd had a buddy like you then <cf>the outcome might have been different.
That's why I'm glad I got to work with you this time and help <cf>people!
If I ever need anything else, I need your help. <cf>Keep up the good work.
Thanks for the other day. <cf>Your growth has been remarkable.
If only I had a partner like you back then. ...... <cf>No, it's not worth mentioning. Forget it.
Looks like we have a request from Litze.
I've been thinking a little bit about ....... <cf>Shall I Accept or not? ......
I've got a request from a resident of Litze. <cf>I need your help again.
Suspicious persons have been seen around the village.
Nothing has happened yet. <cf>But people in the village are getting anxious.
Remember the story of how I, a fledgling ...... before, missed the <cf>monster?
It was <cf>Ritze who was being attacked by the monster at that time.
They asked me to kill the monsters and protect the village. <cf>I couldn't fulfill their request. ......
I haven't been to Litze since then. <cf>I feel guilty and I can't help it. ......
But we can't keep saying that forever. <cf>There are people out there who need help this way.
You're the one who made me feel that way. <cf>With you, I know I can protect Litze this time.
I'm like this, but I need your help.
Let's hear what's going on in Litze first.
Suspicious individuals have been seen around Litze.
Let's go talk first. <cf>Litze is a village in the Montegnor Valley.
Huh? <cf>You guys met before in Larpal: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>This is the adventurer who took down the <cf>Thank you for that time.
You are the young man who was delivering foodstuffs to the merchant. <cf>We've just Accepted your request.
I just got word that a suspicious person has been seen in Litze.
You guys accepted the request.
What I saw was a suspicious man. <cf>He is walking around the village and peeking into houses.
I don't live in the village. I don't know anyone. <cf>I try to talk to them, but they run away.
But they're back and hanging around the village. <cf>Not that they did anything to me. ......
That's definitely suspicious. <cf>All right. Let's find the guy first.
There must be others who witnessed it. <cf>Let's talk to the villagers.
There's a suspicious man hanging around Ritze.
I'm sure there are others who have seen it besides me. <cf>Listen to what everyone else has to say.
A suspicious man roaming around the village? <cf>Yeah, I saw him too.
I'm not one to judge people by their looks, but <cf>he's kind of a dark, shadowy guy.
The times we see them are all over the place.
They hang around no matter what time of day, morning, noon or night. <cf>My buddy said he saw them too, so I'm pretty sure.
Is there that much to see in this village?
I see what you mean. ....... <cf>Sounds like you're not just a traveler, or a mere traveler.
They are walking around the village very carefully. <cf>It is as if he is checking on us.
That man might be there. <cf>Let's look around the village some more.
Suspicious men have been spotted at various times.
Maybe they're still looking in on the village? <cf>If so, I don't like it. ......
Hey, what? <cf>I'm not anything fishy. ......
[--]!　You are ...... Kors! <cf>You're Kors, the Aegis Fighter!
You know me?
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean: ......
The guy who ran away before the monster. <cf>What the hell do you want with Ritze now!
Thanks to you I lost my farm! <cf>Now I'm sneaking around the village snooping around ......
It's your fault that this happened! <cf>Damn you, you are an abomination!
...... that guy, probably one of the bandits.
They fled toward the mountains. <cf>Over there is where the riffraff gather.
They were probably checking out the village and looking for an opportunity to raid <cf>
We'd better get a move on before they make their move.
We will defeat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>that appears in " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"!
We have to get ahead of them before they attack the village. <cf>When we're done, we'll report back to our client, the young man.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Did you find out who that suspicious man was?
...... A gang of bandits? <cf>So that's why you were looking in on the village?
<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>has been defeated, right? <cf>Then, good. Thank you.
I couldn't find that guy, but <cf>alone shouldn't be able to do anything else.
Just ...... that guy, he knew me. <cf>Looks like he used to live in Litze.
He said he lost his farm because of me.
A resident of Litze? <cf>That's why they lost their fields because of you. ......
...... I see! <cf>Anta, you're the Aegis Fighter from back then!
He went to take down the monster that attacked the village and <cf>ran away!
'I'll protect you all.' <cf>You promised me that, too. ......
Dang!　I remember ....... <cf>You're that boy. ......
We were betrayed by Anta!
The village was razed to the ground and the houses and fields were a mess. <cf>Litze was almost destroyed that time!
Kors. Are you still an adventurer? <cf>You couldn't protect us!
<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>It doesn't erase <cf>your past just because you did something about it!
I'm sorry ....... <cf>I got you into this. ......
Hey, can you accompany me to the outskirts of the village? <cf>It's too public to talk here.
Hey, can you accompany me to the outskirts of the village?
If I talk here, I'll be in the public eye. <cf>Because there will be other people who know who I am.
This place used to be a farm. <cf>Looks abandoned now.
This is the scar of what I've done: ......
When I was a fledgling adventurer, <cf>there was a monster that attacked Litze.
I was contracted to take it down, but I ...... <cf>didn't think I could compete, so I ran away.
At that time, there was a child who promised to protect the village. <cf>That must be the young man.
I didn't mean to lie about my promise. <cf>But as it turns out, I'm a big liar. ......
Then I kept turning away from Litze.
I Accepted this request because <cf>I knew I had to face my past.
But I still don't know what I can do: ......
I deserve to be resented. <cf>I don't know how to make amends for that.
But if something happens to Ritze, <cf>that's when I will try to clear my name.
Sorry for the heavy talk. <cf>I just thought you should know.
If I ever get a chance to make amends, <cf>I'd be glad to have your help too!
I'm gathering information on Litze right now.
If something happens, <cf>I will definitely try to make amends for the past.
If you do, I need your help.
I think we're getting a little more requests in the Montegnor Valley area.
Thanks, I don't like it. ...... <cf>I hope it's just my imagination.
You're helping me, thank you. <cf>There's nothing more reassuring than your help.
When I was starting out, I ran away <cf>from the monsters that attacked Ritze, as I told you before.
It was an ogre called "The Flaming Hell.
Not sure what happened to him after he ravaged Litze. <cf>No one has seen him or heard of him being taken down.
[--]Until the other day, nah.
An ogre was spotted in the vicinity of Litze. <cf>Its characteristics are very similar to the "Flaming Hell".
He's back again. <cf>...... doesn't sound like it to me.
I have always regretted it. <cf>I have to face my mistakes.
That's what I've been fighting for as an Aegis Fighter <cf>
Let's hurry to Litze. <cf>We need to find out who the Ogre is.
If it's the "Flaming Hell", I'll beat it this time. <cf>If not, I will protect Ritze!
Come with me. Partner!
Let's hurry to Litze. <cf>We need to hear more about the ogre that showed up.
If it's "Flaming Hell", I'll beat it this time. <cf>If not, we will protect Ritze!
Kors!　You're here again. <cf>What do you want this time?
I heard that an ogre that looks like "Flaming Hell" has appeared.
We'll take them down. <cf>I'd like to hear the details.
Now?　You ran away once.
No matter what you do, <cf>we will not forgive your betrayal!
I can't apologize enough for running away from "Flaming Hell" before <cf>I can't apologize enough ......
Still ...... no, that's why! <cf>I just couldn't sit idly by this time.
This time, I will surely defeat the "Flaming Hell". <cf>Please give me a chance.
I think the ogre that showed up at ...... is "Flaming Hell". <cf>Everyone says there's no doubt about it.
But I heard it was a size bigger than it used to be. <cf>I was a kid, so I don't remember for sure.
It's grown bigger. ...... <cf>Does that mean they've grown and gained strength?
It may be so. <cf>Kors. You didn't even stand a chance in the old "Flaming Hell".
And you still think you can beat them? <cf>Do you really think you can protect the village?
...... me and this guy can take them down.
We'll protect Litze. <cf>Trust Aegis Fighter.
I don't even know the detailed location where the ...... auger will be. <cf>You'll have to ask someone else.
Believe it or not, <cf>you guys are the only ones I can count on here right now.
Ok. Thank you.
Let's ask where the Ogre appears. <cf>There must be someone out there who knows.
There must be someone somewhere in the village who knows where the ogre appears <cf>
You are the only ones we can count on. <cf>Please ......
Kors!　You, you're here again!
You are the bandit from the other day! <cf>You're the one who's still in Litze. ......
The bandits went out of business. <cf>You guys took down my people.
Well, ....... <cf>Hey, did you live in this village?
Yeah, that's right. The physiognomy changed. <cf>No one in the village noticed, though.
That time ...... after you escaped. <cf>The "Flaming Hell" attacked our village.
Fields were razed, houses were destroyed ...... <cf>and the village was a mess. My fields too.
I couldn't live like that. <cf>I left the village and wandered from place to place. ......
I found myself a part of a bandit gang.
But that's also the end of it, thanks to you guys. <cf>Well, maybe ...... that's the only good thing about it.
I was trying to figure out what to do now, and I heard <cf>["]I saw a big ogre ["].
I thought maybe "Flaming Hell" had reappeared.
I couldn't help but notice ...... <cf>I'm back on the Ritze again!
I heard about it and came here too. <cf>This time, I'm going to defeat the "Flaming Hell".
I'm not the guy I was then. <cf>Besides, now I have friends I can count on.
Leave the "Flaming Hell" to us.
...... You're serious. Kors.
The "Flaming Hell" is in the "Melisos River Basin". <cf>I saw the footprints. I'm sure of it.
[--]Thank you.
Let's go. The "Flaming Hell" is a formidable enemy. <cf>But we can't run away this time.
Fight with me! <cf>To protect Litze [--]!
The "Flaming Hell" is in the "Melisos River Basin".
They are going to attack Litze again. <cf>The rest is up to you, Aegis Fighter.
There he is. ....... The Flaming Hell.
...... Damn, my hands are shaking at this stage ......
I know. <cf>I still can't shake the illusion of the past.
What makes "Flaming Hell" look bigger than it needs to be is <cf>my own weak heart.
But [--]I can't let my inadequacy <cf>get the people of Litze into trouble again!
And I can't let you <cf>see any more embarrassment, either.
Here we go. The time to fight is now!
I am Kors, Aegis Fighter! <cf>I'm coming to you with my friends to whom I can entrust myself!
......Yay! ......
We did it!　We defeated the "Flaming Hell"!
Haha ......!　You did it, thank you! <cf>You fought with me, and I'm glad you did!
Now the "Flaming Hell" will no longer attack the village. <cf>This time, protecting people has been achieved. ......
I don't know how to thank you enough for all you've done for me.
Oh, I can't stay like this. <cf>Let's go back to Litze and tell the young man.
[It's all right now. <cf>Aegis Fighter has delivered on its promise.
I will go back to Litze and tell that young man.
The "Flaming Hell" has been defeated. <cf>Ritze is all right now.
You guys are safe!
You've beaten "Flaming Hell". <cf>This time, you really have to go to ......!
Yeah, I got him down.
I'm not sure that running away in the past has <cf>been written off. ......
Still, they kept the promise they made to me back then. <cf>I'm still glad. ......
What a tearjerker. ......
...... Oh, yeah. I heard you saw that bandit guy again <cf>who was hanging around the village before. ......
Yeah, we met. <cf>It's okay. He's not going to do anything else.
I'll have to talk to that guy too. <cf>We'll never truly settle the past.
Just hang out with me a little longer. <cf>Let's find that guy.
You finally fulfilled your promise to defeat the "Flaming Hell" <cf>
Thank you. <cf>Tell that bandit guy to pass the word.
Even that one looks like it used to be a resident of this village.
Kors! <cf>You beat "Flaming Hell"!
Oh. This guy's been cooperating with us.
I didn't expect the Aegis Fighter that got away to come back to <cf>slay the monster. ......
I kept <cf>Aegis Fighter going for that.
One day, I will face my past and <cf>get over it.
I couldn't believe it on words alone, but after what we've done ...... <cf>, it's hard not to believe it!
That's quite a feat, you guys!
What are you going to do now?
Yeah, ...... I'll start over too. <cf>I'll plow the fields again.
See you later. Come back to this village. <cf>Aegis Fighter!
Thank you. <cf>I got to step out of my regrets.
Aegis Fighter on a higher plane <cf>because you were with me.
You didn't just protect Ritze. <cf>You protected my heart, too.
The desire to protect and fight for something: ......
That ambition is what Aegis Fighter needs most <cf>
I could certainly sense that strong feeling from you.
I, too, could embrace that feeling again. <cf>[Thank you so much!
Hey, how are you doing? <cf>Do you see what you need to protect?
Sometimes I just want to fight with you again. <cf>Because you're the best partner I've ever had.
Are you interested in Twin Striker?
Let's fight with other Twin Strikers who are also Twin Strikers. <cf>If we learn how to fight together, we'll be stronger!
Yo, I'm Manuel. <cf>I'm the guy who will be the hero of Twin Striker!
I'm still planning to go to ....... Haha!
Twin Striker hero Achim!　You know what? <cf>I wanna be like that guy!
A legendary hero who turned a hopeless situation <cf>in a battle against the dragon tribe long ago with his overwhelming strength!
People call him "The First Twin Striker"! <cf>Kaa!　That's awesome... I adore it!
According to this "Hero Compendium," <cf>the hero Achim was born where Litze is now.
I used to be a lumberjack, but <cf>the dragon tribe killed my wife and child and I threw myself into the fight.
Later, when he moved to the West Bernhardt Peninsula, he fought a tremendous war and <cf>the king at the time referred to him as ......
...... is so!　I had made a request!
Sorry!　I get so excited when I talk about ahim. <cf>My friends often warn me about it.
My friend came down with a stomach ache. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>I was going to take down a friend of mine who had a stomach ache.
We're both Twin Strikers. <cf>We wanted a fellow Twin Striker.
So, I'll take care of it! <cf>Anyhow, let's get out of town first.
I'll be waiting for you when you get out to Asteria Plain. <cf>Just give me a call, okay?　You shouldn't go alone!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Let's go take them down.
I'll be waiting for you just outside the city. <cf>Don't go ahead of me alone, okay?
Hmmm... ....... I see.......... <cf>Right, left...... turn around...... and now up......
...... hmm?　Oh, it's you! <cf>I've been waiting for you. Are you ready?
I was just doing a little Twin Striker instructional <cf>on how to fight.
According to the book, <cf>"The key to Twin Striker is to keep attacking!"
'The more you attack, the sharper the axe. <cf>　Don't be afraid to take a step forward and strike the blade!'
......, yes, that's right. <cf>You're right, close combat is the best way to showcase Twin Strikers!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>They said the total number of kills for the "Mere Old Man" is 6. <cf>Let's split up and go take them down 3 at a time.
Meet me here when you're done. <cf>All right!　Let's show them what we're made of, then!
Got the Twin Striker fight down pat? <cf>Then it's a real battle!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>I'm going to go take down a few of them. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet back here!
Ouch. ....... <cf>Oh, it's you. Are you okay?
I'm hurting. I was too aware of the attacker. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>I got hit back from the
I went back and read the instruction book and "The Hero Compendium" <cf>and it says it right.
Not only to attack, but also to evade the enemy's attacks <cf>Twin Striker needs to ......
Oh, I've made a premature decision. <cf>I wonder how long it will be before I'm a hero.
Oh, but you seem fine with it. <cf>Oh, but you seem fine. Those who can defend themselves can do it!
All right!　I'm not giving up after all! <cf>Someday I will definitely become a hero like Achim!
I'll try a more difficult request this time. <cf>You can fight with me, too!　All right?
Yeah, not right now. <cf>Not right now, but when you get good at it.
If you get stronger than you are now, give me a shout again. <cf>I'll practice harder and harder!
I'm looking forward to the next commission! <cf>I'll be waiting for you to come to me!
Oh, it's you! <cf>I'm in training!
Because we want to be heroes! <cf>First, we need to build up our strength, right?
I'll show you what I can do next time!
Twin Striker practice, how's it going?
Let's go back together again! <cf>It was fun fighting with you!
Yo, you're going with the request again. <cf>Thank you!
This time it's a request turned in from "The Roar of the Twin Axes."
You know what it is?　Twin Strikers get together and <cf>work together as a team to help each other out.
I've had a lot of help from my seniors, they've taught me techniques, they've introduced me to places to train, <cf>I've had a lot of help from them too!
And they get requests from pioneer bureaus and stuff. <cf>The one I Accepted <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>was one of them.
I decided to go with that friend of yours. <cf>You see, that guy who couldn't come before because he had a stomach ache.
When I told him about what you did for me instead, he got <cf>all worked up.
["]If you have such strong Twin Striker friends, <cf>I'd definitely like to meet them! ["]"] I'm so excited.
Sorry!　Like my favorite hero story. <cf>I may have exaggerated a bit!
But it's true, I'm buying you! <cf>I'm glad we're working together again!
I've got your share ready for you. <cf>Let me brag about you to my friends!
Then let's meet up at Minsterhorn. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I heard that the "Mere Old Man" went out that way, so...
I'm meeting my friends there. <cf>Each of us will prepare our own items and meet there.
I'll go ahead. <cf>Call me when you're ready. See you later!
Let's go to Minsterhorn. <cf>My friend is meeting me there.
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>Looks like you're ready to go.
But it looks like my friend hasn't shown up yet. <cf>Did that guy have a stomach ache again?
Well, okay. <cf>While we're waiting, I'll tell you the details of the request.
The target is <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>which appears in the direction of "Dragon Claw Valley". <cf>Apparently, their numbers have been increasing lately.
I'm glad you've joined us at <cf>because it seems like we should take down as many of them as possible.
I'm actually kind of looking forward to this request. <cf>I know it's inappropriate, but you know what?
There's a story in the legend of Achim, the hero I'm targeting, about <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>defeating him!
The Twin Striker's instruction book also explains the episode and <cf>how to fight it!
'Even in the midst of a series of attacks, use your axe in an <cf>appropriate manner, taking into account the number and position of the enemy.'
A first-rate warrior is one who can reap a group, aim at an enemy in the air, or <cf>attack as the occasion demands," he said!
Wow, he's still so cool! <cf>I'm going to fight like Achim, the hero!
...... And that guy's late. <cf>I guess we'll just have to wait for the two of us, won't we?
All right. I'm gonna wait a little bit longer before I go. <cf>You go ahead and start <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>taking them down.
The target is <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>outside of "Dragon Claw Valley." <cf>You don't have to go inside, just be careful.
I'm sure we'll be there soon too. <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done!
Let's take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
Go ahead and get started. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet back here!
...... ha
...... Oh, you. Good night. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I guess you're done defeating them.
Yeah. I finished mine, too.
Oh no, I got hit back so hard! <cf>Oh, that hurt!
It's painful, isn't it, the way Twin Strikers fight? <cf>You have to jump right up to the enemy's eye and keep attacking.
So I guess that guy was in ...... pain and suffering too.
Actually, he ...... my friend came over. <cf>But he left without a fight.
I'm quitting the ["]adventurers. It hurts, and I don't want to fight anymore. <cf>　I'm quitting "The Roar of the Twin Axes" too, and I'm going back to the countryside."[/]]......
My friend and I have known each other since childhood, and we came out of the village together. <cf>That's why the shock was so great.
I promised that we would both be amazing heroes. ......
According to ...... "The Hero Compendium" <cf>the hero Achim saves a village that was attacked by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
Then I fought alongside someone who would become a lifelong friend. <cf>...... we were going to be too.
You don't look so sore. <cf>Maybe it's guys like you who will be heroes.
...... can I be a hero?
No, I'm going to be! <cf>If you were a real hero, you wouldn't be making a dent here!
Even the pain of a wound, even the pain of a heart <cf>endures and continues to fight!　That's what a hero looks like!
I'll show him too! <cf>The guy from the countryside who became a real hero!
I'm going to master the art of Twin Striker! <cf>I'll be a warrior as great as you are!
Recreate the legend of the hero Achim! <cf>Oh, oh, oh, oh!　Let's do it!　Let's do it!　Let's do it!
My path as a Twin Striker starts here <cf>!
I'll have to give a proper report to "The Roar of the Twin Axes." <cf>I'm going back to Asterleeds ahead of you.
Sorry to show you how uncool I am! <cf>I'll be seeing you again as a fellow Twin Striker!
Thanks for helping me out! <cr>
I'm not quitting Twin Striker, okay? <cf>I'm going to practice more and be a hero!
Let me fight with you again! <cf>Until then, all you can do is practice!
Yo, are you doing good?
Let's stick to weapons when we get stronger. <cf>We want to use a cool axe, after all!
You know the great Twin Striker?
It's called "Vortex Impact". <cf>That's cool!
Achim, the hero I'm aiming for, used to use <cf>too, of course!
But hey, ....... <cf>Actually, I can't use it yet.
I'm practicing. <cf>I can't seem to get it right. ......
But I want to be a hero! <cf>I want to use the skill of Achim, the man of my dreams!
I need a hand with <cf>so I can use "Vortex Impact."
......What? <cf>You want me to try to learn about the technique first?
That's what I'm talking about!　You're so smart!
Then let's check it out a bit. <cf>Let's go to the stacks upstairs in the Pioneer Station.
There are lots of biographies and biographies of heroes there. <cf>You might even be able to find out about the techniques they used!
Let's go upstairs to the Pioneer Station.
In the big bookcase over there, <cf>there should be a lot of books about heroes!
I think I can find something on this bookshelf. <cf>Let's see if we can find some Twin Striker books!
I'm not sure what you mean by "Vortex Impact," <cf>because it might be written about it!
Okay, there it is! <cf>It's a book about the legend of the hero Achim!
According to this: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>When he fought the <cf>"Vortex Impact," he crushed his enemy.
That's the hero Achim!　Strong!
I don't see a description of the technique itself in the book though. <cf>I'll have to look for another book.
Now I've found a book about the hero Lothar!
Lothar was a hero who fought <cf>goblins throughout his life!
It is said that people have reclaimed land and property stolen by goblins and saved <cf>countless settlements!
And even though they were dealing with goblins, <cf>they had the integrity not to loot and take them down for nothing.
But that's not what I'm talking about. <cf>I'm talking about Vortex Impact!
Hmmm ......
I guess I could use rotal, but <cf>I still don't see any instructions on how to use it or anything.
Is there a book like a textbook on the technique?
......Yes! <cf>Let's ask our senior Twin Strikers!
There are a lot of adventurers here, right? <cf>We'll get someone downstairs to show us the ropes.
Let's ask the senior adventurers on the ground floor.
I'm sure there are people who could use a "Vortex Impact" <cf>
I would like to know how to use <cf>for "Vortex Impact"?
Yes, I'm a twin striker!　I'm a Twin Striker <cf>and I still can't get it to work ......
Well, you're right. ....... <cf>I learned that from my own mentor.
It's not how you do it, it's when you do it effectively. <cf>You already know how the body works.
When you're fighting, ["] here! ["]" moment hits <cf>.
Then it feels like a natural use for it.
I was fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>and it came to me. <cf>I guess once you get it working, you get used to it.
I see... ...... a bachi moment? <cf>Thank you, seniors!
Yeah, good luck. Okay, bye.
The "Vortex Impact" movement is <cf>I know what I'm talking about too. ......
So, all that's left to do is what the seniors were saying about <cf>the moment when it hits.
Oh, by the way, you said seniors were fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>and <cf>, right?
That's what I read in Achim's book and ....... <cf>Perhaps <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>is the key?
Okay, let's give it a try!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>I'm going to go and take down the "Vortex Impact". <cf>I, of course, for "Vortex Impact".
You should try fighting too, and let me know what you feel. <cf>Maybe you'll get a new clue.
You can't beat a too weak ....... <cf>Okay, let's go to ' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>'!
I'm sure we'll find someone responsive there. <cf>Let's see what happens at the garrison of the Order first!
To use "Vortex Impact" <cf>I guess it's best to gain experience in a real battle after all!
Let's fight the Elder Goblins in "Andra Basin." <cf>I'm sure we'll find some tough ones there.
Let's go to the garrison of the Bapharia cult for a start. <cf>From there, we will challenge "Vortex Impact"!
I'm pretty sure there's a camp of goblins in the forests of "Andra Basin" <cf>
I hear the Elder Goblins are hanging around there <cf>
Some of them even go as far as Minsterhorn <cf>
We have "Vortex Impact" practice, but we can't just leave the <cf>monsters out there, can we?
Okay, let's start taking down the Elder Goblins! <cf>Meet us back here when you're done!
I'll decide!　Vortex Impact!
Let's split up and take down the Elder Goblins in this area <cf>
I'm going to practice "Vortex Impact". <cf>You can try it, too, if you like.
I'd appreciate it if you could give me a sense of what you're feeling. <cf>We'll meet back here when you're done!
Yo, good job! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>You've taken down the
Of course, I've been taking down guns, too!
Did you make "Vortex Impact"? <cf>That's what I'm talking about. ......
I think I had a feeling like that, but not ....... <cf>Hmmm, but it still didn't ring a bell.
The technique didn't work after all.
...... Okay, I'll look into it again! <cf>Can't give up on this one!
To be a hero, <cf>"Vortex Impact" is absolutely necessary!
What am I missing and how am I different from my heroes. ...... <cf>Once I figure that out, I feel like I can use it.
Thanks for hanging out with me! <cf>If you ever need anything else, I'm counting on you!
I definitely want to use "Vortex Impact"! <cf>I'm not giving up!
Anyway, practice! <cf>I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna be a hero!
It's not going so well. <cf>The Vortex Impact, ......
Hmmm, maybe you should go somewhere <cf>for a change.
Yo! <cf>Are you using "Vortex Impact"?
I still can't do it. <cf>I'm still missing something crucial.
So I got to thinking. <cf>I actually hadn't done that one yet!
[--] Pilgrimage to the Holy Land!
You know those Bapharia practices? <cf>You know, the ones where you travel and visit places associated with a god!
In my case, I should follow in the footsteps of Achim and other <cf>heroes!
That way, if you get close to the hero, you can use <cf>"Vortex Impact"!
...... Yeah, well. <cf>I guess it's just as well that I simply want to go there!
I'd really like to make a pilgrimage to the holy land of Achim the Hero, but <cf>I'm from the Principality of Bernhardt, so that's a bit of a stretch.
So let's follow the local heroes. <cf>Let's go to Minsterhorn first!
That's where the hero Lothar was born, <cf>who stepped on "Dragon Claw Valley".
Let's go to Minsterhorn!
It's where the hero Lothar was born. <cf>There may be a clue hidden there that will make you a hero!
I've been to Minsterhorn many times, <cf>but it feels special to think of it as a pilgrimage to a hero's sanctuary!
This is the birthplace of our hero Lothar.
Lothar was an adventurer who took on Dragon Claw Valley and formed a team called <cf>"Dragon Crow".
That team was the first to step on <cf>"Dragon Claw Valley"!
The trials that Lothar and his team overcame, <cf>there are still many adventurers out there challenging them.
The name of the book is "The Road to the Dragon"!　That's cool!
It's amazing, isn't it, heroes? <cf>Decades, even centuries later, they're still people's goals.
I want to leave a big footprint too, <cf>I want to be the kind of awesome guy who inspires the future!
Well, let's see. If you want to follow in Lothar's footsteps, <cf>you can't miss "Dragon Claw Valley" after all.
It's where Lothar was most active. <cf>You can't miss it!
Let's go to the front of "Dragon Claw Valley" next!
Let's go up to "Dragon Claw Valley."
Don't go inside yet, okay? <cf>I want to feel the breath of our hero Lothar from the outside first!
So this is the "Dragon Claw Valley"! <cf>Oh, something awesome to look at: ......
Once trod by heroes, and now future heroes will take up the challenge?
Damn, that's so cool! <cf>I'd love to step on it myself someday!
It's still hard for me to go deep with my ability. <cf>I still need "Vortex Impact".
Hero Lothar fought many monsters here.
The battle with goblins is famous, but <cf>there are many other stories left!
Among other things, the story of the Tyrant Boa's defeat has been told in the <cf>minstrels' songs.
I'm trying to recreate this legend!
Let's take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_03001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>"!
Let's get closer to being heroes. <cf>Let's take the first step as heroes!
When you're done, meet me at the entrance of "Dragon Claw Valley". <cf>Don't go home alone first, okay?
Let's use " <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>" to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_03001"/>!
Meet me at the entrance when you're done. <cf>Don't go home alone first, okay?
Ouch. ....... <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_03001"/>Accepted the attack of
Oh, you've finished taking them down too. <cf>You've been fighting well, as always.
I got hit and blown to pieces.
I was trying to do "Vortex Impact" and <cf>got stuck in the middle of a failed attempt.
Yeah. It didn't work this time either.
But I'm not giving up! <cf>It's my dream to be a hero!
Plus, I got to come to "Dragon Claw Valley" and fight, <cf>which gave me a little more confidence.
So I think I'm going to try that one next.
It's the legend of the hero Achim's <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>defeat!
I didn't think I could beat it, but <cf>maybe I can.
Me, I'll look for <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>! <cf>If we find it, let's go take it down together!
Go for it, hero! <cf>I had fun this time!　Thank you!
The Vortex Impact. ....... <cf>Why doesn't it work for me? ......!
But I'm not giving up! <cf>I'm going to be a hero!
Watch me, <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>! <cf>I'll take them down for sure!
I heard a <cf>story about seeing <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>in odd places.
Usually they are inside the ruins. <cf>Why are you wandering around outside ......?
Yo! <cf>Can I have your attention, please?
I told you I wanted to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>. <cf>Ahim the Hero had a legend like that.
So I found <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>!
But that <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>....... <cf>There's something wrong with it.
They are usually in the ruins of Bapharia. <cf>They're supposed to protect the ruins.
So there should be no hanging around out there.
And yet I found <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>hanging around <cf>Montegnor Valley.
And we're getting a little bit closer to Ritze!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>is a classic enemy in heroic tales. <cf>He is so strong that no ordinary warrior can stand against him.
In a pinch, <cf>the heroic Achim would sashay in and take him down.
That's how Achim saves people. <cf>It's really cool and I can't get enough of it.
But ...... I can't use "Vortex Impact" <cf>I'm still half a man.
...... Honestly, it's scary. <cf>I just want to run away.
But it doesn't work that way. <cf>Because Litze is my hometown ......!
Please, come with me to Litze! <cf>And <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>help us take them down!
I can't do it alone. <cf>I need you to protect Litze!
Come with me to Litze! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>We need your help to defeat them!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>Are you ready to take them down?
...... you're calm. <cf>I'm ...... getting a little shaky.
I always wanted to be a hero. <cf>I've been emulating them since I was a kid.
Now I have a chance to be like a hero right in front of me. <cf>And yet, I'm more scared than excited.
I think I know how my friend felt when he quit Twin Striker and went back to his <cf>village: ......
This is such a scary and painful experience: ......
What do you think? <cf>Do you really think I can be a hero?
...... No, I don't need an answer. <cf>I know.
You have to make your own decisions, right?
Every hero had his troubles. <cf>But in the end, he made up his own mind to fight!
So I'm ready to do it! <cf>...... I'm gonna do it!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>I will defeat the "Mere Old Man"! <cf>And protect the hometown I love!
Not to be a hero. <cf>I want to protect Litze more than anything else right now!
So I'm not going to run away. I'm going to fight.
He is at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>". <cf>It's only a matter of time before he comes to our village.
Come on, let's go! <cf>We're gonna take down <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>ourselves!
It's just up ahead, I hear a sound. <cf>...... <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>is there.
Yes, now that I'm here, I'm getting nervous. <cf>We're going to fight that guy now. ......
I'm still far from being a hero. <cf>I'm sure I'll never be able to defeat them in a cool way.
[--] But so what!
I'm here to be cool!　No, I'm not! <cf>I came here to protect Litze!
I will fight, even if it hurts, even if it's not cool, I will fight! <cf>I will never run away from it!
Come on, man. If I ever feel weak, <cf>you can kick me in the behind.
Come on, let's do it!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>Let's do it! <cf>We're your opponents!
<span size="Big">Yeeeeeesssss! &lt;/&gt;
I beat you!　You got him, didn't you?　 <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>We beat them!
It's not working anymore. ...... I did it. ...... seriously. ......
Haha look at ....... <cf>I'm still shaking my hand. ......
I won ......!　Just like Achim, <cf>I beat Quad Arm, ......!
Thank you!　You gave me the power! <cf>You gave me the power!
Now Ritze is relieved. <cf>Oh, I'm seriously relieved!
Oh, sorry. It's hard to relax when you're talking here <cf>forever, isn't it?
Let's go back to Litze. <cf>Hehe, it's like a hero's triumph!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>should not work anymore. <cf>That's a relief to Ritze, man.
Come on, let's get back to Litze! <cf>Triumphant return of a hero, is that too much to say?　Ha ha!
Good work! <cf>Well, that's an amazing accomplishment!
Hehe ....... I was just thinking about the fight. <cf>It made me laugh.
I was frantically swinging my axe anyway. <cf>I looked like I was going to cry.
There were a few times I really thought you were going to <cf>kick my ass!
Even at ....... <cf>That's how I would have fought, and I could have done it!
The Vortex Impact. ......! <cf>Isn't that awesome?　It just came up by accident!
This means we're a little closer to being heroes! <cf>We're getting closer to heroes, aren't we?
Ha ha ha ......!　I did it!!! <cf>I took down that <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>!
This is the first step for our hero Manuel!
I'm going to train again! <cf>To make that technique my own!
I'm sure you'll be able to use "Vortex Impact" and <cf>defend yourself properly. ......
I'm going to be a great Twin Striker <cf>as good as you are!
Thank you! <cf>Thanks to you, I was able to protect Litze!
Thanks so much for saving my village and <cf>being my new target!
Yo, it's you! <cf>You're having a hell of an adventure today, aren't you?
I'm back in training! <cf>Because the road to becoming a hero has just begun!
Are you interested in Blast Archer!
I'm leaning back too much! <cf>I'm going down, I'm going down!
[--]You came! <cf>I knew you would come to me!
Why do you think that, sir? <cf>If I had to say, I'd say ...... smell, I guess.
My sense of smell as a Blast Archer <cf>sniffed out your brilliant talent!
...... Oh, what?　Not uke?
'Making friends is all about complimenting first impressions!' I heard <cf>that. ......
Oh, don't go home dumbfounded!　No, it's not! <cf>I really wanted Blast Archer's company!
I am still in training. <cf>Accepting requests to defeat monsters and so on, I'm trying to hone my skills.
But I felt lonely and uninspired when I was alone. <cf>I thought it would be nice if I could practice with someone.
I've been waiting for someone to be interested in Blast Archer for a long time <cf>and I'm so happy and excited!
So, you know?　We can teach each other what we know, <cf>work together to accomplish the same request, and so on.
Let's help each other like that! <cf>It will be fun and you will improve!　See?
Let's go to <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>to take them down for starters. <cf>I just now Accepted the request at the Pioneer Bureau.
Of course, we will pay you for your services. <cf>We are not asking you to help us for free.
You get paid and get to practice your bow, killing two birds with one stone! <cf>So, let's get out of town!
I get angry if I wave my bow around in the presence of people. <cf>I've had enough of that!
We'll start by taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>!
We'll meet outside the gates of Asterleeds. <cf>Don't start alone, okay?
Well, well, well. We are now in the wide, wide Asteria Plain. <cf>I can shoot my bow as much as I want here!
Blast Archers are a class that excels at long-range attacks. <cf>But that's not all!
It can also obstruct enemy movement or cover an ally. <cf>The most important feature is the breadth of the system!
There is so much you can do, <cf>you have to look around that much more closely too!
But if you can master the Blast Archer technique, <cf>you can even take control of the battle!
The basic rule is still to keep a good distance from the enemy. <cf>It's better to attack from a distance.
Well, let's put aside the details <cf>anyway <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>and the real battle!
It's okay. <cf>It's faster to try these things!
Then, let's split up and set out to defeat them!
Oh, and please give me a shout again when you're done.
Since we came all the way here together, <cf>you can't just leave on your own!
Let's <cf>take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>with " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>"!
Well, this is a piece of cake! <cf>Come on, let's get this over with!
Hmmm... <cf>What shall we have for dinner today?
...... is that thing! <cf>You've already finished defeating them!
Wow, wow! <cf>I'm surprised you got it done so quickly!
Maybe you are <cf>more of a gem than I thought!
And how lucky I am to meet someone like that <cf>!
...... What?　Is that me? <cf>I'm not slacking off. I was just taking a break.
You can't leave until ...... I'm done and the reward is ......?
So, so, so <span size="Big">I did! &lt;/&gt;
Because I'm always Accepting requests alone <cf>I overlooked such a blissful oversight!
Eh, oh, wait!　Wait a minute! <cf>I'll go finish it right away!
Oh, oh, oh, but..! <cf>Is it okay if I tell you now about my next request or something!
I, for one, want to try a more difficult request next time! <cf>I wanted to ask you to come with me then as well!
Oh, I don't mean right now. <cf>If I don't get stronger, I'll die. Ha-ha-ha.
I'm not trying to say you are weak! <cf>I'm sorry. ！！！！
And anyway!　I'm talking about growing up properly and then trying <cf>the next request, that's what I'm talking about!
I'm always usually where we meet! <cf>Please call on me again when you get stronger!
No, I still think I'm strong enough, though! <cf>Let's get stronger as Blast Archers together!
It's a promise!　Absolutely! <cf>Well, then, um, I'm off!
It's fun to Accept a request with someone!
I've been a Blast Archer for a long time, but <cf>this was my first time!
Oh ...... I wonder if there will be a second time ......
How is your Blast Archer practice going?
If you want, we can practice together again. <cf>Just a little!　Just a little bit!
So you can go out with us? <cf>Yay!　You are a good person after all!
I'm a fast learner of the bow and have a good streak. <cf>You will definitely be an awesome Blast Archer!
When you do, please refer me as your best friend at <cf>!　What?　No?
Well, well, well, whatever. <cf>Now that we're getting to know each other, let's work together.
So, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I have a request to take down. <cf>I have a few things I'd like to try!
Do you know the story about the nuts called "yamibami nuts" attracting <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>?
I heard that everything has a unique scent and <cf>used to use <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>as a tool to trap people!
See, Blast Archers are <cf>primarily long-range attackers.
I thought it would be a good idea to lure <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>with "Yami Bami no Nuts" and aim at <cf>from a distance!
What a nice idea! <cf>This will make it so much easier to defeat them!
First, let's go to Minsterhorn and get ready. <cf>You can pick "Yamibami nuts" over there.
And <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>also goes out to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>. <cf>It's all in the neighborhood. Lucky me!
I'll meet you at Minsterhorn then. <cf>I'll go ahead of you!
Oh my god, the way you just said that, <span size="Big">sounds like a friend! &lt;/&gt;
I've never met up with someone before!　I'm so happy!
Let's meet at Minsterhorn.
Oh, he said he's meeting up with someone! <cf>Sounds like a friend!　I wanted to say that once!
I wonder if it's ready yet...........................fidgety ....... <cf>I'm so excited to meet up with my friends!
Oh, but I can't believe I've been waiting outside all this time <cf>getting pulled ......?　I'll have to fake it well!
...... is, wow! <cf>You, what, when did you get there!
Um!　I just got here too!
…………………………………………
<span size="Big">......&lt;/&gt; <value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/><span size="Big">Taking down! &lt;/&gt;
Yes, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>we're talking about taking down the guy!
That's why we collect 'yamibami nuts'. <cf>That's right. That was our plan all along.
Let's split up and look for them. <cf>I'm pretty sure it can be picked around here.
When you're done collecting, come back here.
I'll do my best to do it right. <cf>Well then, I look forward to working with you!
There should be <cf>"Yami Bami nuts" down near Minsterhorn!
Let's split up and go collect them. <cf>I'll do my part!
Thank you for your hard work! <cf>Have you collected the "Yami Bami no Nuts"?
Oh, that's great. <cf>I've been collecting mine properly too.
Well then, let's grind this up: ......
...... is <span size="Big">crummy!　What is this? &lt;/&gt;
It smells like leftover meat! <cf>Oh no!　It reminds me of something strange!
Ugh ...... so I wonder if <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>will come close to it. <cf>I hear monsters are sensitive to smells though.
In the old days, hunters and others used various scents to <cf>deceive or trap their prey.
...... Um, please don't casually turn your nose away. <cf>It's hurtful, okay?
Hmmm, but is it effective? <cf>It's hard to tell right away.
Anyway, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>needs to be taken down and we need to take them down. <cf>If we get a lot of them, we'll have to deal with them.
Blast Archers keep their distance. <cf>Nevertheless, they can still be surrounded by enemies!
In such a case, do not panic, but aim and attack. <cf>You can't get out of a situation by shooting blindly.
Check the battle situation properly while continuously attacking. <cf>Choose the best way to attack at that moment!
Phew... ....... <cf>Are you surprised that I suddenly sounded sane?
I was not practicing alone! <cf>How many times have I read the manuals?
No, because I didn't have anyone to talk to. ...... <cf>Thanks to you, I know the manual by heart, word for word.
So, whether I can actually do it or not, <cf>I'm good at putting theories together anyway!
...... What's with the pity in your eyes? <cf>You'll get hurt again, won't you?
Well, whatever it is, it is practice! <cf>Because logic won't defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
I'll meet you here when I'm done! <cf>Wow, I sounded like a friend again!
Now, it's time to get down to business! <cf>It's time to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
Just follow the manual you memorized and you'll be fine! <cf>Read it just one more time before you go to ....... Let's see... ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Thank you very much for your hard work in defeating the problem!
Hmmm ....... The "Yami Bami no Nuts" was not so good. <cf>Especially since <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>doesn't seem to be gathering.
Be that as it may. <cf>I knew your skills were first class!
I would very much like to ask you for a favor! <cf>Can you please listen to me?
In fact, I have a prey I really want to hunt.
But I couldn't hunt that guy by myself, so I went to ....... <cf>I was looking for a trustworthy and skilled companion.
Please keep this between us at ....... <cf>My brother got beat up by that guy ......
So I definitely want to hunt them down with my own hands!
If we work together with you, <cf>I'm sure we can hunt that guy down someday!
Not necessarily right now. <cf>Especially since I'm probably still out of practice.
But when the time comes, please. <cf>Please pick up your bow with me.
I know it's a selfish promise, but ...... I believe in you <cf>because, because ...... we're friends, right?
Awww... ......!　 <span size="Big">Yes, I said it. ...... &lt;/&gt;
Um, um, I!　I'm going back to Asterleeds! <cf>I'm usually at my usual place!
So ...... that ....... <cf>...... please give me a shout again, okay?
Well, well, well!　Excuse me!
Well, thank you for your hard work! <cf>This is the end of the story of your friendship with me!
But that doesn't mean it's over! <cf>Our battle is just beginning!
One day our story will continue again. <cf>Somehow, I have a hunch that we will.
I'll wait a little bit until that time comes. <cf>The day I can fight with you. I, I'm looking forward to it. ♪
Picked up "yamibami nuts."
When you grow up as a Blast Archer, <cf>you'll want a new weapon!
So, if you can, me and, you know! <cf>Weapons to ...... matching ......!
I'm still not ready for the matching! <cf>We're not ready for matching yet!
How are you doing? <cf>How is your Blast Archer practice going?
I've been working a little harder too! <cf>I need to brush up on my skills to make up for my brother.
So, I have a challenge for you today.
I have just Accepted a good request. <cf>It's to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
Minsterhorn's asked for a large outbreak of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>that is destroying their fields.
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>and fly in the sky, right?
So it was a bit of a hassle to take them down. <cf>That's where we, Blast Archers, come in!
Blast Archer features, of course, <cf>the ability to strike at a distance!
A flying monster is just that!
So I would like to practice with you. <cf>So [--] anti-aircraft combat!
Oh no!　 <span size="Big">Cool! &lt;/&gt;
'Friendship power to air combat!' What a <cf>word I would like to say at least once in my life!
...... Huh?　Not really?
Anyway, let's go to <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>to take them down. <cf>First, go to Minsterhorn!
Now, with your hot and burning friendship with me, <cf>we will conquer that great sky!
Oh, God!　Too nice! <cf>I wanted to say this at least once in my life too!
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>Let's go to <cf>to Minsterhorn to take down the
<span size="Big">Anti-air combat with friendship power! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, God!　No matter how many times I say it, it feels so good!
Hello!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>I'm here to take down <cf>Blast Archer!
<span size="Big">Two of us! &lt;/&gt; We both came together!
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I can count on you both to come.
What are we going to do? <cf>We're so dependable!
I guess the people who understand us understand us! <cf>Our overflowing power of friendship!
Actually, besides <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>I saw a flying monster!
It's a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>He's a ferocious guy, unlike <cf>I was worried about him alone.
What ......?　 <cf>Big ...... Kagachiyamma ......!
I see. <cf>But the kagachiyamma didn't do any damage.
I just saw it in the distance. <cf>Still, it was big enough to be recognizable, though.
Well, you can keep your hands off that one.
It's more <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>There are more of them, and they're fluttering away. ......
...... hmm?　What's the matter, sweetie? <cf>You look kind of difficult.
You don't think he's ......? <cf>...... Oh, no!　It's nothing!
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>We can take down the "Mere Old Man", right? <cf>I'll take care of it!
Please. <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>looks like it comes from <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"
Let's go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" then. <cf>It seems to appear in a wide area, so let's split up.
When you're done taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>, we'll meet up again here <cf>
Let's take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
The big Kagachiyanma is ...... <cf>Never mind for now!
Thanks for your hard work! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>Defeat, it looks like you're done.
Well, that was a big help. <cf>As expected of an adventurer, you're pretty handy.
Even flying monsters are <cf>easy to take down.
Yes, I am. That is the essence of Blast Archer!
If we keep the numbers this low, <cf>I don't think they'll be able to raid the fields!
Yes, I'm good to go. <cf>Thanks a lot. I guess that completes the request.
I'm done with that ...... request. <cf>Can you hang out with me a little longer?
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>I was in the middle of defeating <cf>and found something I was interested in ......
I also have something to tell you. <cf>I'll be waiting for you at the "outskirts of the village."
Please come to the edge of the village.
I have something I need to tell you. <cf>Go ahead, I'll wait for you.
Sorry for making you stop by. <cf>I was really curious about something: ......
During the course of the strike, we examined the carcass at <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>
I did, and there were marks where something big had <cf>eaten away at it!
Perhaps it's the work of a large Kagachiyanma, as witnessed by my client <cf>
No, exactly. ...... <cf>"Sky Serpent"
Do you remember my brother's story about the monster that got him at <cf>?
It was my brother who taught me to bow.
He wasn't very good, and he wasn't very strong. <cf>He was my first teacher.
My brother said ["]hunting flying monsters is an important part of <cf>Blast Archer's job["].
You may think what an obvious thing to say, but <cf>this is very important!
Be the first to shoot someone who is out of reach of your friends. <cf>That's how you can help your friends.
But then my brother was beaten. <cf>In "The Sky Serpent," ......
He survived, but his wounds were so deep <cf>that my brother retired from Blast Archer.
I want to defeat the <cf>"Sky Serpent" to avenge my brother's death!
I've been following "Sky Serpent" on <cf>for a long time and finally found a clue!
I will find "Sky Serpent". <cf>Will you fight with me then?
I'm still a work in progress, so I've been working on ....... <cf>I need your help!
Sorry for the long story. <cf>Please, please remember me. Please!
The Sky Serpent. ...... <cf>Revenge for hurting my brother. ......
We will find them! <cf>And when we do, I hope you will fight with us!
<span size="Big">Avenge my brother! &lt;/&gt;
...... is not about you! <cf>It's about "Sky Serpent"!
It's very, very hard!　It's very hard!
I found it! <cf>I finally found it!
What? That guy!　It's my brother's avenger! <cf>The Sky Serpent!
An adventurer from Litze says he <cf>saw him clearly!
Just the other day, he said it looked like they were using that area as a feeding ground to hunt <cf>prey.
I can't stay like this! <cf>We have to get to Montegnor Valley right away!
The Sky Serpent" is a mysterious creature. <cf>It may disappear again.
We will catch up with them at all costs before we lose them!
Let's gather information in Litze first! <cf>I'll go ahead and follow you!
Your friendship with me will not let you escape! <cf>Wait and see, "Sky Serpent"!
The "Sky Serpent" seems to be using Montegnor Valley as a <cf>feeding ground!
Let's go to Litze! <cf>To show you the power of our friendship!
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Are you by any chance an acquaintance of Lily's?
You see, that energetic. <cf>She's that Blast Archer girl with the funny sense of distance.
He was running into the mountains at a high rate of speed. <cf>He asked me to give you a message.
I found ["]The Sky Serpent! <cf>I'm going after it, so please go after it! ["]"]
[You'll come, won't you?　Absolutely! <cf>You'll definitely come after me, won't you! ["]]
["]No, I mean! <cf>Well, I'd love it if you did. ......["]"]
Hmm?　Where did they go?
That's why ....... <cf>She ran away from me at once.
They didn't say where they were going.
Ah, but you know what? <cf>I heard a sound coming from the mountains just now.
Hugh!　That's the sound of ....... <cf>It's a sound like a hunter's arrow on the back of a horse.
I think it's somewhere not that far from the village. <cf>I think it's on the top of the cliff to the east.
It should be somewhere on ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>'. <cf>Go look for him.
I heard the sound of <cf>[Kaburaya] from the cliff top, east of the village!
I think it has something to do with this girl Lily. <cf>It's kind of dangerous, and you should go look for her.
Wow!　You came! <cf>Thank goodness!
You heard the sound of [KABURAYA], didn't you? <cf>I knew you would get the message!
With the sound of a single arrow, he realizes my danger and <cf>even guesses my whereabouts without words. ......
This is the sign of a true friend who can communicate with each other! <cf>I am so impressed by your friendship!
...... what?　Usually the villagers tell me about it and ......
Oh, I didn't know that. ...... Hi
Haha ....... But I've made a doozy.
I saw the shadows in The Sky Serpent, <cf>because all I could see was the sky.
I didn't realize when <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>was surrounded by <cf>!
Blast Archers are <cf>in pain if they get caught in time, even though they have to be careful ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>I also lost <cf>"Sky Serpent" while running from
I'm so tired, I can't move anymore. ......
Um, sorry for the inconvenience. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>I was wondering if you could take down the
I will manage to get back to Litze in the meantime.
Sorry. <cf>I keep dragging my feet, but please.
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>and then return to <cf>Litze
I'll be back as soon as I have a chance. <cf>Sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks for getting us back safe and sound.
I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't come to <cf>......
But I saw it with my own eyes! <cf>I saw the Sky Serpent with my own eyes!
I still want to beat him. <cf>I want to avenge my brother!
Practice your bow, look around a lot, <cf>I still have a lot to work out, but
We will never just give up!
This time I will be fully prepared and <cf>look for the "Sky Serpent" once again!
Thank you for this time! <cf>I'll show you my good side next time, too!
The Sky Serpent, ....... <cf>Where in the world did they disappear to?
This time, we won't let you get away with it. ......
I've seen "The Sky Serpent" at <cf>none of them are far away!
I wish there was a way to make sure I could get close to it. ......
My brother's avenger, "Sky Serpent"! <cf>I found his 'nest'!
So far I've only seen them from afar, but with <cf>nests, I can always get closer!
However, they are not stupid. <cf>If they know they are being targeted, they will move their nests.
If they get away from Montegnor Valley, <cf>we'll have to start looking again from scratch!
At all costs, we have to take this opportunity to finish it!
[--] because I always fail when I'm in a hurry!
Let's get our preparations right first and get ready to get poised at <cf>Litze!
I'll see you later! <cf>I'll be in Litze, so please give me a shout.
The "Sky Serpent" nest is located at <cf>in Montegnor Valley
First, let's get ready in Litze. <cf>We'll talk in detail there. I'll go ahead!
We've been waiting for you! <cf>Now, it's time to defeat the "Sky Serpent"!
I've heard <cf>that his nest is at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>'
I have actually seen the marks where it has eaten away at them. <cf>The Sky Serpent is definitely out there.
But the trouble is, it seems there are some cronies.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>are swarming and <cf>seem to be territorial near their nests!
To defeat the "Sky Serpent," <cf>we need to eliminate the cronies first.
So let's take it one move at a time and move forward steadily.
The first step is to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Don't worry. If we split up, it won't be a problem.
The Sky Serpent" is after that. <cf>We've come this far, and now we're one step closer!
Let's do our best! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>to defeat the "Mere Old Man" and meet up here!
Let's take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>"!
When you are done, let's meet up here. <cf>After that, it's time for the decisive battle!
My brother's revenge: ......! <cf>The defeat of the "Sky Serpent"!
Ah, welcome back. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>I see that you were able to defeat the
Sorry. <cf>I've been having some trouble on my end.
Actually, <cf>"Sky Serpent" showed up while we were taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>
It seems they were after this little girl who had wandered into the mountains. <cf>I was in a hurry to protect her.
I'm sorry, sister! <cf>Are you hurt? Does it hurt?
Don't go into the mountains alone. <cf>It's dangerous.
I'm fine!　I just twisted my leg a bit and <cf>Blast Archer is strong!
Now, let's go home to your mother. <cf>You must be sorry, okay?
Yup! <cf>Thanks, Blast Archer's sister!
Well, I was surprised. <cf>But I'm glad the girl is safe.
Besides, listen to me! <cf>It was only one shot, but I hit the target!
At the head of "Sky Serpent!
That guy stumbled a bit! <cf>That's when he ran away with the girl.
It's a good job for me, don't you think? <cf>Don't you think so?　I think so!
Well, the "Sky Serpent" got away with <cf>just like that. Hahahaha!
haha ...... ha............
..................gsss ......... .........
I ...... me ......! <cf>I'm so disappointed ............!
He was right there ...... in front of me! <cf>That guy, "Sky Serpent"!
And yet, it didn't work. ...... <cf>I can't believe I came all this way and got injured like this......!
I'm so close to avenging my brother's ......! <cf>I ...... feel sorry for myself. ......
What, ......?　I'm not done with ......
If you go after them now, you can defeat them ....... <cf>But with my injured leg, I'll be able to run away again and ......
...... together, will you come?
Thank you ......! <cf>Thank you ......!
That's right! <cf>This is no time to be down!
Let's go after the "Sky Serpent! <cf>We were originally aiming to defeat him!
He ran away toward " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>". <cf>I think he must have gone back to his nest.
I've reduced the number of cronies <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>and <cf>must be frustrated that they missed the bait!
Now is your chance. Let's go! <cf>This time, I'm going to lead him away!
Let's follow "Sky Serpent!
He has a nest at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>". <cf>He must be soaring there.
This time I will avenge my brother! <cf>Please lend me your strength!
There it is: ......!　This is "Sky Serpent"!
Brother ...... I'm finally here. <cf>Keep watching.
I will do it. <cf>With this bow that my brother taught me!
I will definitely avenge my brother's death!
Let's go! <cf>With you and me together, we are not afraid of any enemy!
The Sky Serpent!　[--]Prepare yourself!
............ did you ............?
Eh, ...... that?　Well, we ....... <cf>The Sky Serpent. ......
Did you defeat ......?　Are you sure ......?
Ya ...... yay!!! ！！！！
Wow!!! <cf>Thank you!　Thank you so much!
<span size="Big">I'm glad ......! &lt;/&gt;
Gusun ...... glad you're here ......
Finally, finally ......! <cf>I finally avenged my brother!
Have I become a little stronger? <cf>I've become strong enough to say I'm a full-fledged Blast Archer.
Ehehe, thank you very much. <cf>I'm kind of embarrassed to say it myself.
Come on, let's go back to Litze. <cf>I, I feel like I can walk with my chest out now!
We were able to defeat the "Sky Serpent". <cf>Thanks to you. Thank you very much!
Come on, let's go back to Litze!
Sigh - you're back!
We really did defeat them, didn't we? ...... <cf>I still feel a little like I'm in a dream!
Ah!　Blast Archer's sister!
Hey, hey, sisters. <cf>You killed a great monster, didn't you?
The hunter's uncle told me. <cf>He said there were no more monsters to ravage the mountains.
I knew Blast Archer was strong!
Haha, that's right. <cf>We killed the scary monsters.
A very strong Blast Archer here <cf>has been helping me!
Wow, cool!
Wow, wow, wow! <cf>I want to be a Blast Archer too!
I'm glad to hear that! <cf>Let's have adventures together when you grow up!
Yay!　I promise. <cf>I'll do my best in both my studies and bow practice.
Come back and visit us in Litze. <cf>Bye bye, Mr. Blast Archer!
Hmmm, that reminds me a bit. <cf>I said something similar to my brother...
You're a lovely <cf>Blast Archer in that boy's eyes, too.
It's that ....... <cf>I just want to say again, ......
I was soon full of ....... <cf>But you fought with me all the way and ......
I, I ......!
<span size="Big">I love you! &lt;/&gt;
Wow!　I said it!
But, but, but, it's true! <cf>I'm really happy!
Thank you very, very much! <cf>I am very happy to have met you!
Please accept this. <cf>As a reward for your commission [--] and as a memorial to us.
Dear my proud friend! <cf>Mr. Best Blast Archer!
Hi there! <cf>Um, ...... my friend!
And what is Mr. Friend! <cf>What am I talking about!
Um! <cf>Can you accept the request, again, with ......?
Ehehehe ...... promise, right?
Interested in Spell Caster?
I am in need of Spell Caster's assistance. <cf>I could use your help. ......
I'm, um, ...... Seilah. Seilah. <cf>Sorry. I just can't seem to get the name out of my head right away.
I really needed Spell Caster's help. <cf>I'm glad you Accepted my request.
I'd like to ask you for a quick favor, if that's okay.
I need you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Do you know it? <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>
It's a monster that lives in Asteria Plain. <cf>...... You don't think they're extinct already, do you?
Are you still at ......?　That's good to know. <cf>No, I'm talking about here. Never mind.
Well, let's get on our way. <cf>I will accompany you. Let's get out of town first.
I would also like to see what is going on in Asteria Plain. <cf>Let me talk to you again when we get out of town.
I need you to go out to Asteria Plain and take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>
We'll talk about the details when we leave Asterleeds. <cf>Let's get there first, shall we?
Oh ......!　Nice view. <cf>Impressive to be standing on Asteria Plain like this again.
Oh, no. Not so ....... <cf>It's been a while since I've been to ......!　Yes, it's been a while. So I'm impressed.
It's more about taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>I'm sure you're a Spell Caster yourself know this.
The key to the Spell Caster's battle is the circulation of engrams. <cf>Unleash your skills and you will lose your biological engram.
If the engrams run out, they will not be able to fight satisfactorily. <cf>Therefore, it is necessary to restore it from time to time.
Skill is released. Engrams decrease. <cf>Recover and release the skill again, and so on.
This circle is the foundation and essence of Spell Caster. <cf>Don't ever forget it!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>to defeat the Engram, you will get the Engram. <cf>I want you to share some of that with me.
I'll take care of the preparations on my end, <cf>you can take them down and come back as usual.
I am collecting the materials needed in that area. <cf>I'll let you know when I'm done defeating them and if you'll give me a shout back.
I'm sorry to ask you to go through all this trouble. <cf>Please, I'm looking forward to working with you.
Can you take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>"?
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>The engrams of <cf>remain faintly in your body. I want you to share it with me.
Hey, welcome back. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>I'm glad you've been able to take down the
Okay, just as I thought. You have <cf>biological engrams clinging around you.
Okay, I'll take some of this: ......
...... This is good to go. Thanks. <cf>But that was a lot quicker than I thought it would be.
It takes a certain amount of time to master the skills of a Spell Caster <cf>
You seem to have the gift of Spell Caster. <cf>Perhaps you could solve my problem.
Actually, I'm in a bit of a bind. <cf>I have very little use for my skills right now.
Sorry for the ...... cause. I am not at liberty to disclose it publicly. <cf>It's not something I'm guilty of. That's for sure.
I need the help of someone I can rely on to help me get out of this situation. <cf>I need you to gather various engrams with me.
What I'm trying to do is somewhat specific. <cf>I still need a few more types of engrams.
Spell Caster is a class with particularly strong <cf>ties to natural engrams.
By defeating the monster with its power, <cf>only then will I get the engram I seek!
That's why I wanted Spell Caster to help me. <cf>It's an undeserved stroke of luck to have found you.
Nevertheless, obtaining engrams involves risk. <cf>You can't ask for it unless you are reasonably good at it.
I'd be happy for you to visit me again <cf>after you've gained some discipline and increased your strength.
I will wait forever for you to come to me. <cf>It is the least I, as Seilah, can do.
I am in Asterleeds, always in the same place. <cf>Call on me again when the time comes. Bye.
It's frustrating not being able to use your skills. <cf>I envy you fighting out there.
However, there are things you can learn <cf>just by looking at people on the street!
There's been a flurry of adventurers around these days. <cf>It seems like there are more monsters too.
Might be a good time to get some experience as a Spell Caster <cf>
How about training as a Spell Caster?
If you're available, <cf>I'd be happy to talk to you again.
You are indeed a kind man. <cf>I can't thank you enough for helping me out again.
If I could use my skills myself <cf>I wouldn't have to bother you ......
No, there's no point in speaking out of turn. <cf>What I have to say now is my acknowledgment to you. Thank you.
To get myself back to normal as a Seilah, <cf>I will still need various engrams.
This time I need <cf>"Nimrite Ore" from Asteria Plain.
It is a very fragile stone, easily broken, and of limited use. <cf>It was hard to find in this city.
Then we also need engrams from <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>I'll need you to take this one down later.
Same as before <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Let me collect the engrams that remain on your body after the defeat.
These two things will help me, the Seilah, this time.
The key to getting out of a situation where you can't use your skills and can't get out of town to collect <cf>
Of course, it's just part of a massively needed key <cf>that won't solve all of our problems right away.
I've heard that <cf>"Nimrite ore" can be found around Minsterhorn.
I'm going to check the soil there. <cf>I wonder if you could escort me there.
Please take me, Seilah, to Minsterhorn <cf>. Best regards.
Can you escort me to Minsterhorn?
The soil found in that vicinity contains the engrams that I, <cf>Seilah, need.
Here we are. Thanks a lot. <cf>I'll see if I can check the soil around here without being seen.
I don't want to be too conspicuous. <cf>Let's see. ......
Mm ....... It certainly contains 'nimrite ore'. <cf>I'm pretty sure it's produced near here.
How do I know?
You see the engrams, not the soil itself. <cf>You might describe it as feeling it.
Just like living organisms, ores and other inorganic materials contain <cf>engrams.
I found myself recovering my biological engrams, <cf>I wonder if that's possible?
Even if nothing else is done, the <cf>engrams in the natural environment slowly permeate the body!
I apply this to identify them from the engrams. <cf>Especially me, being a Seilah, I am very sensitive.
Oops, sorry. That was just a trivia question. <cf>It's a bad habit of mine to talk too long.
Let's get back to the main topic. Unfortunately, the <cf>engrams in the soil are still not enough.
I need the 'nimrite ore' itself. <cf>Can you go and collect it for me?
I will set up the engram extraction procedure. <cf>When you have the numbers, come back here.
Can you collect "Nimrite ore" for me?
You'll find them in the "Minster Hills." <cf>Just look near the village and you'll be fine.
Welcome back. <cf>You collected the "Nimrite Ore" for us, didn't you?
It helps. It was not working for other lands. <cf>I had to make some really subtle engram adjustments.
We still need more materials, and we have a long way to go. <cf>Will the day ever come when everything is in place?
We can't spend too much time on this. <cf>If we don't do this, she will ......
...... No, we can't afford to be wishy-washy. <cf>We'll just have to move forward, step by step.
There is one more thing I would like to ask. <cf>That's right. <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>It's the engram of
As I mentioned as a request at the beginning, I need you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and collect the engrams.
Those men are cunning and brutal. <cf>But if you know how to fight them, they are not as bad as you fear them.
Don't just attack blindly. <cf>Change your aim depending on the situation.
Remain calm in the midst of continuous attacks. <cf>Be aware of the use of engrams.
Oh, I shouldn't. Another long story. <cf>Being a Seilah, I'll get to this in a minute.
It's okay. I believe in your power. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I believe in your power, and I hope you will come back and defeat the
I need you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>that appears on " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>".
Come back when you're done. <cf>I need to use the engrams that cling to you.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>It looks like the defeat went without a hitch. <cf>Thank you. And I'm glad you're safe.
Now, let me extract the biological engrams that cling to you <cf>
...... I've been asked to stay with you up to this point. <cf>Let's talk more about my 'troubled state'.
Actually, I am not Seilah herself. <cf>I am the Imagine she invoked.
Somehow, I got <cf>attached to her body and I can't get away from her!
Plus, my consciousness is winning and <cf>Seilah can't even speak.
I didn't do it on purpose. <cf>I want to give my body back to Seilah.
For this purpose, they perform special rituals. <cf>And you collect the necessary engrams.
It's not a story I can reveal to anyone, so I can't <cf>[indiscreetly] ask people to do it.
Your cooperation is deeply appreciated by Seilah. <cf>Because with me, she can talk too.
Seilah wanted me to reveal the truth to you, too. <cf> She said, "["]Because I can trust you ["]," she said.
Seilah is also an excellent Spell Caster. <cf>I wonder if there is something about you that draws me to you somewhere.
Anyway, that's the situation. <cf>Both me and Seilah have engram disruption and can't use our skills.
So I think I will be under your care for the rest of my life. <cf>Please, I beg of you.
I am back in Asterleeds again. <cf>If you see me, I'd be glad to hear from you.
To save not me, Seilah, but Seilah herself. <cf>I need your help.
Your generosity is sincerely appreciated. <cf>As Seilah, this is all I can ask of you at this time.
When you move the destiny of Seilah and me being Seilah, <cf>I'm afraid I'll be a little ahead of you.
Until then, let's wait <cf>quietly for the right time while synthesizing engrams!
I'm not bored. This city looks a lot different than it did when I, Seilah, was <cf>alive.
It's amazing how much progress has been made in the use of heritage and technology. <cf>I'm amazed that water and sewage systems are in place.
I was so surprised that I jabbed at it and <cf>Seilah got mad at me!
Picked up "Nimrite Ore".
As a Spell Caster, <cf>you seem to be steadily growing!
You should also pay attention to your weapons. <cf>You should use something appropriate to your abilities.
Hey, it's you. <cf>Thanks for taking care of me. Thank you.
In order to return this body to Seilah, <cf>I have to go looking for engrams again this time!
We need engrams that can be <cf>extracted from a plant called "Yogenka.
However, "[Yogenka]" is extremely rare. <cf>You can't even get it in Asterleeds.
I was having a hard time ...... <cf>I just remembered I have one thing in mind.
This was when I, Seilah, was still alive.
I offered <cf>"[Yogenka]" on the grave marker of a great man.
I jarred the dried flowers so <cf>there should still be some left if you're lucky.
The amount of engrams needed is very small. <cf>If we can find even a tiny piece, that's all we need.
But the destination is Bahamar Highland.
As a Seilah with unsatisfactory skills, I can't go to <cf>alone very well.
Besides, we need the engrams from <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>I still have to ask for your help.
Let's go to Larpal first. On the way, I want you to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>".
We're in Larpal, so <cf>let me know when you're done taking down the Horngoat.
Have you finished taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>"?
When you're done, come on down to Larpal. <cf>We'll go ahead, please.
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>I see you were able to get the "Mere Old Man" to take them down.
Thank you. <cf>Now, I'll take what engrams you have left on your body.
Well. We're headed to <cf>, the place associated with Spell Caster's founder, Emmaline.
She was born in a small village in Bernhardt territory.
When that village was attacked by the dragon tribe, <cf>they fought them off with fire and blizzard!
Emmeline's manipulation of engrams was extremely [elaborate], and <cf>various natural phenomena were desired and caused.
[--]Yes. <cf>That's the prototype of the Spell Caster's skill set.
Emmeline is the "First Spell Caster". <cf>But he's also a legend and a paper-thin figure.
After all, he lived in an ancient time. <cf>The details of his personality and accomplishments are not clear.
But it's true that she explored things throughout her life and traveled all over the <cf>world.
With all due respect to that attitude, <cf>Spell Caster values inquisitiveness!
......... and I'm getting off topic!
I, as Seilah, visited it when I was alive. <cf>What a great place to visit is Emmeline's Tombstone!
She is sleeping in the "Soundless Foothills". <cf>Take me, the Seilah, there.
Emmeline's tombstone is in "Soundless Foothills". <cf>Take me, Seilah, with you.
Oh, how I've missed ....... <cf>Here's the tombstone for Emmaline.
Huh, you look like you're just a rock.
That's right. This is just a rock. <cf>There's nothing to say about it. It's not a special place.
That's why it makes sense. ...... and it shouldn't. <cf>Let's just serve our purpose first.
......Oh, thank goodness. <cf>I'm Seilah, and I still have the jar of my offering.
The "Yogenka" also remains. <cf>Now we have the engrams needed for the ritual again.
Thank you. You did it again.
But instead, I've taken away one of your pleasures, <cf>
The search for Emmeline's tombstone is one of <cf>Spell Caster's quest assignments.
Emmeline made this mere rock her own tombstone.
They didn't dare leave a marker, <cf>they just wanted the backward Spell Caster to find it.
Collecting clues left in books, remains, and anecdotes, <cf>can help you find this place.
I'm sure there are some modern day Spell Caster's out there <cf>looking for the Emmaline tombstone.
So, can we keep this to ourselves, please?
No worries. I'm sure you have other, <cf>larger themes to 'explore'!
Yes [--] timelessly 'questing'.
Now, being Seilah, I think I'll go home. <cf>I have to go on with the ritual preparations.
Engram needs a little more. <cf>Thanks again. See you soon.
Me being Seilah and Seilah, <cf>we talk about a lot of things in our minds!
History, and old friends. ....... <cf>I wonder if your story comes up a lot these days.
Spell Caster is dedicated to the spirit of "Inquiry" in pursuit of truth and facts and <cf>unraveling mysteries.
Have you found the theme of your "quest"? <cf>There is sure to be a big mystery waiting for you!
Hi. It's me, <cf>Imagine, obsessed with Seilah the Spell Caster.
Oh dear. <cf>It's getting more and more complicated to name names.
If I don't return this to Seilah as soon as possible, <cf>I'm going to bite my tongue!
To protect my tongue, which is Seilah's, <cf>let's find the engrams needed for the ritual!
This time, I'm Seilah and I'd like to collect my <cf>bio-engrams.
I found two tools that he used before he died.
However, they are both monster dens. <cf>We need your help.
One is the tent pillar at <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>on ' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>'
......You look curious. <cf>Of course, they're not just any pillars.
What you're looking for is the cane I used before I died.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I heard about it from an adventurer who had checked out the village of <cf>The pattern on the pillars looked familiar.
They must have used it as material to build the tent.
As expected, it's no longer usable as a weapon, but <cf>there should be a faint trace of my bio-engrams left.
I need you to kick <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and the rest of them to the curb.
I'll accompany you. <cf>I know I won't be able to help you fight.
While you're distracting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and the others, you could at least retrieve the engram from the <cf>cane.
Let's head to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" for now. <cf>I'll do the details on the way there.
Looks like the cane I used to use on ' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>' is left on <cf>
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>It has been made into a pillar in the tent of ......, though. <cf>I would like to retrieve my engram from that cane.
Let's go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" first. <cf>I will make detailed plans there. Thank you in advance.
Hmmm ....... Speaking of " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>," <cf>was known for being dotted with the ruins of Bapharia. ......
There seem to be more monsters than when I knew them. <cf>I used to see a lot of adventurers and scholars frequenting the area.
It's hard to explore the ruins now, isn't it? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>The "geeks" are walking around with their own faces. ......
I'm sorry, ....... <cf>I'm so quick to get lost in thought when something catches my attention.
Let's focus now on the cane used for the tent. <cf>Apparently it's in the woods.
If you hide yourself in the trees, even I can get close to you. <cf>I need you to distract <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>them as much as you can.
Well, don't think too much about it, just take them down and you'll be fine. <cf>I'll do my part and do it well.
If all goes well, we'll meet back here. <cf>Then, let's get to work.
I want you to take down the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>guys around here. <cf>That way we can get their attention.
I'll sneak into the camp and retrieve the <cf>engrams while I'm there.
I should be able to return by the time you finish defeating them. <cf>I'll meet you back here later.
Thanks for your time. Thank you. <cf>You've attracted <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and others well.
Thanks to you, I was able to recover the bio-engram from the cane.
Why is my cane, a Seilah, in the settlement of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>I bet you're wondering ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and Mooks, and there will be some <cf>engram manipulation, like Spell Caster?
Where did they develop their skills? <cf>And how are they passing it on?
Is there a class like Spell Caster's ....... <cf>This was my last minute 'quest' before I died!
That's why I visited the settlements on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
My own memory of that time is fuzzy. <cf>Perhaps I was killed by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>during the investigation.
I suppose that's why the cane was left behind.
Don't worry about it. <cf>That was hundreds of years ago.
Well. I wish the cane engrams were enough, but <cf>doesn't seem to work that way.
I must also find another one of my belongings.
Do you know a place called Berkmar? <cf>I lived in that area for a time.
There's no way there's any house left, but <cf>there must be at least a trace of it somewhere.
Let's follow the same process. <cf>Let's go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" first and see what happens.
I hear that Berkmar is an even more dangerous place than here. <cf>I need your help once again.
There must be some remnants of my time living in a place called Berkmar <cf>
I'm told I'm a changed man now. ...... <cf>I'm sure you can find at least a fragment of my bio-engram.
We want to collect that as well. <cf>Let's go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" first and see what's going on.
[--]It used to be a <cf>quiet neighborhood, as the name ' <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>' implies!
There are more noisy monsters in the world without our knowledge. <cf>No, it's not the only influence?
I'm sensing the lingering scent of something disastrous ...... strange.
It's very possible that the monster is getting more ferocious <cf>because of the presence of the monster.
It's a deep-seated problem. I have a feeling it's going to affect your adventures and 'quest' journey as well <cf>in no small way.
I'm curious to know the truth about that, but let's not get into that right now. <cf>I, as Seilah, have business to attend to first.
As usual, I need you to keep the <cf>monsters engaged while I retrieve the bio-engrams.
This time it's going to take longer than before. <cf>Maybe some of them will notice Engram's movements.
Especially <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>is sensitive to changes in engrams. <cf>If they are messed with, it can get very messy.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>Can you please help me take down the <cf>Try to rampage as spectacularly as possible.
I will hide behind it. <cf>When we're done, we'll each come back here.
I need you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>that is nesting in " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>".
I want an opening for me to retrieve the bio-engrams. <cf>If we take down some of them, they'll go away.
When we're done, we'll each come back here.
Welcome back. <cf>Everything went well. Thanks to you.
Thanks a lot. <cf>As a Seilah, this is enough for my biological engram.
[--] I remember just a little bit of the old days.
As a Seilah, I was also a Spell Caster before I became a <cf>Imagine!
His name is Slaft. <cf>I think I've contributed somewhat to the people, but I don't know if you've heard of ......
Either way, they died a long time ago. <cf>There is no way they should be allowed to take the body of someone who is living today.
As an Imagine, knowing the world of the future is <cf>an undesirable but distorted event.
...... I think the next time I ask you for something, <cf>you'll be ready to let Seilah go.
What could I, as Seilah, leave you with?
In any case, the next one will be my last. <cf>Please, please, please take care of them.
It's me, Seilah, and my real name is Slaft.
I guess I'm just one more step away from returning this body to Seilah <cf>
We cannot afford to make a mistake in packing. <cf>Things must be done carefully. ......
I am Seilah, and I am Thrift. <cf>I think it might be time for me to stop calling myself this.
The time to give this body back to Seilah is imminent. ...... <cf>I have a feeling that's coming.
Hi. <cf>I think I'm finally going to be able to give this back to Seilah.
I mean ...... there is no more grace. <cf>We must hurry and erase me, Seilah.
More and more often, Seilah does not answer my calls. <cf>She seems to be fading in and out of consciousness.
In addition, they are able to handle <cf>their skills more finely than before. An unwelcome sign.
It is proof that my will is operating more deeply <cf>in Seilah's body.
This will be the last time I ask you for a favor.
I will now perform the <cf>ritual to erase me, Seilah.
The last engram we need is the one contained in <cf>"Mayamar Mine"
I looked for it in town, but it is not for sale. <cf>Maybe because it's an ore with no noticeable value or power.
I'm the only one who needs something like this. <cf>And that's just for one ritual.
I want to hurry up and get the ritual preparations underway. <cf>In the meantime, I need you to collect the "Mayan Yarl ore" for me.
You can find them at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>'. <cf>Come back here when you are done.
I need you to collect <cf>"Mayan Yar Mine" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>".
I will stay here to prepare the ritual. <cf>You are so close to erasing me, Seilah.
You brought me "Mayamar Mine". <cf>Thank you. Well, here we go.
Seilah would be happy to hear that. <cf>...... Seilah?　Seilah?
I haven't heard back from you. ...... This is not good. <cf>I'm losing consciousness.
There is no time. Let's hurry.
The engrams I've collected from you so far have been <cf>crystallized and processed into a special mirror.
I need to have my reflection in this. <cf>In other words, I need someone to hold it for me.
I'm Seilah, someone who knows my situation and <cf>trusts me.
Come on, let's save the girl from the ghosts of her past.
No matter how much it stands out here, and <cf>there are so many people that it disrupts the flow of engrams.
There is a suitable place for this ritual. <cf>Let's head to Montegnor Valley.
'Melisos River Basin' is no problem. <cf>You'll have to escort me, Seilah.
Melisos River Basin" in the Montegnor Valley. <cf>We can perform the ritual there.
We should be able to save Seilah. <cf>We are running out of time. Let's hurry.
Arrival. <cf>This is the right place to erase me, Seilah.
It's a long way to go now that I think about it.
Yeah ...... there is a strong flow of natural engrams. <cf>Conditions would be perfect here.
I was pushed out of Seilah, <cf>to disperse into several engrams
And it will disappear into this stream. <cf>I imagine it's like scattering ashes in a river.
When that happens I'll ...... maybe <cf>know everything about the world!
That's a great moment to be a Spell Caster.
I was thinking ....... <cf>Looks like there's a janky one at the end.
Is this a herd of ...... Mook Warriors? <cf>Their biological engrams are disrupting the flow.
They're a bad bunch, aren't they? <cf>You don't have to hang out in a place like this.
If my engrams don't flow cleanly, <cf>I could end up back in Seilah's body again.
There is no time to collect engrams from scratch again. <cf>We have to make sure we make it right the first time.
[We have no choice but to resort to force. <cf>We will have to resort to the use of force here.
Fortunately I can't say ...... but <cf>I'm in a position to handle my skills too!
Let's work together and let the Mook Warriors <cf>leave!
A swarm of Mook Warriors is interfering with the ritual. <cf>Let us defeat them ourselves.
In one corner of the "Melisos River Basin" <cf>there should be a place where they hang out.
As far as Seilah is concerned, we'd better hurry. <cf>Now let's get going.
Looks like this is the place. <cf>The tracks of the Mukwarriors are gathering.
Hmmm, the engrams are thick too. <cf>If we don't let this dissipate, it will interfere with the ritual.
And ...... there's some loot lying around. <cf>A herd that has learned to attack people is dangerous.
Let's ask them to leave early, shall we?
...... Oh, sorry. <cf>Not the time for that, but I got sentimental.
I thought it would be the last time I would fight with you.
I guess it's called strange fate. <cf>I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be fighting alongside hundreds of years my junior.
Seeing a talented Spell Caster up close and <cf>quite a bit, I felt the future was bright!
It is an honor for someone like me to have had some part in the foundation of this era <cf>
A boring leave-behind, but finally <cf>remember this 'exposition' of the battle of Slaft!
Let's [--] get started!
[--] You're done. <cf>Yeah, the flow of engrams is calming down.
That was a brilliant move. Thank you. <cf>I couldn't have done it without your help.
Hmmm ...... the elation after a battle. <cf>I'm sorry to think this is the last time I'm going to do this, too.
No, this is no time for soaking it in. <cf>We have to put Seilah first.
Let's go back to where we were. <cf>This time, the ceremony should go off without a hitch.
I'm going to be in your hands for just a little while longer. <cf>Please forgive me.
Do you remember where the ceremony was held? <cf>Let's go back there.
This time nothing will hinder us. <cf>I should be able to return this body to Seilah.
We have come this far for that reason. <cf>We must not lose sight of our original purpose. Everything.
You're back. <cf>Now, I hope you won't tolerate any more trouble. ......
Climate and engrams are both fine. <cf>It doesn't look like the monsters are going to mess with us.
I've got my tools and I think I'm finally ready to go.
[--] Then let me begin my elimination.
Take the mirror that I, as Seilah, made and <cf>stand in front of it. That's all I ask.
Then I release the engram. <cf>The mirror reflects it and illuminates me, the Seilah.
Along the way, the materials you have gathered will act and <cf>turn them into a force that will push me out of Seilah.
I'd love to explain in detail [--] <cf>but no amount of time would be enough for that.
Exposition's" Slaft, the last skill.
Is this the last time that I, Seilah, will be known as ......? <cf>Thanks for sticking with me for so long.
You will make a good Spell Caster. <cf>I hope you and Seilah will be good friends for many years to come.
It was nice meeting you. <cf>Farewell. It's been a pleasure [--].
......n............ uu......
Oh, can we talk ......?　My body moves ......! <cf>Mr. Slaft!　Mr. Slaft!
......I guess they're really gone!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>Um, could you please allow me to talk to you in that place?
That place in Asterleeds: ....... <cf>I always stood, right there.
I used Mr. Slaft's Imagine over there.
Please let me tell you a story about Mr. Slaft at that place. <cf>It's a special place for me. ......
I would be happy to talk to you at <cf>in Asterleeds, where I have always been.
It's a special place for me and for Mr. Slaft.
Awww ....... <cf>My legs are dizzy~!
Let's see, that's the ocean over there. ...... <cf>Huh, I'm finally getting used to moving my eyes!
I see I'm back: ......
Greetings again. <cf>I'm Seilah, your Spell Caster.
I have been watching you and listening to your voice. <cf>Thank you so much for all you have done for me!
I used Slaft's Imagine here, <cf>Somehow it got replaced!
And ever since then, Mr. Slaft and I have been talking about <cf>all sorts of things.
I had half given up, but <cf>Mr. Slaft always apologized to me!
Plus, you're always encouraging me.
It's nice to have things back to normal. <cf>But I miss you, Slaft. ......
I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye properly. ......
...... Huh?　Oh, ...... in your pocket!
This is Slaft's Imagine Seed ......!
I see. ....... I see you stayed. ......
Mr. Adventurer. I, Mr. Slaft, will try to find a way to call you again <cf>correctly!
I have never had a <cf>"exploration" theme as a Spell Caster!
But you and Mr. Slaft gave us <cf>it!
Please watch me. <cf>I'll be a great Spell Caster.
I'll do my best to practice my skills and "explore" <cf>as much as you do!
Hello! <cf>It's me, Seilah, the Spell Caster.
Imagine is a lot to think about. <cf>I need to learn more and more!
I think I'll try the Imagine Institute. <cf>It's strange, but they say they have some excellent people. ......
Oh, you're interested in Heavy Smasher?
I can't get enough of the weight of a blow. <cf>If you let loose with a bang, you too will feel a great sense of satisfaction!
Yo!　You've become a Heavy Smasher. <cf>You've got another friend. Welcome to the club!
I'm Maschietta. Nice to meet you!
Until recently, I was with my master. <cf>Now I'm on my own.
[I got my ass kicked by a guy who said, "[Don't] stick with me forever." <cf>
Well, I guess that's a little recognition!
But I felt like I was missing something, you know? <cf>I wanted a fellow Heavy Smasher.
If it's okay with you, we can work together to clean up the request or something!
I'd better get used to handling weapons first. <cf>It's quite unique and unusual, isn't it?
I'll take care of it. <cf>I'll teach you everything I know!
I just got an <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Accepted a request to take them down. <cf>Just in time, right?　Come on, let's do it together.
I'll be waiting outside the gate. <cf>Come when you're ready!
If you're a Heavy Smasher, you gotta get used to the weapon. <cf>Let's take down <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>
I'll be waiting outside the gates of Asterleeds. <cf>Come quickly, will you?
Okay, you're here. <cf>Now, let me give you a quick rundown.
Heavy Smasher fights with this ball. <cf>It's a little heavy, but that's how specialized it is for a single blow.
With the force of the engram packed in the cartridge, <cf>the ball at the tip of this don　and pops out!
Hit him with <span size="Big">Boom! &lt;/&gt; and hit him!
And then, the ball comes back and you point it at your opponent again at ....... <cf>This is how Heavy Smashers fight.
You think I don't understand even if you explain it with your mouth?
Hahahaha!　I know what you mean! <cf>I'm the type of person who learns by heart.
Don't think too hard. <cf>All you have to do is hit the ball!
They say "practice makes perfect". <cf>Let's actually blow up some monsters!
<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>And they asked me to take down a few of them. <cf>If you kill a few of them, they'll learn on their own.
I'm going to go over there and blow some shit up. <cf>Meet me here when you're done.
All right!　Let's get this over with!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>" to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>!
Meet me here when you're done. <cf>Don't worry, I'll pay your share, too.
Oh, you've already taken down <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>You've got a pretty good point there!
What do you think?　I'm so glad you're feeling better! <cf>I'm feeling refreshed and sweaty too!
The romance of putting a big bang on a single blow! <cf>This is the charm of Heavy Smasher.
If you train hard enough, you won't lose even to a big one like the <cf>Ogre!
I had a great time today! <cf>And thanks for all the help with the request.
Let's go blow off some steam together again next time!
It's still nice to have a fellow Heavy Smasher <cf>!
It's better to be blown away by two people than by one!
How's your Heavy Smasher training going? <cf>Are you getting stronger?
Next time, I'd like to <cf>blow up something more crunchy than <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>!
Hey, how are you doing?
I need you to help me with a job today.
Actually, my mentor told me. <cf>[He said, "[Learn to] cooperate with your friends.
There was too much of a gap in ability between me and my mentor, and I didn't feel like <cf>a peer. ......
On that note, I'm sure Omae would feel like a fellow <cf>standing shoulder to shoulder with you!
I'm sure we'll be fighting Heavy Smashers together <cf>from now on, won't we?
I'm just trying to get a feel for it now.
The request is to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>A farmer in Minsterhorn was attacked by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
I'll explain the details there. <cf>In the meantime, let's meet up at Minsterhorn!
Alright, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>let's go take them down. <cf>Meet us at Minsterhorn.
Hey, you're here. <cf>I heard about you first.
A farmer's wife was attacked by <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and others when she was going to sell vegetables.
He wasn't hurt, but <cf>he left his vegetables behind to escape.
Obasan, I was depressed, man. That's unforgivable. ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I'm not convinced that it's just a matter of defeating them and that's it!
I learned it from my mentor. <cf>[I learned from my mentor that adventurers should make their clients smile.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>But, it's no laughing matter for Obasan if we blow off the "Mere Old Man". <cf>I have to get back my precious vegetables!
There should be some vegetables down near Minsterhorn. <cf>Let's collect them first.
I'll be there, let me know when you're done. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I'll pay you a big thank you afterwards!
There should be a crate of <cf>veggies down near Minsterhorn.
Let's collect that one first. <cf>Let me know when you're done. Then we'll go to <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and take them down!
Phew. <cf>Did we find all the vegetables now?
Thanks. <cf>I'll have to punish <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>then!
I was thinking of going to ......, but you and I are going our separate ways.
I just delivered some veggies I found to <cf>and the old lady was thrilled.
[I'm sorry, I didn't want to say it, but <cf>I actually left the fruit there too. ......["]!
Why didn't they just say so from the beginning?
So I'm off to find some fruit. <cf>You take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
In a way, <cf>might be just the thing for the role of Heavy Smasher.
Heavy Smasher's attack is. <cf>It doesn't just buzz the monster.
It's a weighted blow that can limit their movement and slow <cf>their start.
That's how you restrict and attract the enemy's movement. <cf>That's how Heavy Smashers fight.
So, while you're attracting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>I'll be collecting the fruit.
How's that? <cf>This is what "[ ]working with friends[ ]" is all about, right?
That's why I'm asking you to take them down at <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>They should be at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
I'm counting on you, buddy! <cf>Come back here when you're done!
Go <cf>and beat up the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>guys at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
I'll collect the fruits in the meantime. <cf>Come back when you're done!
Hey, good job! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Looks like we're done.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>If you can beat the "Mere Old Man," you're going to a good place. <cf>There are a lot of people who have a hard time.
I also found some fruit and delivered it all to <cf>Obasan!
Obasan, you made me so happy. <cf>It makes me happy to see her smile so much!
'I don't just want to think about what I'm asked to do, I want to think about what <cf>my client needs.'
This is my creed.
Well, it's mostly what I got from my mentor!
One day I will become a Heavy Smasher like my master. <cf>Master has always been my goal.
I'm actually on a journey to find my master. <cf>This is part of my training.
I've been given an assignment to find a mentor somewhere <cf>
I'd like to introduce you to my mentor. <cf>I'll call on you again soon!
Thanks a lot! <cf>You've done a great job, man!
Hey, how's it going? <cf>Let's go for another bang or something today!
I still don't know where the master went. <cf>Well, I'll keep looking.
I'd like to fight with you again, too! <cf>Let's go for a bigger fish this time. I'm looking forward to it!
I found a crate of vegetables.
Hey, how's it going? <cf>Are you getting used to fighting Heavy Smasher?
I think it's time for me to get a new weapon. <cf>You should try out your new one too.
Hey, nice to see you here! <cf>Can you do me a favor?
I was planning on going to <cf>another region soon to look for my mentor.
I just heard <cf>that a kid went missing in Minsterhorn.
He went to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" to pick up nuts and <cf>never came back.
It's not safe for kids to go out alone there. <cf>I hope you weren't attacked by a monster. ......
You can't leave this guy alone, can you?
And the people at Minsterhorn took care of me. <cf>It's so relaxing and cozy there.
I was taking care of some requests and <cf>remembered my face too.
I was in no time to be leisurely! <cf>Let's go find the kid right away!
' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>' would have had a garrison of the Bapharia Order at <cf>
Maybe you'll be protected there. <cf>Let's meet up at the garrison first!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>We'll meet up at the "garrison" in <cf>Maybe there's a kid there.
There are many nasty monsters in that area. <cf>Let's be ready for them.
Hey, good job! <cf>Looks like Minsterhorn's boy ain't here.
I didn't see you on the way here either. ...... <cf>Where have you wandered off to?
I had a similar experience a long time ago.
I was lost in the forest and attacked by a monster. <cf>My teacher was the one who saved me.
I was a kid, too, and I was scared. <cf>So I had to help him out!
Some of the stories look a little bad. ......
I heard that girl was collecting nuts. <cf>These are Rumblebore's favorite.
They might be following the kids around because of the smell.
Okay, let's divide the roles. <cf>You get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>.
If they could take down a few of them, the rest of the herd would run away.
When Heavy Smashers go on a loud rampage, even <cf>monsters know they're in trouble.
In the meantime, I'll look for the kid. <cf>I know what they look like. Maybe they'll recognize me.
I'm asking you. Don't be shy. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>I want you to blow up the "Mere Old Man" with a bang!
Take down <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" from <cf>one side to the other!
In the meantime, I'll find the kid. <cf>I'm counting on you. Don't be shy!
Hey, thanks for the help! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>Thanks for getting rid of the "Mere Old Man"!
See, this is what I'm talking about. <cf>I found the prankster boy and caught him.
Damn you, you know! <cf>I told you not to go far away by yourself.
Because these nuts are the most delicious.
I'll give some to my sister Maschietta. <cf>I can only get these at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>.
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>Don't talk like that. <cf>You're going to get blown away by this guy.
...... Yeah, it's good. <cf>I might have to come back and pick this up.
I know, right?
Anyway, I'm glad you found it. <cf>Thanks to you, man.
Well, I guess I'll walk you back to Minsterhorn. <cf>I'd hate to see you get lost by yourself again.
Sorry to drag you into this. <cf>Just hang out with me a little longer.
Let's send the kids to Minsterhorn.
Good work! <cf>I delivered that boy to his mother's place a step ahead of you.
I was so grateful to you, too. <cf>[He told me many times to take care of you.
Wow, it feels good after doing something good, doesn't it?
Maybe this is how the master felt. <cf>He was helping people all over the place.
I feel like I'm getting a little closer again. <cf>Well, I still can't reach him at all.
Well, I'm back to looking for my mentor.
They don't seem to be in Asteria Plain. <cf>I guess it's time to start looking elsewhere.
I'd like to introduce you to my mentor, <cf>and if you like, give me a shout again. See ya!
I'll be going around looking for a mentor, but <cf>I'm going to keep my lodging in Asterleeds!
This is where all kinds of stories come together.
If you see me, give me a shout. <cf>Don't go through that, okay?　You're gonna miss me.
Well, the master. <cf>I don't know where he is. ......
I might come to Asterleeds by chance. <cf>I can't leave this place.
Hey, man! <cf>Sorry to drag you into this again.
A while back, I went to <cf>Larpal looking for my mentor.
Then I heard something that caught my attention.
I heard that someone ransacked <cf>some food and packages that were in storage. ......
It's just like the last commission I worked on.
Well, technically, it's a request that my mentor Accepted.
When I was only half a man, <cf>we went to Larpal together.
......I have a bitter memory of it. <cf>I screwed up and got my mentor in trouble.
The luggage vandals at that time were monsters.
If that's the case this time, people in the city are in danger. <cf>I'm curious, and I need to find out.
I'd like to have a helper if possible. <cf>It would be great if you could come!
Let's go to Larpal first and gather some clues.
Talk to people in town, check out the baggage drop-off site, ....... <cf>We'll meet up with you there once we've gathered more information!
Let's go to Larpal, <cf>and gather clues as to who ransacked the luggage.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>Is there something you want to ask me?
Oh, you're talking about your luggage being ransacked.
Of course I know. <cf>And I saw it that night!
The herd of beasts that ran through the vicinity of the city!
I saw so many eyes glowing in the dark, <cf>and I even heard a roar!
I was so scared! <cf>I was afraid that if they found me, they would bite me.
What kind of beast was it?　Well, you're right: ......
They were like ...... wolves on four legs. <cf>They were small and quick.
There are <cf>several sharp scratches left around the luggage storage area.
They look like scratches inflicted by claws or fangs.
Maschietta is right, <cf>the luggage vandalism could be the work of a monster.
Hey, what's up? <cf>Did you find any clues on the luggage vandalism?
Hmmm... ....... <cf>Someone said they saw a herd of beasts and the scars from the claws and fangs.
I've found monster hairs and footprints, too.
I'm thinking ...... <cf>combined with the clues, it's <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>that trashed the luggage.
It was the same with me and my mentor.
They hunt in packs and they are smart. <cf>They know where to put their food.
I got rid of him that time, but <cf>he's not going to learn his lesson again.
That's some balls, man!
All right!　Let's finish this up. <cf>We'll take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>!
We need to teach them that human summers are scary. <cf>That way, they'll stay away from Larpal.
I think we're going to get nipped in the bud in one place. <cf>Let's go wild in two places, me and you!
Let's go after the guys at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>. They'll be coming to Larpal. <cf>They're probably on their way to Larpal.
We'll meet back here when we're done. <cf>Well then, let's get started!
Let's split up and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>! <cf>Don't leave <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>, okay?
Let's meet up here when you're done. <cf>This should keep Larpal quiet, you know.
Hey, good job! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>Looks like we're done with the "Mere Old Man".
All right, all right. <cf>If we've done all this, we're good to go.
I'm glad it all worked out. <cf>Thanks to your help, I guess.
I used to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>just like my mentor did. ......
There was this one guy who was really tough. <cf>He drove me into a corner.
If my master hadn't saved me, I would have been in real danger. <cf>I mean, the master was too cool at that time!
...... Oh, no. <cf>That's not what I wanted to talk about.
I was so disappointed. <cf>I was so pissed off because I dragged my mentor down with me. ......
So I'm really glad it went well today! <cf>I've grown up a lot since then.
Thank you! <cf>I'll definitely brag about you when I find my mentor!
We've got to find them quickly for that. <cf>All right!　Well, I'll go look for them again!
My mentor was so cool when he saved me <cf>
Like this, zap!　And then <cf>Boom!　and then you blow the monster out of the sky. ......
I've been admiring ....... <cf>Oh, master, where have you gone?
Remember the previous <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>debacle, remember?
I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. <cf>There wasn't even that strong guy. ......
Was that really the end of that thing ......?
Hey, you. <cf>Have you ever heard of the "Sapphire Trot"?
Didn't we have a Larpal once where <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>vandalized the <cf>luggage area?
The same thing happened again.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>A herd of <cf>was out in Larpal, and there was a leader at the head of the herd.
That's Sapphire Trot. <cf>I have a history with him.
I told you that my mentor and I fought <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>the same way back in the day.
I also told you about the time I almost got turned back by one of the stronger ones <cf>.
He had blue fur, <cf>and was definitely quicker, stronger and smarter than the others.
That's the "Sapphire Trot."
I didn't see him when I went with Omae. <cf>But I guess he was just hiding.
I've been watching from the shadows to see if we can get rid of the other <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>and <cf>to feel safe.
He'll do it, that yahoo. ......
Now that we're gone, "Sapphire Trot" can <cf>raid warehouses with impunity!
This doesn't make the people of Larpal feel safe. <cf>I can't make my clients smile!
Besides, I owe you for the old days.
I want to defeat the Sapphire Trot. <cf>I'm begging you. I need your help!
There must be someone in Larpal who saw him. <cf>Let's go talk to him.
Someone must have seen "Sapphire Trot" on Larpal at <cf>
We've got to get him this time! <cf>Let's get some intel on him first.
Have you seen "Sapphire Trot"?
Yeah, the luggage vandalism. <cf>We've had our share of calls.
Some said they saw ["]blue wolves ["].
They say they are terribly wary and clever monsters. <cf>They say it's known among the locals.
Are you looking for it too? <cf>Then you should look for Divine Haven Hill.
They seem to have made that area their territory. <cf>But it's going to be tough to find them.
We have yet to discover them. <cf>They don't show themselves in public easily.
The "Sapphire Trot" ......? <cf>Yeah, I know.
From a distance, but I've seen him a few times.
He has blue fur and is so beautiful. <cf>He looks so docile. ......
The truth is that <cf>is a much stronger and more dangerous monster than <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>
Don't let appearances deceive you. <cf>I tell my children this often.
Whereabouts?　Well, as expected, you can find out more at ......
But I've seen them near the city. <cf>I think they are somewhere in Divine Haven Hill.
Yo! <cf>Have you gathered any information on the "Sapphire Trot"?
Looks like he's the real culprit in the luggage vandalism after all.
You got away with it! <cf>Damn!　That ain't gonna happen this time!
But the key is where they are. <cf>Where are they hiding. ......
What?　You understand?
Somewhere on "Divine Haven Hill" ....... <cf>Well done, man!　That's awesome, dude!
All right, then!　Then the story is simple.
What do you think?　Me and you <cf>will blow the "Sapphire Trot" out of the water!
That yarrow is leading the pack. <cf>If we destroy the leader, the others will scatter.
They'll never try to attack Larpal again.
This time I'm going to make the people of Larpal smile. <cf>I'll also pay back all the debts I owe them from the past!
Let's go!　Let's go to the "Sapphire Trot" roost!
Looks like the "Sapphire Trot" is roosting somewhere in Divine Haven Hill <cf>
Once you know that, it's easy to talk. <cf>Come on, let's both go for a whirlwind ride!
If we take him down, the case is closed!
Okay, here it is: ....... I got a glimpse. <cf>The blue shadow of the Sapphire Trot.
Oops, my hands are shaking. <cf>What is it?　Is it a warrior's tremor? That's not like me.
Heh, to tell you the truth. <cf>I'm kind of looking forward to it.
I was beaten to a pulp before. <cf>I didn't think I could get revenge like this.
How much stronger have I become since then? <cf>I'm the best person to see how strong I've become since then!
Don't hide behind your master's back this time. <cf>You'll be fighting side by side with your friends!
All right, I'm getting into the spirit of things! <cf>You're ready too, right?
Sapphire Trot! <cf>Make them regret turning us against them!
Aaaaaaah! <cf>Did you see that, you son of a bitch!
Well, we did it! <cf>I beat that "Sapphire Trot"!
Thanks to your help. Thank you!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>The first one ran away, too. <cf>This is the end of this herd.
They don't have the intelligence or the balls <cf>to steal food from where people live.
Come on, let's go back to Larpal and report back to the guys.
It feels good to be able to go home with my chest out! <cf>I'll tell you all about your saga!
We were able to defeat the Sapphire Trot thanks to <cf>you coming with us!
Thank you! <cf>Now, let's go back to Larpal and report back to the guys!
Oh, good job! <cf>You really helped me out this time. Thanks a lot.
They were very grateful. <cf>They said they were glad to have an adventurer they could count on.
You could have complimented me a little, too.
Haha, just kidding, just kidding! <cf>You're the one who got me off my chest.
I've been thinking about <cf>how I've been pulling my mentor's leg.
The "Sapphire Trot" did what it wanted, and <cf>it was going to happen again this time.
But I finally got it all done.
And, best of all. <cf>The people of Larpal are safe now!
Your luggage won't be ransacked, and you won't be frightened of the <cf>"Sapphire Trot"!
If you think about it, it's like me and you cleaned up the master's unfinished work at <cf>!
Hehehe, this is good! <cf>Now I have a souvenir to tell my master!
Yessir!　Hold on, master! <cf>I'll find you soon!
Let's both brag about it! <cf>I heard there's more to that case that you don't know!
I've met a lot of Heavy Smashers, but <cf>you're kind of special.
It helped me to shake off my past and <cf>I feel like a 'pal' in many ways.
Maybe the master was trying to tell us to look for guys like this <cf>
As a senior Blitz Lancer, <cf>how should I teach my juniors ......?
I don't want to look uncool. <cf>I want to show that I'm dependable!
Hey there!　Are you the new Blitz Lancer?
My name is Clint! <cf>I'm your senior. Nice to meet you!
I'm going to teach you the <cf>basics of being a Blitz Lancer.
I would love to see you <cf>become a strong Blitz Lancer in your own right!
Actually, I was a senior when I was just starting out. <cf>Now, as a senior, I want to help my juniors.
So as a senior, I want to practice teaching younger students! <cf>You, come hang out with me for a minute.
Don't worry! <cf>I've been a Blitz Lancer for a while.
First of all, ...... yes. <cf>Blitz Lancer still needs to be able to fight.
All right!　Let's go out there and start taking down some monsters right away.
There is <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>on " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>". <cf>Let's practice the Blitz Lancer technique against them!
Meet me just outside Asterleeds. <cf>Don't be late, junior!
All right!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Let's take them down. Let's go!
First, I need to know what features Blitz Lancer has in the <cf>class.
The best thing about Blitz Lancer is that it <cf>gives the opponent an "imprint"!
The 'imprint' is a weakness, so to speak. <cf>Give them a weakness, and they will exploit it!
When you poke it, give it another "imprint"!　Then poke!
Repeating this process is the basic strategy of the <cf>Blitz Lancer.
Sounds easy, right? <cf>And yet, it's so much deeper than that.
All right!　Let's put it into practice. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Let's use the "imprint" on your opponent and fight!
I'm going to go out there and take them down too. <cf>It's not a good idea to let only junior members of the team do it!
When you're done, we'll meet back here!
Try to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>"! <cf>And try to use your Blitz Lancer skills!
<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Defeat, are you done?　Good work!
You're ...... Blitz Lancer's junior, right? <cf>Really?
I couldn't get it right the first time. <cf>I had help from my seniors.
Is that ......?　I'm a senior and don't need ......?
Nope!　No, no, no, we're not there yet! <cf>The road to Blitz Lancer is long and hard!
I should <cf>be a senior too, so I can mentor the juniors. I'm going to have to get a job!
Thanks for today! <cf>I'll let you know about Blitz Lancer some other time.
You can also help me practice over there <cf>so that I can be more like a senior. Thanks for your time!
What should I tell you next: ......
I'm bored if I just fight all the time. <cf>I'd like to do something to keep him occupied.
Hey, man!　How's it going? <cf>Have you become a better Blitz Lancer?
As for me, I still have a lot to teach you <cf>......
Just fighting monsters all the time is boring. <cf>I've been there. I know exactly what you mean.
So I Accepted the request, this time at the Pioneer Bureau.
While we're getting this guy out of the way, let's also practice <cf>Blitz Lancer!
Of course, I'll pay you well. <cf>I will not have my seniors all to myself!
The request is to collect "Red and Blue Violets" at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
But it looks like <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>is around where the 'red and blue violets' are growing.
Every time you need a "red and blue violet," <cf>it's hard to ask the Bureau of Reclamation, isn't it?
So let's get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>ourselves!
Well then, we're off to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>! <cf>I'll meet you at Minsterhorn!
Pioneer Bureau request and Blitz Lancer practice. <cf>Wouldn't it be more efficient if we could do them together?
Well then, let's meet up at Minsterhorn first.
Well, here we are. <cf>Let's collect "red and blue violets" first!
This one is a request from the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I'll have to remember that.
I'll go check on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>while I'm there. <cf>The seniors need to take the lead on the dangerous stuff!
Don't worry about you, just collect the "red and blue violets".
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>You can fight with the "Mere Old Man," but don't be too hard on yourself. <cf>I'll teach you how to fight later.
When you're done collecting, come back here!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>Let's collect "Red and Blue Violets" at the <cf>It's a request from the Pioneer Bureau, so we have to remember to do it.
I'll go check on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>while I'm there. <cf>Come back here when you're done collecting.
Hey, good job! <cf>Did you find the "Red and Blue Violets"?
Let's see. ....... <cf>Yeah, it looks like I got the numbers right. Thanks!
I checked out the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>one too.
There were quite a few. That one might get close to <cf>Minsterhorn one of these days.
Let's keep their numbers down before that happens.
Didn't I tell you before <cf>that Blitz Lancer can give you an "imprint"?
That's how Blitz Lancer was standing at the time.
The basic rule of thumb is to distance yourself immediately after an attack. <cf>If you get greedy and try to attack repeatedly, it will hurt you.
Don't be in a hurry. You have to put in one blow at a time. <cf>It's dangerous to be surrounded by other monsters.
You know, what people who've been there are saying is compelling. <cf>......Yeah. It was really bad then. ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>is a herd, I think. <cf>Avoid dealing with the whole herd.
Try to fight it like you're going to do a lot of one-on-one fights.
All right!　Let's go then, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>take down!
Let's split up and get rid of them! <cf>When we're done, we'll meet at our usual spot in Asterleeds.
Let's use the Blitz Lancer technique to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>!
Split up and get rid of them. <cf>When you're done, meet me at the usual place in Asterleeds!
Wow!　You're done defeating them already!
Yeah. ...... I worked so hard and <cf>just barely finished one step early. ......
The first time I <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>took longer to take it down, <cf>even though I had a senior help me ......
Damn, I like it. ...... <cf>I'm jealous that you're so strong. ...... gusu......
Ha!　I'm not crying!　I'm not crying! <cf>Seniors don't cry!
...... but I really envy you. <cf>You're so cool, even though you're my junior.
Me. There's someone I admire, like a master.
He's a Blitz Lancer, a senior Blitz Lancer I've been working with, <cf>who's also a senior adventurer.
Someday, I want to be a strong and <cf>reliable senior like that guy.
Something tells me you're not quite the <cf>junior I imagined you to be. ......
But I'm still a senior, so I'm still a senior!
I'm going to train harder so I don't lose to you, my junior! <cf>I'll need your help again, so I'll be looking forward to working with you next time!
Once you get used to Blitz Lancer, <cf>you should stick to weapons, too!
It's part of your ability to use the right weapon for you. <cf>Oh, you're talking like a senior, me!
Haha ....... <cf>Sorry to ask you to do something so unseemly.
I took on two requests at once.
I need you to collect a plant called "roadside starflower" and take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>
Both of them are to be done in Bahamar Highland. <cf>I didn't have enough hands to do it alone. ......
Sorry! <cf>Think of me as a no-good senior, please help me!
Actually, I heard that my senior is coming to Larpal. <cf>You see, that's the senior I told you about, the one I've been taking care of for you.
I wanted to show them a good side anyway, so I <cf>Accepted a few too many requests. ......
I need you to collect "starflowers by the roadside. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>I'll take down the
I'm a senior!　Leave the dangerous stuff to me!
Maybe you can come to me when you get <cf>together, since you'll probably be done faster than me.
I'm at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland. <cf>You can find "Roadside Star Grass" there.
I'll be looking forward to working with you!　See you later!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland, <cf>and pick up some "Roadside Star Grass".
I'm working on <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>taking down <cf>so come to me when you're done.
Ugh, ugh... ....... <cf>Such a pathetic ...... gush!
Wow!　Oh, you! <cf>No, I'm not crying!　I'm not crying!
...... lie. Sorry, I was crying: ......
...... a bit of a shambles.
I'm ...... really not that good at fighting monsters, <cf>
I can do it reasonably well now, but when I first started <cf>Blitz Lancer, it wasn't at all.
I taught you that Blitz Lancer is all about one-on-one, right? <cf>But sometimes I'm afraid of it.
I was glancing at <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>earlier and <cf>suddenly got stuck.
Then he blew me off and got away.
You got on a roll and took on two ...... and then <cf>I started crying because I was so pathetic.
Gosh ......, it's embarrassing and frustrating, but <cf>the most important thing right now is to finish the request!
Sorry again. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>Could you please also take down the dead?
My hands are shaking and I can't get a good grip on the spear.
I think I've slightly twisted my leg too. <cf>I'll just sit here and wait quietly.
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>and come back to us. <cf>Please do me a favor!
Take down <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>for me. <cf>I know it sounds pathetic, but please do me a favor.
I'll stay here and be quiet. <cf>I'll see you back here when you're done.
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>You beat the "Mere Old Man"! <cf>Thank you!　You saved my life.
...... haha. <cf>I was totally spinning my wheels this time, wasn't I?
I decided to become an adventurer because I wanted to be strong. <cf>I simply wanted to be strong.
I lost my parents early and I was very frail. <cf>I've always been a pain in the ass to be around.
I tried to at least work out, but it wasn't <cf>quite as easy as I wanted it to be. ......
The one who approached me then was a senior I admire.
He taught me how to train my body, how to be an adventurer, <cf>and most of all, how to be a Blitz Lancer.
That's how I got to be a Blitz Lancer.
But facing the enemy one-on-one was <cf>something I couldn't overcome until the end.
I thought I could show my <cf>seniors how much I've grown if I took down <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>here in a big way.
I'm so disappointed. ...... They're treating me like a child again. ......
...... No time to cry. Gosh. <cf>I had a client waiting for me.
Let's deliver "Star Grass by the Roadside" to Larpal. <cf>I don't want to see my senior at ...... for a bit.
Ah!　You are the adventurer who Accepted our request, aren't you?
This is indeed "Roadside Star Grass". <cf>Thank you.
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>I also took down a <cf>junior staff, not me, though.
So I heard ...... that there are other adventurers here besides us <cf>
Oh, you're the one who said you were looking for that legendary spear <cf>Blitz Lancer.
I had a request to take down another monster. <cf>I finished successfully and left a little while ago!
Crossing paths, huh? <cf>I'm both disappointed and relieved. ......
Is that guy still looking for the legendary spear?
That's what he said. <cf>I think it was ...... "Zenith Shaft"?
He's my senior, after all. <cf>That guy is looking for a spear called "Zenith Shaft".
It's a spear from an old legend. <cf>They say it's been in the hands of all kinds of brave men.
Of course, it may not exist, <cf>and even if it did, it would be in tatters.
Still, he wanted to make sure.
If I find a "Zenith Shaft" <cf>I wonder if I can get my seniors to approve of it ......
U...... was right. I was trying to look good like this <cf>and got you in trouble. Sorry.
But I'm glad I asked you. <cf>Because my senior told me before.
[Don't try to do it alone. Don't try to do it alone.
Thanks for this time. <cf>I hope you'll let me return the favor someday.
Don't try to do everything alone. <cf>Don't try to do everything alone.
That's what my senior said to me. It's true.
Looks like my senior is still looking for the legendary spear.
If I find a clue, I'll see if I can be of help to my seniors. <cf>No. ......
If I ever find that spear, <cf>you'll be more surprised.
Hey, you. <cf>Do you remember the spear called "Zenith Shaft"?
See? I told you about it on the last commission, remember? <cf>That's the legendary spear that my senpai is looking for.
Actually, I'm trying to find a "Zenith Shaft".
If I could find it before my seniors, I would feel very confident.
Even if you didn't find it, <cf>I'm sure it's not absolutely useless.
It's not enough to just admire seniors. <cf>We need to take action, get results, and be recognized.
But I'm afraid I might screw up again if I go it alone. <cf>I need your help. I'm counting on you.
So, you know. I was doing some research and found someone who knows about <cf>"Zenith Shafts"!
A merchant in Litze said he would tell me about <cf>"Zenith Shaft" as a reward for my request.
I'd like to go talk to him right away, if that's okay.
The request is to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>which appears on " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"
It's not that hard, let's just get it over with!
I've been told <cf>that the "Zenith Shaft" appears to the brave. Would be great if it came to us.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>After defeating the "Mere Old Man," we will meet at Litze!
Let's take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"!
When you're done, we'll meet at the Litze. <cf>Let's go talk to the client about the "Zenith Shaft".
Gghh...... ugh...... damn....... <cf>I'm so sorry. ...... ugh ......!
You're still a crybaby, Clint. <cf>It's time for you to calm down. ...... hmm?
Who are you?　You know Clint?
Oh, ...... you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>Are you done defeating the
Mr. Rugel. <cf>This is my junior Blitz Lancer.
Oh, I see! <cf>Clint told me about you. He said you have some great juniors.
My name is Rugel. Nice to meet you. <cf>I used to take care of Clint.
Oh, Clint? <cf>I intercepted the prize. I did a bad thing.
No, it wasn't!　I got caught off guard and ...... <cf>that's where Mr. Rugel saved me.
I've been seen in a shabby place again. ...... ugh ......
You're not ready for this, Clint. <cf>Well, it's better if you cry tears.
Here, tend to your wounds. <cf>You were hit pretty hard.
Yeah. ....... ...... Huh?　Eh, no!
You dropped "Massey's Secret Medicine" ......!
The "Massey's elixir"?　Is that the stuff I used to do?
Oh man. I'd love to find you, but ...... <cf>I've got my own request, and I've got to get going.
I'm sorry. Can I leave you in charge?
Clint won't be able to move for a while. <cf>Find him the "Mashie's elixir" for me.
Clint, don't let your guard down again. See you later.
Sorry ....... I didn't mean to bother even you.
The "Mathie's Elixir" is like a good luck charm for <cf>me.
It's a precious thing that Rugel gave me. ......
It should be somewhere on the "Ritze Tradeway. <cf>Find it and bring it to me.
The "Massey's Elixir" is like a <cf>talisman that Rugel gave me.
Found a small medicine bottle.
It seems to be the "Mashie's Secret Medicine" that Clint was looking for. <cf>I will deliver it to Litze.
The "Massey's Secret Medicine", have you found it?
Indeed, this is it!　Thanks!
This medicine was found by Mr. Rugel at the ruins.
When I was starting out, they used <cf>when I was injured like now. It works well, man.
So he gave me the rest. <cf>He said it was too little and I could use the rest in case of emergency.
I was taking good care of it, but I can't believe I dropped it. ...... <cf>And now, after being rescued by Mr. Rugel, I'm in this mess.
As a Blitz Lancer and as an adventurer <cf>I'm pathetic ...... ugh, gosh!
...... Damn, how long are you going to keep fretting, me? <cf>You're in the middle of a request!
Sorry. <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>Defeating the client was the main issue, wasn't it? <cf>The client is in Litze. Let's go report.
I know I took a detour, but I have to tell you about <cf>"Zenith Shafts".
Thanks for finding "Massey's Secret Medicine".
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>The main issue was to take down the <cf>The client is a merchant from Ritze. Let's go report.
Oh, are you the adventurer who defeated <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>and gave us <cf>?
Yeah, that's right. <cf>but this guy did most of the work for me.
You can pay this guy. <cf>I've got other things I want you to teach me.
I heard that you know about "Zenith Shaft" <cf>merchant.
Is it "Zenith Shaft"? Yes, I know it. <cf>It's the legendary spear that gives off a blue light.
I met an adventurer with a spear like that <cf>years ago!
He said it was a spear he found in an archaeological site somewhere.
It was battered and looked useless as a weapon, but <cf>it was indeed glowing blue!
However, the owner seems to have gone <cf>missing in the middle of defeating the monster!
I haven't seen them since then either!
Okay. ....... <cf>So you don't know where it is now.
I am sorry about that. <cf>By the way, there is a person who heard the same story.
I thought you said Mr. Rugel.
Is this a story that Mr. Rugel already knows? <cf>Well, of course you do.
Hmmm, I guess it is indeed hard to find <cf>"Zenith Shaft" before Mr. Rugel ......
No, you can't give up that easily! <cf>Then I'm no different than I've always been.
I'll look more into that adventurer and the blue glowing spear at <cf>
I showed Mr. Rugel how pathetic I am this time. <cf>And you too. So I have to make up for it!
I will find you, "Zenith Shaft"! <cf>I'll play with Mr. Rugel!
A clue in "Zenith Shaft," <cf>and still unknown to Mr. Rugel: ......
I'm sure you've already looked into legends and ruins. <cf>Then what's left to do?
Hey, thanks for your help! <cf>I think I'm going to go take down an ogre this time.
I'm a little curious about something. <cf>It may have something to do with "Zenith Shaft."
You said the merchant in Litze met an <cf>adventurer with a shiny blue spear.
I have a feeling that the place where that adventurer went missing and the place where the <cf>ogre appears are close to each other.
It's still just my hunch.
The Pioneer Bureau keeps records of adventurers who belong to the Bureau. <cf>I'd like to check there first.
If it has anything to do with "Zenith Shaft," <cf>of course I'm going to go take down the Ogre.
I need your help then. Best regards!
First, let's go to the second floor of the Pioneering Department. Let's check the shelves.
The "Zenith Shaft" appears before the brave ....... <cf>I'll find it before Mr. Rugel does!
The records of adventurers who may have had "Zenith Shafts" should be on file at <cf>in the archives of the Pioneer Station.
Let's check there first. <cf>Does it have anything to do with the Montegnor Valley auger ......?
I found it! <cf>The records of the adventurers who owned the "Zenith Shaft."
It says, "["]An adventurer with an ancient spear that glows blue ["]. <cf>This is it, no doubt!
That's a record from a few years ago. <cf>["]Received a request to take down an ogre in the Melisos River Basin["]......
After that, ...... ["]did not return and no contact was made ["]......[/]......[/]......[/]. <cf>["]The request is considered to have been unsuccessful["]......
Hmmm, maybe I don't have a choice, but ...... <cf>I wouldn't want to be on record as such.
...... hmm?　This auger ....... <cf>Hasn't it been absent since the request?
Maybe ...... adventurers didn't win, but <cf>could have hunted down the ogre!
So, maybe the auger that was healing its wounds <cf>has recently started to ramp up again!
I'm curious. <cf>I guess I should actually check it out after all.
Okay, let's go to the "Melisos River Basin"! <cf>There may be traces of "Zenith Shaft" and adventurers!
Looks like an ogre appeared in Montegnor Valley <cf>and fought an adventurer with a "Zenith Shaft".
Let's go to "Melisos River Basin"! <cf>You may find traces of "Zenith Shaft" and adventurers!
Mr. Rugel!
What's wrong with you? <cf>You are badly injured, aren't you?
Clint ...... and you too ......
I heard that an adventurer with a "Zenith Shaft" came to <cf>this area. ......
While investigating, I came across an ogre. <cf>An ogre with a battered spear on his back.
That's ...... "Zenith Shaft"!
Yeah. I got distracted by that guy, too. <cf>And then he took advantage of the opportunity and here we are.
Mr. Rugel, did you come here alone?　That's absurd.
[Don't try to go it alone. Take care of your friends ["]"] <cf>even though Mr. Rugel taught me to do so.
'Zenith Shaft' is a personal obsession of mine. <cf>I just don't feel comfortable bringing anyone else into it.
Then you can tell me at ......
...... Mr. Rugel. Use this.
The Secret Medicine of Massey" ......? <cf>It's gone, isn't it? It's useless.
It's okay. Use it and rest.
We'll take down the Ogre. <cf>And we'll get our hands on the Zenith Shaft.
Clint...... you, you're dealing with an ogre. <cf>Are you going to be okay?
If I were alone, I don't think I could do it. <cf>On the contrary, I think I'd be panicking and crying.
But now I am calm. <cf>I have friends I can count on to be with me.
I'm sorry I decided to do this on my own. <cf>Will you fight the Ogre with me?
Thank you! <cf>I knew you would come with me!
...... You've grown up, Clint.
I'm a Blitz Lancer too. <cf>I can't keep saying pathetic things.
Let's go! <cf>Let's defeat the Ogre and get the "Zenith Shaft"!
The ogre that had the "Zenith Shaft" should be somewhere in <cf>the Melisos River Basin.
It's probably some kind of trophy or something. <cf>Don't worry about it, it's not going to be used as a weapon.
Nevertheless, the ogre itself remains dangerous. <cf>Don't let your guard down.
But still, that Clint guy ....... <cf>He's getting cocky now.
There it is, that auger. ......
Looks like this is the place to sleep. <cf>The "Zenith Shaft" is lying near ......
I can't just take that one back with me. <cf>We still have to defeat the Ogre.
No, I'm fine, okay? <cf>I've been planning on fighting from the beginning.
Mr. Rugel got beat up, and I don't feel comfortable <cf>giving him back!
I'm a Blitz Lancer! <cf>I can't stay silent while my friends are getting hit!
Come on, brace yourself!　Ogre! <cf>We will take you down!
Ha, ha ...... and yay ......
<span size="Big">Yay! &lt;/&gt;
We did it, didn't we? <cf>We killed the ogre!　We did it!
Ha-ha-ha!　It's all thanks to you! <cf>I beat that ogre!　That's awesome!
[--]Ah!　Yes, "Zenith Shaft"!
No, no, no. I almost forgot. <cf>So this is the "Zenith Shaft": ......
It's old and battered. <cf>But it sure gives off a blue glow.
The legendary spear that Mr. Rugel was looking for.
...... What?　[The spear that appears in front of a brave man? <cf>There was a legend about that.
And if I said that, the ogre would be brave too. <cf>Maybe it's not about me.
Come on, let's go back to Mr. Rugel! <cf>He'll be glad to see this spear!
We were able to defeat the ogre and got <cf>the "Zenith Shaft".
Best result!　Thank you! <cf>Now let's go back to Mr. Rugel!
You're back. <cf>...... by the looks of it, it looks like you made it.
Hehehe ...... <span size="Big">Ta-da! &lt;/&gt;
What do you think?　Mr. Rugel! <cf>This is the "Zenith Shaft," a spear that emits blue light!
Oh, no doubt about it. <cf>It's the "Zenith Shaft" I've been looking for.
I never thought Clint would beat me to it.
I finally did it!
Great job. Clint. <cf>You won't be frightened in battle anymore, will you?
Oh, by the way, when I fought the ...... ogre, I didn't even think <cf>that it was scary!
It's proof that you're really strong.
On top of that, I have such great friends. <cf>I couldn't have done that as a loner.
Let me thank you too. <cf>Thank you for helping Clint.
He fought not alone, but together. <cf>This must have been a great experience for Clint.
Clint. You joined forces with your friends so you could get <cf>the "Zenith Shaft".
You are the real brave one who deserves this spear.
Mr. Rugel ...... ugh, ugh, ugh ...... <cf>ugh, ugh, ugh ......!
What, are you crying again?
This is a happy cry! <cf>I'm so happy that Mr. Rugel recognized me. ......
Gosh, ugh! <cf>But even Mr. Rugel is one of us!
From now on, as a fellow Blitz Lancer, <cf>I'll fight with you too!
Pfft, you're being cheeky. ...... <cf>All right. Take care of it, buddy.
Yes, sir!
Thanks for all your help! <cf>Seniority or not, it didn't matter to you.
Teaching you has allowed me to reevaluate some things. <cf>Above all, you have helped me grow.
Someday, I'll save your life! <cf>I can't say it enough times. Thank you so much!
I left the "Zenith Shaft" with the Pioneering Bureau. <cf>As part of my legacy, they gave it to me as research material.
In any case, it was too battered to be <cf>usable as a weapon.
To be able to fight without having to rely on the legendary spear. <cf>I need to keep training more and more!
Han!　If you're gonna pick a class, how about <cf>Beat Performer?
It's a one-of-a-kind class that combines sound and battle. <cf> I'm so excited!
It's a new class and we need to show everyone what we're all about. <cf>If you're interested, too, give it a shot!
Han!　I'm glad you're here! <cf>I'm Glen, the beat performer.
Are you like a new beat performer? <cf>Then you're just like me. I'm looking forward to working with you!
Beat Performers is a relatively new class. <cf>Shallow history, if you will.
Compared to Aegis Fighter and others, <cf>it's treated as a recently created class.
Maybe that's why I don't think the real appeal of beat performers <cf>is properly known by everyone.
There is no class of beat performers as hot, cool, <cf>cool as the coolest class of beat performers!
But people don't get it. <cf>So I decided to make a big show of it!
First of all, why don't you try to complete one request? <cf>It's to take down Uribo in "Skyquake Fields.
Hmm?　Is this a two-man job? <cf>Well, you know, it's Uribo.
To put it bluntly, it was so low-key that no one would take it on. <cf>The people at the Pioneer Bureau were having a bit of a hard time with it.
That's why. What if we beat performers <cf>took this guy on and did it perfectly?
Do what others don't do! <cf>It's a great way to build a reputation as a beat performer, isn't it?
Han!　I've got a good idea myself! <cf>It's the little things like this that keep us going.
Well, since we both have to get ready, <cf>let's meet up outside the gates of Asterleeds.
Don't go ahead by yourself, okay? <cf>See you later. Take care!
We're going to Skyquake Fields to take down Uribo. <cf>It's not a big opponent, but let's get ready for it.
I'll meet you outside the gates of Asterleeds later. <cf>Don't go ahead of me alone, okay?
Han!　Looks like we're ready! <cf>Let's go, let's take down Uribo!
The beat performer's main job is to support his friends. <cf>It is better to fight with someone else to shine!
Now that we're at this point. Let's review a few things.
When it comes to beat performers, the first thing you need is this weapon. <cf>A weapon that looks like a musical instrument...... or a musical instrument that looks like a weapon?
Well, anyway!　Using this thing to make the sound <cf>resonate is the essence of a beat performer!
The sound of a beat performer has many effects, such as strengthening allies, <cf>attacking enemies, etc.
Bring the battle to your advantage with sound. <cf>That's the role of the beat performer.
Of course, the beat performers themselves can also fight. <cf>Weapons are designed for hand-to-hand combat.
You can't say <cf>that you can't do anything without your friends.
This time, our opponent is Uribo, who is in the "Skyquake Fields. <cf>With this, we can fight alone.
I mean, I don't know if I'd want to stop by Uribo and <cf>bump him off. ......
You and I will take down three each. <cf>If we each kill three of them, the job is done.
Well, let's get this over with! <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done.
Han!　[I'm on a rolling boil! <cf>It's going to sound good today!
I'm going to take out three Uribos each from the Skyquake Fields. <cf>I think this will be quick and easy.
Han!　I guess that's what you call a beat performer's shoulder. <cf>Let's get this over with!
We'll meet back here when you're done, okay? <cf>Well, take care of it, buddy!
Oh, good job! <cf>Looks like it's over, the Uribo defeat!
I could hear a good sound. <cf>You've got some serious chops and taste!
Thanks to you, the request is complete. <cf>Han!　I'm proud to report it. Thank you!
If we can get results like this, <cf>it will improve the image of beat performers!
There are some hard-headed people in this world. <cf>Han!　I think we can make them look up to us.
Because they always look at me with a scornful eye. <cf>Even beat performers are in a class of their own.
I'm sorry, I've been complaining about it at ......! <cf>I'm sorry! Please don't listen to me.
Anyway, I'll continue to work steadily as a beat performer <cf>
If you feel up to it, you can help me out. <cf>It felt really good to work with you.
I'd be happy to have a session with you! <cf>See you soon!　Thanks!
The beat performers are getting better known, man. <cf>Han!　I feel like I'm getting a good reputation!
But the young guys are fine. <cf>The reaction of the old guys is still not so good.
Well, let's keep the appeal steady. <cf>There is no doubt that beat performers are the best!
Yo!　How's your beat-performing career going? <cf>Are you making a good sound?
I ain't worried about you, though. <cf>I'm sure you're raising your stock of beat performers.
I think more people know about beat performers than ever before <cf>
So, I found another request that no one wants to do <cf>. I just accepted it.
This is a chance for beat performers to show off their skills! <cf>Again, we need your help...
The client is the apothecary of Minsterhorn, <cf>, and the contents are to gather ingredients for the potion and defeat the monsters.
Seems like a decent request, right? <cf>But this client, a druggist, is a bit of a fussy one.
She's a bigoted bitch, and <cf>adventurers are shunning her all over the place.
That's where we beat performers come in!
I'm used to dealing with hard-headed people. <cf>I'm used to dealing with hard-headed people.
If anyone says anything, just let it pass. <cf>You concentrate on the request.
Well, let's go to Minsterhorn first. <cf>Let's go see that bigoted Baa.
The client is Baa, a pharmacist in Minsterhorn. <cf>Let's go talk to him first.
I hear she's a bigoted old lady. <cf>Leave it to me. I'm used to dealing with people like that.
The more hard-headed they are, the more they will nag <cf>at the beat performers.
Well, it doesn't matter for this request. <cf>Let's go to Minsterhorn as soon as possible!
What is it, you guys? <cf>What do you want in this deserted apothecary?
Don't rely on drugs, young man. <cf>Eat and sleep!　That's how most people get well.
No, no, no, I'm here at the request of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>You're looking for ingredients for medicine, right?　Baa.
Ah?　Are you adventurers? <cf>Why are you dressed like such a bunch of nerds?
You don't know what you're talking about. <cf>We are beat performers!
Well, I don't know what young people do. <cf>Well, as long as they do their job, that's all that matters.
All right. So what should I bring?
'Kisuri Grass', 'Cool Breeze Stone', and 'Cammi Shell'. <cf>Go find all three types.
And after that, we had to take down the Skyfish. <cf>They gobble up all kinds of medicinal materials.
I've got a client waiting for her meds, so <cf>I'll let you get the material collection out of the way first.
If that instrument or weapon or whatever it is <cf>isn't a decoration, it won't take long.
You're a woman of a few words, aren't you? <cf>Can't you just ask for it?
It's a decent request, I'm sure if you asked for it normally <cf>someone would have done it for you, right?
Hmm!　I'm not going to wish on <cf>those who choose their requests based on people's attitudes.
If you don't like it, go home. <cf>That's the extent of being a beat performer.
Han!　You're telling me! <cf>Beat performers never say two words!
I'm not going to throw a request away once I've Accepted it! <cf>I'm going to clean up the mess, so watch me!
All right, let's go! <cf>First, let's gather the ingredients...three kinds, right?
Kisslis grass", "cool breeze stone", and "kammi shells". <cf>You can find all of them in "Minster Hills".
Kisuri Grass", "Cool Breeze Stone", and "Cammi Shell". <cf>These three are the ingredients of the medicine.
You'll find them all in Minster Hills. <cf>I'll let you take care of that first.
I also asked him to take down the skyfish after that. <cf>That should be easy enough for any adventurer.
Show them that being a beat performer is more than just what you <cf>appear to be!
I found "Kisuri Grass".
I found "Cool Breeze Stone".
I found a "kanmi shell".
Alright, you've gathered your materials! <cf>Good job, man. Thanks for the help.
So that's it for materials. <cf>Next up, taking down the skyfish.
Damn, that old man is rough around the edges. <cf>No wonder adventurers don't come around here.
Well, we wouldn't throw <cf>a request like that!
Skyfish are in "Minster Hills". <cf>Defeating them is not that difficult.
I thought you said you had customers waiting for their meds. <cf>I think they're going to complain if I don't deliver the materials first: ......
What the hell!　I'm going to run and deliver the materials to <cf>Baa!
You go ahead and start taking them down. <cf>I'll be right there.
They asked us to take them out three at a time. <cf>Let's get this over with!
You go ahead and take down the Skyfish. <cf>Looks like you only need to take down three.
I'm going to deliver the ingredients for the medicine to Baa. <cf>I'll be right there after that.
When we are done defeating them, let's go to Baa to report back to him. <cf>Well then, I'll be looking forward to working with you!
Hey, Baa-san! <cf>I've cleaned up the mess just like you said.
I collected the ingredients for the medicine and the skyfish were <cf>cleanly defeated. I ain't complaining, am I?
Hmm, I heard some loud music. <cf>I didn't know adventurers these days fight like that.
If you make that much noise, <cf>the monsters won't be attracted to you.
At least say thank you!
Oh, well, that's okay. <cf>Well, we're going home now.
Wait for me. The loud one over there. <cf>You need your medicine. Take it.
I'm sure you're proud of your <cf>sound if you're still skinning your fingers.
Don't screw with the old lady. <cf>Take good care of the tools of your trade.
You quiet ants over there seem to be fine. <cf>If you're not feeling well, just rest quietly.
I need you guys to stay healthy.
Hey, what the hell, you're being nice all of a sudden. <cf>You're off your rocker.
The next time you have a request, don't be afraid to ask <cf>for a handy adventurer.
Huh!　Is that the reason?
You call yourself a beat performer, right?　I'll keep that in mind. <cf>I'll keep that in mind. I hear they're a bunch of sycophants and meddlers.
I'm not the kind of guy who can take a bigoted old lady's sarcasm and <cf>get the job done right.
Ahhhhh, I can't hear the strange music in my ears. <cf>I'll have to tell everyone in the village well and truly.
...... I wonder if that old lady, for whatever that's worth, <cf>has recognized us.
I think the music of beat performers has <cf>a lot of power.
Adventurers put their bodies on the line every day, don't they? <cf>Some of them get injured or even lose their lives.
Everyone adores adventurers and relies on them, but <cf>it's not all fun and games!
That's why this world needs music!
Even when things are painful, scary, and hard <cf>to light hope in everyone's hearts.
Beat performers don't just fight. <cf>It's a class that has the power to connect people with each other!
There are still those who dismiss it out of hand, but <cf>times are changing. We will change it!
Han!　I'm talking out of my ass. <cf>I need your help, if you don't mind.
Let's make the future of beat performers <cf>shine with our hands!
Speaking of which, what kind of weapons do you use, Anta?
You want to choose the one that comes with your sense of taste and taste!　and <cf>you want to choose the one that comes to your taste and taste.
Our sound depends on our weapons. <cf>We have to have the right chemistry.
Yo, I've been waiting for you!　This request is <cf>I gotta be more enthusiastic than usual!
After all, it was a request for a beat performer!
Sometimes I get <cf>requests specifying an individual or a class or something.
But it's rare to get a request for a beat performer! <cf>Maybe they're getting better and better at what they do.
Oh?　Speak of the devil, it looks like you've got a client.
Hello, here! <cf>My name is Nadris, the person who requested this service.
Kyou, I look forward to working with you today!　Aww!
Hey, nice to meet you! <cf>Why are you looking so nervous?
Well, I, ...... actually, it's my first time to talk to a <cf>beat performer. ......
You know, I actually thought it looked a little scary. ...... <cf>Because the music is so intense and loud.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　I know it's rude to meet you for the first time. <cf>I know you are a fine adventurer!
I can't keep saying I'm not good at this. <cf>Oh, I thought I'd take the plunge and ask for a request!
I see. So you put out a <cf>request for beat performers.
If you're not a good beat performer, you're not a <cf>good beat performer.
Of course, I'd be happy if you like me. <cf>But there are some things that just don't fit, like personal taste.
No, no!　The Priestess also said that we should not judge people by their appearances or assumptions <cf>!
No, it's okay, I'm sure you'll be fine!　My first impression is that both of you are <cf>not that scary!
Haha, that's good to hear! <cf>I'll take care of your request too, don't worry.
Best regards. I need your help with a survey of <cf>plants in "Andra Basin" this time.
There is a goblin habitat there <cf>and it was too dangerous for investigators like us to go alone. ......
First of all, can I ask for an <cf>escort to the Bapharia Order's garrison?
OK. <cf>I'll let you know the details when we get there.
Okay, let's go!　Let's start with the <cf>garrison in "Andra Basin"!
First, escort Nadris to the Andra Basin.
The garrison of the Bapharia cult is just right. <cf>Let's go over there.
They'll give us the details there. <cf>Well, let's get fired up!
Hey, good job! <cf>Looks like you made it here in one piece.
Thank you very much. <cf>I'll begin my investigation then.
As I told you before we left, <cf>there are goblin settlements in the "Andra Basin"!
The plants we want to collect for the study are growing in the vicinity of <cf>and can be found at ......
I guess we'll just have to kick the goblins to the curb.
No, I think it is indeed impossible to defeat them all. <cf>We wanted to get your attention while getting rid of them.
In that sense, I also thought for a moment that the beat performer's <cf>music might be effective!
Oh, I see!　If we make loud noises, <cf>we'll attract goblins.
So Nadris can collect them in the meantime. <cf>That's smart!
Oh, really?　I get embarrassed when I get complimented. <cf>Heh, heh, heh.
I'll try to keep a low profile, so <cf>you two should rather stand out!
Han!　You got it!　When it comes to standing out, no one beats <cf>Beat Performer!
Alright, let's go out with a bang and take down some goblins!　Let's go out with a bang and take down some goblins! <cf>I think we're both aiming for five kills.
Meet us here when you're done. <cf>Come on, let's stir it up!
Let's take down the goblins in Andra Basin. <cf>It looks like we should be able to kill 5 of each other.
We need to get their attention so they don't go to Nadris. <cf>
When it comes to standing out, beat performers are in their element! <cf>Let's go out with a bang and a bang!
Alright!　Goblin defeat, it's done!
Your sound stood out! <cf>That's something the goblins can't ignore.
Han!　I was really into it, too. <cf>I couldn't match that sound.
Thank you both very much!
Thanks to this, we were able to collect the desired plants. <cf>And the goblins didn't notice me at all.
We are glad we asked Beat Performer to help us!
Han!　Did you review the beat performer at <cf>a little?
Yes, I am!　Of course!
I'm a dull and tone deaf <cf>and I'm not good at playing an instrument or anything at all ......
So I thought it would be great to see beat performers <cf>fighting while playing music!
Besides, when I heard the music, I felt safe knowing that the beat performers were <cf>around me.
I was a little afraid of the loud sound, but <cf>found out that it is really a very reliable sound!
That sound is a sign that the beat performers are working <cf>hard for everyone!
Han!　When you say it like that, <cf>I kinda don't feel bad about it, yeah.
Come on, come on!　The job is done. <cf>Go back and report, report!
Ah, yes. <cf>Let's see, the original client was the Order of Bapharia.
So, I have to go to the temple in Asterleeds. <cf>Um, may I ask you to follow me?
Ugh, a Bapharia temple. ......
No, it ain't nothing. It's a client's request. <cf>I'll follow you to the temple or wherever.
That's why. <cf>Let's get Nadris to the temple in Asterleeds.
Looks like Nadris' request has to be reported to the temple in Asterleeds at <cf>
I don't want to get too close to ....... <cf>My client asked me to do it. I don't have a choice.
Let's give Nadris a ride to the Temple.
Well, here we are. <cf>As usual, it's a restless place.
When you're done, let's get the hell out of here. <cf>There are a lot of troublesome people here.
Well, yes. I might want to go home soon too: ......
Oh, but!　Before I go any further, let me thank you both again <cf>properly!
Thank you so much. <cf>And the survey for our purposes went smoothly.
I have become a complete fan of <cf>beat performers with this request!
Han!　That's a nice thing to say! <cf>I've never been called a fan before.
Really?　Then I'm fan #1!
NADRIS!　What are you doing there?
Kya!　Oh, Dad!
You were with an adventurer again, calling it a request. <cf>I always tell you to be selective about who you associate with.
And what's more. You are a beat performer! <cf>With a bunch of crappy people, pathetic.
Don't be a student forever, <cf>and try to do your duty in the temple!
Sorry, sorry ......
Hey, old man! <cf>Don't come out of nowhere and talk so smugly!
Nadris has been taking care of the cult's requests. <cf>I don't think I have anything to complain about!
Hmm, there you go. You open your mouth and you're classless. <cf>Beat performers are like that.
Those frivolous people who just want to be pampered and admired by music <cf>should stay away from my daughter!
The Lord of Bapharia is watching. <cf>At best, don't be a nuisance to others.
No, don't, Dad!
You come quickly too, Nadris! <cf>I will not allow you to go near these people!
What a bunch of crap!　Priests are always talking out of their <cf>asses!
That's why I didn't want to go near this place!
Sorry ....... I just lost my temper. <cf>It's not something that should be directed at you, is it? I'm sorry.
Han, we're getting a little tense, so let's break up for the day.
Thanks for helping me out. <cf>You'll have to come out with me again sometime. Bye.
I think the number of people who understand what a beat performer is <cf>is growing by leaps and bounds!
But the hard-headed ones and such can still complain about <cf>
Ah~~, I'm bothered! <cf>But, nothing will change if I talk back...
Hey, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I've got another request, so let's do it together.
Hmm?　Low tension? <cf>Well, this client is a little ......
It's a request from the Order of Bapharia.
I wasn't asked by name. <cf>I could have just gone through with it.
See, there was Nadris who was with me on a previous commission, right? <cf>You know, the girl who said she wasn't good at being a beat performer?
Even though she's not a good beat performer, <cf>she asked for it and in the end, she understood!
When I think about that, I realize that I shouldn't be so stingy <cf>about not wanting to be a member of the church.
So I dared to take on a request from the Temple.
Hey, what the hell? <cf>I know it ain't a rattle!
But ...... I'm going to embarrass you too <cf>if I stay lame.
And anyway!　That's why I'm asking you! <cf>I'll be at the Asterleeds Temple to hear about your request!
Don't laugh, let's get going!　Come on!
I think it's a very strange thing for me to choose to work for a cult. <cf>
But it's not like you're always saying you're not good at it or you don't like it, <cf>it's just like you're talking crap and it's lame!
Just go to the temple and let's hear what they have to say! <cf>Oh, God, let's just get this over with, this is the kind of request that I'm talking about!
Are you the beat performers involved with Nadris? <cf>You don't mean to say that you were commissioned by the Temple, do you?
I told you!　Don't bother people!
We were just doing what we were asked to do. <cf>We're not bothering you.
I am saying that it is a nuisance just for people like you who disturb the public morals to come to <cf>the temple!
<span size="Big">If you are a fan of the "Kola ......", you will love it! &lt;/&gt;
(Gosh. ......!　No, patience, patience. <cf>Endure, me.)
Well, well, don't say that. <cf>You can let them try it out.
We are registered adventurers with the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>We take our requests seriously, so don't worry!
Well, you won't be fooled by my pretense of auspiciousness! <cf>Most likely, the idea is to get close to my daughter again.
You have been dallying with my daughter under the guise of a request. <cf>That's what makes you untrustworthy!
(Google ......!　...... No, no, no. <cf>If you start a fight here, it'll be the same as it always is.)
I know what you're going to say. <cf>Let me talk about the request. I'll leave after I hear it.
What's up with that stupid outfit? <cf>You're flaunting your flirty clothes!
Beat performers, such as those who have become lax, <cf>could be guilty of this at any time!
<span size="Big">Shut the fuck up, old man! &lt;/&gt;
I want to know what you're asking for! <cf>I didn't come here to listen to a sermon!
You're making too much noise. What are you doing?
Gim, Gim-sama!　Why are you here?
[--] Tramon. How is the duty I ordered you to perform going? <cf>I see you haven't received my report.
...... for giving advice to young people who are not well behaved. <cf>My apologies. I will get right on it.
Nadris will take care of the request. <cf>Go to Larpal and see what he has to say.
A young man with a bad behavior, huh? <cf>Glen, what do you have to say for yourself?
......Han, there's nothing going on. <cf>We're just here on business.
Let's go, buddy. <cf>He said Nadris is in Larpal.
Try not to cause too much trouble, Glen.
Han, I don't know. <cf>You guys are just making a big deal out of it.
Damn it, I just saw his stinking face. <cf>He's the one I had no business with.
It's nothing, don't worry about it. <cf>Let's just get the request done.
I thought Nadris was in Larpal. <cf>Let's get the hell over there and talk to him.
Ah, Glen and the adventurer! <cf>You took care of our request.
Good. I wasn't sure who would be here. <cf>I'm sure the two of you will be fine.
Yeah, nice to meet you again. Nadris.
So what are we supposed to do? <cf>Tell me right away....
......?　Um, yes. I understand.
This time I'm asking for advice from the folks at Larpal. <cf>They are experiencing feeding damage to the exterior walls and fences of their buildings, and
Apparently, some building materials were used that horngoats like to <cf>eat!
So, it was decided to examine the contents of the Horngoat's stomach to identify <cf>any applicable plants.
If we avoid building materials that horngoats prefer, <cf>we should be able to prevent feeding damage!
I need you two to take down about <cf>5 Horngoats for the survey.
I will accompany you to <cf>to collect what the Horngoat ate, because I will be there to collect it.
Our job is not difficult, but <cf>Nadris must be very hard.
I think it would be rather hard to examine the contents of your stomach.
Haha ......, yes. <cf>No one wanted to do it willingly.
But someone has to do it. <cf>I figured if others don't want to do it, I'll do my best.
Your father has a daughter who is ["]old enough! ["]] or <cf>I'm sure you'll get another snide remark from him, but...
Right. ....... I agree. It takes guts to be willing to <cf>do something that people don't want to do.
Oh, that ...... Glen, you are not well. <cf>Perhaps our father is something ......?
No, it ain't Nadris' dad's fault.
I'm talking about my family. <cf>There's a guy in my family that's a pain in the ass.
And he was a priest in Bapharia. <cf>He's a loudmouth, and he talks from a high place. ......
Han!　Stop it, stop it, stop talking like this! <cf>I feel so pathetic saying this.
We were supposed to take out 5 Horngoats, right? <cf>The ones at Divine Haven Hill, right?
All right, this will all be over soon! <cf>Let's get this over with!
Let's take down 5 <cf>Horngoats in "Divine Haven Hill"!
Nadris is going to retrieve the stomach contents. <cf>He wants us to concentrate on taking them out.
It's not much work, but we've got Nadris <cf>to keep us on our toes.
We'll come back here when we're done. <cf>Then let's get started!
Han!　Good work! <cf>You sounded good again!
Thank you very much. <cf>I was also able to collect what the Horngoats ate.
I'm going to go back to Asterleeds now and go over the details with the <cf>Bapharia cult.
Yeah, you're going to report to the temple. <cf>Well, I'll give you a lift.
I hope my dad finds me again and <cf>doesn't yell at me.
I'm sorry. My dad is <cf>too protective of me.
They're worried even if we go out for a minute. <cf>They're also against field trips like this one.
Lately ["]don't listen to frivolous stuff["], <cf>even talking about the music I listen to ......
I understand. I'm in a similar situation.
We've been Bapharia priests for generations, <cf>and we've always been on the conservative side of things.
They didn't accept anything but traditional music, <cf>and they didn't want any beat performers.
With my brother rising to the rank of second priest, <cf>I was the family snub.
Glen, why are you so <cf>particular about beat performers?
Maybe for the same reason as Nadris?
No matter how much they disagree with me, I like it, and I believe <cf>it's the right thing to do.
Beat performers always have the power that only beat performers have <cf>
I want everyone to know that. <cf>Beat performers are not to be underestimated.
...... I agree. What I do is also modest, but <cf>I believe it must be necessary for someone!
I hope your father understands: ......
Han!　Nadris will be fine! <cf>She's doing her best for everyone!
Come on, let's go report the request! <cf>If your dad's here, we'll tell him, too.
Haha, thank you very much. <cf>Well then, let's go back to the temple in Asterleeds.
Now that Nadris' request is done, <cf>let's head back to the temple in Asterleeds.
I have to give them a big "I've done my job!
Well, we're here!　Let's get this over with.
Your father is ......
Good, I guess he's not here. <cf>I, for one, am going to go report the request while I'm at it.
Oh, you must be ....... You must be Nadris. <cf>I seem to recall that the Temple offered you a job.
Ah, Second Priestess! <cf>My father is always at your service!
Geez!　Why are you coming out?
Mr. Glen?　Oh, maybe ...... <cf>Gim is Mr. Glen's brother?
I have heard from Tramon. <cf>Thank you for your hard work in reporting the request. Mr. Nadris.
Your family will be worried if you are late. <cf>For now, go home.
Um, ...... yes. Now if you'll excuse me. <cf>Glen, Mr. Adventurer. See you.
We haven't seen each other for a while, Glen. <cf>Have you been diligent in your duties?
Shut up. You're not bothering my brother.
Dear Adventurer. Glen is in my care. <cf>Is my brother involved in anything nefarious?
I didn't! <cf>What the hell are you doing, probing my friend?
Beat performers are great adventurers! <cf>There's nothing to get mixed up about!
I don't mean to pick on beat performers. <cf>But I must qualify your attitude.
For those, like my family, with strong conservative views, <cf>the new incarnation of the beat performer is unacceptable!
Some, but some within the Order do. <cf>Glen, you are aware of that.
Still, you'll continue to be a <cf>beat performer, won't you?
Yeah, I'm not going to stop no matter what you say! <cf>I'm going to make my brother recognize me, too!
You're still talking like that. <cf>He can't help it.
With such a narrow view of things, <cf>you'll never change the way people look at you!
...... Sorry, I've shown you the shame of my people.
I've done what you asked me to do, and all I can do is thank you. <cf>You can come with me next time if you like.
Because I'm kind of pissed off. I decided to pick the next request from the Order and <cf>make sure it gets done right!
Han!　I can't end this without being told off! <cf>I'm going to silence my brother and everyone around me with my results!
I'll be ready again, just give me a shout! <cf>I'm counting on you!
Han!　I've been waiting for you! <cf>I just got a big request!
The Order of Bapharia has asked me to escort a pilgrim group and <cf>take down a monster.
There's supposed to be a monster near the pilgrim group's route. <cf>I've been told to escort them and take them down if possible.
They can't say for sure what's going to be there, but <cf>you're there, you'll be fine!
It looks like our brother and <cf>Nadris' dad are in the pilgrimage group.
Nadris said he's going with us. <cf>They're going to do some research on plants and stuff along the way.
Actually, it was Nadris who introduced me to the commission.
The Order was looking for adventurers and <cf>recommended us to them.
Maybe it's because of the reputation of <cf>beat performers that we're entrusted with such a big request.
Thanks for all the help you've given me. <cf>I'm looking forward to working with you again!
It's a chance to appeal directly to my brother, Nadris' dad, and the Order <cf>!
Well, we'll meet up with the pilgrims in Larpal first. <cf>Han!　Let's get fired up!
It's a big request from the Bapharia cult. <cf>It's a great chance to showcase the beat performers!
I hear my brother and Nadris' dad are there too. <cf>Let's show them what we've been working for.
First we'll meet up with the pilgrims in Larpal. <cf>Come on, let's get this over with!
Gi, Mr. Gim!　Are you all right!
Gugu ......!
No, it's okay, it's no big deal. <cf>I have to call someone sooner than that. ......
Nadris!　And my brother!　What's wrong with you!
I mean, hey!　Brother! <cf>What's with the injury?
Mr. Glen!　And Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You know, that, mo, monster is ......!
On the way here, a pilgrim group was attacked by "flame horns"!
Gim led the way and <cf>we were able to escape so far ......
My wounds are not serious. <cf>I'm more worried about those who got separated in the raid.
Traymon, in particular, has fled in the opposite direction from the village. <cf>We must head out to search immediately. ......
Nadris' father!
Well, well, actually, ...... yes
All right, I'll go get him. Let's go help him right now.
Wait, Glen!　The Flame Horn is a dangerous monster. <cf>And you hate Tramon.
Same goes for Traymon. Just saying you're a beat performer <cf>makes you look bad ......
<span size="Big">What do you care about that? &lt;/&gt;
Sure I don't like old man Traymon <cf>. But it doesn't matter now!
If you're in trouble, I'm here to help! <cf>I'm an adventurer and a beat performer!
If they don't like it, so be it. <cf>You don't quarrel with them until you get back alive!
Glen......
I'll bring your father back soon. <cf>Just you wait, Nadris.
Ha, yes! <cf>Please take care of your father!
All right, let's go!　Buddy! <cf>Somewhere on "Divine Haven Hill" the old man should be there!
Tramon will be hiding somewhere in "Divine Haven Hill" <cf>
There are "flame horns" and other monsters around. <cf>Please rescue them as soon as possible.
But that little listener Glen is willing to work for someone who <cf>doesn't like him ......
I may have to change my mind.
Hey, old man Tramon! <cf>You're alive!
Hey, what the hell!　I thought help was on the way, but it's you guys!
You think you owe me a favor? <cf>Things don't work out that way!
If you can talk that much, that's enough. <cf>Have you [twisted] your leg?　Let me see.
Don't touch me! <cf>We don't take care of beat performers!
It's not a good thing to be involved with beat performers. <cf>My daughter won't listen to me and neither will Master Gim.
What about my brother?　What the fuck does it matter?
What are you playing at? <cf>You must have been the one who told Master Gim to do this.
Mr. Ghim has occasionally [touchingly] spoken out in defense of adventurers, especially beat performers <cf>
Perhaps that's why the way conservatives look at <cf>beat performers is changing by the day.
The reason I left this request to the beat performers was because <cf>Gim-sama's intentions were at work.
That brother? <cf>I've never heard of him.
You're always lecturing me at <cf>about how I need to change my attitude.
[Forget about my brother for now. <cf>We've got to do something about the old man.
Leave him alone!　I don't appreciate <cf>beat performers when I help them!
If you don't like me, that's fine, but <cf>don't worry about Nadris.
Just because you don't like beat performers <cf>doesn't mean you can't bother your daughter.
Gunnu: ......
Whether the old man likes it or not, or whether he complains or not, I'm taking him back. <cf>Not for us, but because we promised Nadris.
Old man Tramon doesn't seem to be able to walk. <cf>Then, we have to do something about the "flame horns.
If you run into a <cf>"flame horn" while carrying an old man who can't move a muscle, you're in over your head.
All right!　First, we'll take out the "Flame Horns" and make sure they're safe. <cf>We'll take old man Tramon with us after that.
So, old man!　We're going to <cf>to go, so just stay here and be quiet.
...... "Flame Horn" is in "Divine Haven Hill". <cf>If you can do it, do it!
If you guys are really going to take them down, <cf>I'll listen to you a little bit.
Han!　Don't look so serious! <cf>Let's get going!
The Flame Horns have the Divine Haven Hill as their territory. <cf>If you look for it, you will find it.
I am here as I was told. <cf>I'm only here to slow you down.
...... If you guys really took down the Flame Horns, <cf>I'd be willing to listen a little too.
Oh, no. It's the "Flame Horns."
Sorry about that. I didn't think I'd have to deal with such a nasty guy <cf>
Before, I would have made a big deal about it, saying it was <cf>a chance to show off my beat performers.
I'm not in the mood for that right now. <cf>I think we have to fight regardless of that.
It's like my brother, Nadris, and the rest of us <cf>have people who believe in us.
To answer that, <cf>is what a real beat performer is supposed to look like.
All right! <cf>Let's make our sound really resonate!
Let's go, "Flame Horns"!　Prepare yourself!
Han!　I did it!
Now the pilgrims can relax. <cf>And the monsters around them will be a little more docile.
I would have been in trouble if I was on my own. <cf>Thanks for your help!
I'm starting to feel a little more confident <cf>that I can fight even against the "Flame Horn"!
Oops, I shouldn't have been talking. <cf>I was still in the middle of a request!
Let's go back to old man Tramon for now. <cf>We need to get him to Larpal.
Let's go back to old man Tramon. <cf>We can't leave him there alone.
Now if only they would be quiet and listen to me <cf>
Hey, old man! <cf>I've been defeating the "Flame Horns"!
Is your leg okay? <cf>Then let's get the hell out of here and get to Larpal.
I can't believe that beat performers like you <cf>that "Flame Horn" ......
Han!　That was easy, man!
...... is an exaggeration. Because we both fought it.
I thought the <cf>Bapharia teaching was to join hands in times of trouble?
The old man can't walk because he's hurt. <cf>You can count on us now.
......Yes, let's do that. <cf>I guess I'm the one who doesn't understand God's teachings.
Take me to Larpal. <cf>I must report to Master Gim and Nadris that you are safe.
Best regards to you two adventurers.
Han!　No problem. I'll take care of it.
Come on, let's get back to Larpal! <cf>Well, I feel refreshed and ready to go home!
Let's take old man Treymon to Larpal.
Now that we've defeated the "Flame Horn," we can go home refreshed!
I will have a good report for my brother and Nadris. <cf>Han!　I feel great, man!
Dear adventurer, Glen!　You're safe!
Dad, thank goodness. ......　We were worried about you.
We are sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Gim. <cf>Thank you for protecting my daughter.
I was also able to return with the help of two beat performers <cf>
God Bless Bapharia and thank you <cf>for all your hard work!
Oh, yeah. That was a disaster.
There is also the matter of your injury. <cf>You and Mr. Nadris should rest for the time being.
Let's go, Dad.
Nadris. I once held a musical instrument in my hand. <cf>I longed to be a musician at the Star Festival.
There were times when I neglected my duties all day <cf>and spent all my time practicing music.
What?　Oh, your father!
But I lacked the talent, the will to carry [myself] through, <cf>and the desire to play for someone else.
I guess I was directing my selfish jealousy at you and the beat performers <cf>
It woke me up. <cf>I think music has great power.
The music played by the ...... beat performers will push people to <cf>
You and I both need to learn from them. <cf>Let's have a little chat over there.
Uh-huh.
Um, so we'll be here. <cf>Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll excuse us.
I've never heard Traymon talk like that before. <cf>Maybe he had some kind of change of heart.
Glen. And you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>You did a great job, including defeating the "Flame Horns.
Especially, Glen. You were no longer the <cf>little brother I imagined you to be.
Han, you're the one. <cf>You weren't a hard-nosed know-it-all, were you?
You've been defending beat performers for all kinds of reasons. <cf>It's so watery that you didn't say anything.
From now on, you're going to have to stand tall and be an ally. <cf>I know you're a ...... brother.
I never thought I'd hear those words from your mouth one day.
Dear Adventurer. I would like to thank you again. <cf>Thank you for supporting my brother.
Thanks to you, people will look at beat performers <cf>in a different light!
Han!　Totally, man! <cf>You've shown us what a beat performer can do.
You're a great guy! <cf>I couldn't be happier to have you as a friend.
We look forward to working with you in the future! <cf>Let's make our sound echo around the world!
Yo!　Are you sounding good today?
I'm trying out different requests too. <cf>Han!　It's fun and worthwhile!
I get the occasional request from my brother, Nadris, and old man Traymon at <cf>.
Let's do it again when we get a chance! <cf>I'm looking forward to the session with you!
Hey, buddy. <cf>Can you do me a favor?
It's a simple job. <cf>I just need you to run out there and deliver the package.
...... is that <span size="Big">a bad product&lt;/&gt;?
Kukuk ...... yeah, that's a pretty <span size="Big">bad product&lt;/&gt;!
Once you get a taste of this guy, there's no going back: ......
……！？
It's Salamzart's specialty, a super spicy spice! <cf>Just a whiff of it will fuck your nose up, you know?
I thought <span size="Big">was a thing.
Well, well, well. <span size="Big">We'll have to do the "thing" another time.
……！？！？
There's a lady who recently moved here from Salamzart <cf>and she said this spice is hard to find over here.
But fortunately, my supplier carries them. <cf>They just got it in.
I'd like to get them to you as soon as possible, because freshness is vital. ...... <cf>I've got to prepare some food too!
I'll give you free lodging if you deliver it to me. <cf>please do me a favor, thanks.
Oh?　You wanted to see me?
The owner of the coin-operated pavilion asked me to deliver this to you. <cf>He asked me to deliver this to you.
Oh ...... this!　I've always wanted this spice. <cf>Now I can recreate the taste of my hometown. I'm so glad!
I hear that's pretty spicy. ......
Is that so? <cf>Is that normal in Salamzart?
...... yes, it is!　Come eat it sometime if you'd like. <cf>I'll treat you for delivering it to me.
Wow, really?　Thank you!
But still, you are indeed Asterleeds. <cf>You can get what you want, after all.
I've never seen a subhuman of your type before. <cf>Where are you from?
A......
Uh ...... not Asterleeds, I guess ......
Oh, we have to go back to the coin-operated pavilion. <cf>Well then, please treat us when you get a chance!
Huh?　Yes, I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. <cf>And when you do, bring your husband with you.
Oh, you delivered it. Good job.
The client lady is going to treat us to a dish with those spices <cf>next time we are there.
["]At that time, her husband was with her ["]and she said <cf> but ......
You guys go on your own. <cf>I'm feeling just fine, yeah.
......?　What's up, Feste? <cf>You look kind of delicate.
Really?　Well, ...... I'm going to take a little rest upstairs. <cf>Don't wake me up.
...... What the hell is that guy? What's up with that guy?
Even that thing is your master, isn't it? <cf>Go check on him.
I told you not to wake him up.
You were acting strange, so I was worried.
...... hey, just remembering...
The lady told you that she had never seen a subhuman like me before. <cf>She said she'd never seen a subhuman like me before.
It's been a long time since I've been here. <cf>I've been told that less and less. ......
...... eagles have never seen the same species as themselves.
I have met many subhumans. <cf>But none of them looked like me.
I have no memory of ...... the past, and no kindred spirits. <cf>I'm just remembering that one a bit.
Well, as long as I have enough money to live on, <cf>I don't really care!　Right?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, my servant indeed. You know what you're doing!
But I ...... <cf>want to get your memory back too.
But I also want ...... <cf>to get your memory back too!
[--]!
What's the matter? Don't look so strangely serious. <cf>You're embarrassing me!
Now, go on. Your husband told you to <cf>go check on him, didn't he?
After a short rest, I'm going downstairs too. <cf>I'm hungry!
Oh, how was Feste?
Right: ......
She says things like, ["]A good woman doesn't need the past! ["]] or <cf>, but she's got a lonely look in her eyes from time to time.
I think it was about ......4 years ago. <cf>Feste was lying outside of town, hungry.
I had no memory of it, and it looked like a wreck. ...... <cf>So I kind of picked it up.
Back then I was fooled too. <cf>I kindly fed him and offered him a place to stay. ......
And then, I was totally at home. <cf>They bring in all kinds of trouble and hassle without hesitation.
I'm going to have to make sure I get paid <cf>for four years of lodging and inconvenience!
...... Well, it's better that they're excited about making money <cf>than that they're dreary, right?
Feste, and I hope you get your memory back soon too.
Hey, give me something to eat! <cf>I'm starving after a little rest!
Ah, the noisy one has come down. <cf>No choice, I'll make it on the tab!
meow
Oh, you are his ....... <cf>I didn't expect to see you here. Hmm?
Meow?　Meow!
No...... that's what you mean......
Servant, I know it's sudden, but I have to work now. <cf>I won't take no for an answer, will I?
Well, let's see if we can get ...... <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>some meat from <cf>about 10 of them.
What?　Why?
I will obey the Lord's command without a murmur! <cf>That is what it means to be a servant!
Is it good?　When you get what you want, give it to this cat at <cf>. Then it will be delivered to him.
Nah!
Well, then, take this to him. <cf>No need to thank me.
It is the Lord's duty to provide for his servants!
What the--?
...... hmm?　What is it? <cf>What's that on my face?
Now, a servant is ......
Kukuku...... thought you and Tyris were the only servants? <cf>Sweet!　Very sweet indeed!
What do you know about me?
She is an eternal, super beautiful girl.
What, what, you know what I'm talking about. <cf>Hehe...... hehe....... I'm embarrassed. ......
Well, well, I have many servants besides you <cf>. I have a lot of servants to obey, don't I?
Hmm?　What, are you jealous? <cf>You want me all to yourself?　Hmmm~?
used when giving a reason not to answer, e.g. "What's wrong with you?
Oh, no. It's fresh meat. <cf>I'll have to get it to my servant as soon as possible.
I'll go with you. It's been a long time since I've seen his face.
Don't worry, I'll be back soon. <cf>So don't look so sad. Hmmm...
It's hard to be a popular Lord~♪
Meow, meow!
Long time no see, servant #5. <cf>Is this child of ...... yours?
2~......
Heh, he's a fine husband to come begging for food on behalf of his wife <cf>
I'm not!
Go ahead, eat your fill. <cf>For the sake of your children's milk.
Meow!
Now, will you listen to me? <cf>I have a new servant.
They are both so dangerous. <cf>And they're lonely, so we have to get them back soon.
Meow!
Don't worry. I will take good care of you and your family. <cf>I am the master.
This is ...... servant #8, isn't it? He will grow up big, won't he?
Meow~!
I'm sure you'll be able to find me at ....... <cf>They'll all have to do without me.
Well, I better get back. <cf>Before the servant I left behind cries out in loneliness.
You too can always count on me. <cf>It is the Lord's role to protect his servants!
Hey, you two!　 <cf>You were in the right place at the right time!
What's that, out of nowhere?
Actually, I have a favor to ask you [--].
Not here, so let's change the location. <cf>Yes, ...... you can wait for me on the top floor of this building.
[You're a real pain in the ass, aren't you? <cf>Well, ......, I'll do you the favor.
Thanks for the wait!
Wait a minute. <cf>So, what's the favor?
I'm sorry, but I need you to go to Minsterhorn. <cf>I need you to give this letter to the priest there.
What? <cf>Why don't you go yourself?
I wish I could. <cf>But I'm busy gathering info on avaritia right now.
We can't just leave what could be a crisis in Asterleeds <cf>, can we?
[--]So, please. <cf>You're the only one I've got to do this!
Okay, okay.
Thank you! You can tell the priests at <cf>that "Jake sent me."
...... Yeah, I'm sure you'll be fine. <cf>Don't read the letter, okay?
Okay?　I'm only asking because it's you. <cf>Don't ever look inside, okay?　Really, don't look, okay?
You are persistent. <cf>Don't worry, I'm with you!
No, it's more like <cf>I'm worried because your daughter is with you ......
All right, servant. <cf>I will read the letter aloud to you right here and now... ♪
Stop, I trust you! <cf>You and your daughter are both trustworthy people!
Hmm, well, fine. <cf>In exchange, I'm going to play the reward, okay?
Yes, of course. <cf>I'll pay you what you want!
All right, all right. That's top of the line. <cf>I'm counting on you.
But a priest in Minsterhorn? <cf>I never thought I'd go back to see a guy who talks like that. ......
Oh, you guys are at ....... What's going on? <cf>Did you come here to ask about [the visitor] again?
That's fine. Let's talk as much as you want. <cf>Last time, we even talked about the "Pillar of Divinity," as I recall.
Now, let me tell you about the origin of this [mihashira]. <cf>To begin with, I would like to talk about who made that thing [--].
Mamma, wait!　Not this time! <cf>We are here on Jake's errand!
What?　Jake's? <cf>It's ......, I see.
I had assumed that you had also found <cf>interest in this journey of exploration called history and ...... had ......
Sorry about that. Anyway, this time Jake asked me to do something for him. <cf>He asked me to give you this letter.
Hmmm. It is indeed addressed to me. Oh, this is ......
What is it?　What does it say? <cf>Can't you at least tell me a little bit?
Hmmm, yes, ....... <cf>Maybe you should have them listen to it.
&lt;Whenever I see the rain falling in Asterleeds, I think of you <cf>
&lt;Whether they are tears of sorrow or tears of joy. <cf>I hope both of them are for me.
...... it's ......
What do you think?
What do you think, <span size="Big">It's totally a love letter&lt;/&gt; ......!
What?　That?　Jake?　For you? <cf>Wait, wait, wait, wait!　You're sure it's not a mistake?
There is no mistake. Jake and I have exchanged many of these statements <cf>
Huh?　What? <cf>Wait a minute, I'm a little confused.
Let's see, does that mean that you and Jake are <cf>in love letters to each other ......?
How many times?
many times
...... Mm, I understand. I understand. <cf>That's one of those things, yes!
Well, my servants. Now that the letter has been safely handed over, <cf>we shall return to report.
But Jake thought Myulie was the one <cf>for him, but you never know the ...... heart of a man.
Oh, please wait. <cf>I'm afraid I'm going to have to write a reply to Jake.
Sarara ~ ...... Yes, it's done. <cf>Now, please give this to Jake.
Next time you come, let's talk about [the mihashira]. <cf>No, now would be better. To begin with, what is a mihashira?
Well, that's it for us. <cf>Love letters are better when they are fresh!
Oh, your tone sounds like Jake, doesn't it? <cf>Are you close to ......?
Not at all!　Not at all!　 <span size="Big">Not a bit of this! &lt;/&gt;
So <span size="Big">don't be jealous&lt;/&gt;!
Ha-ha-ha, jealousy. <cf>I don't have any such feelings.
I guess they don't give a rat's ass about us. ...... <cf>You and Jake seem to have a very good relationship.
I wonder what it is about ....... Before I knew it <cf>I felt like a relative's child had grown up. ......
Come on, let's get this letter to Jake. <cf>Let's make sure they have a bright future together!
Sorry to keep you waiting! <cf>Did you give me the letter!
Ah, here's the reply from the priest. <cf>Here is the priest's reply. Read it with all your heart.
Yeah! I knew you guys would do it. <cf>That priest was a long story, wasn't he?
You ...... are such a dearly missed <cf>you don't say it like that, do you?
......?　Well, at least I'll have to give you your reward.
Oops, I shouldn't have done that. I left it in the warehouse. <cf>Sorry ....... Wait here.
Wasn't Jake here just now? <cf>It's so unusual for him to come to a place like this.
[Why are you here?
It's time for a break. <cf>I love the view from here.
Well ....... <cf>Oh, by the way, good for you.
......?　What?
Jake. He's got a girlfriend.
Eh ......
You once told <cf>that you were having trouble saying no, right?　Well, this should solve that problem.
...... Right. Yeah, good.
Hey, sorry!　Sorry to keep you waiting!
Oh, I see Jake is back. <cf>Well, I'll take this then.
I just passed Myulie. <cf>What's going on?
He said he likes the view from here.
Wow! You are a romantic after all!
...... and here's your reward. <cf>Don't say it's not enough, okay?
It's a bit dull. ...... <cf>Oh well, I got to meet your girlfriend.
Sweetheart?　Oh, come on, you're getting ahead of yourself. <cf>Well, I'm pretty sure it's going to be her.
With this love letter, she will find me attractive. <cf>It was worth it!
Taught ......?
Oh!　I asked that priest to correct my Love Letter at <cf>and today I finally got a passing grade.
Now that's Get her heart ze!
Ah ...... ah, that kind of ....... Wow. ......
Now, it's time to write the letter. <cf>I will put my heart and soul into this letter!
Mm, good luck. Good luck to you.
...... Don't say anything, servant. <cf>We didn't say anything to her. Okay?
<span size="Big">Two-timing and bullshit, you idiot! &lt;/&gt;
Wait! Just a moment! <cf>Why?　I'm sure I passed ......
Unqualified red rejection, enemy of women!
Hey, hey, wait ...... ggghhh!
Fu ......
Hmm? <cf>...... What are you guys doing here?
Wherever you are, you're on your own.
What's with your difficult face? <cf>Did you fail at cooking?
Such things happen every day.
No, you can't reopen that.
...... these guys can handle it.
Let me make a request. <cf>I want you to give this to the adventurers in Larpal.
Originally, I was going to ask someone else to do it. <cf>Apparently, he couldn't come.
The letter ......?　Is that <span size="Big">a bad product&lt;/&gt;?
...... Yeah, it's a pretty <span size="Big">bad product&lt;/&gt;.
Once you know what's in this guy, there's no turning back. <cf>That's the kind of guy he is.
What's this? It's different and more powerful than usual.
Yeah, ...... might put you in some danger. <cf>Would you still take it on?
I'll take care of it.
Well, I'm sorry. <cf>I'll make sure I thank you properly.
Say 'from the other side of the coin' to the person you give it to. <cf>That should get it through.
Oh, ......, what's with the secrecy?
Please do not ask any questions. <cf>I'll tell you the details once I've successfully accomplished your request.
Hmmm......... Well, if you're going to thank me, good. <cf>Besides, you and I are on good terms.
Sorry. <cf>Oh, and just so you know, don't read the letter, okay?
Well, it's been wax sealed, so there's no way I'm going to tell you to look at <cf>
Don't underestimate us. <cf>It is the pride of an adventurer to leave the commissioned goods untouched.
When you're done, come to the dock at the port. <cf>We'll talk there.
A pier? <cf>Why such a place ......
Prying is [--].
Useless, right? <cf>...... understands.
Well then, my servant. I know it's a bit of a hassle, but let's get going. <cf>I will go to the house to collect a large sum of money from my husband!
Excuse me, does your brother know the owner of the coin-operated pavilion at <cf>?
...... anything?
Deliveries of "From the Other Side of the Coin. "Â
[--]!
I see. So you are the understudies. I understand. <cf>I was in a bit of a bind because my liaison couldn't make it.
Then why not just go get it in person?
Unfortunately, there are reasons why that is not possible. <cf>Well, there are a number of circumstances.
Tell your husband, 'The food has become bad. I miss my husband's taste.' Tell him <cf>. I'm asking you.
...... But the husband trusts <cf>such a bumpy duo. ......
Did I just say something?
Oops, no, my bad. Well, I will now go to ......
All right, all that's left to do is to pass the message on to your husband.
But, my husband. You're scaring me for nothing. ...... <cf>There's nothing dangerous about it.
Who are you?
Gosh ......!
[--]!　That's the voice of the adventurer who just came in! <cf>Let's go!　Hurry up, servant!
You guys are here!　No, but ...... no. <cf>Get away from here as fast as you can. ...... Ouch!
You are wounded! <cf>Did someone do this to you!
Yeah, ...... you guys have pulled it off thanks to your visit, but <cf>still lurking around the perimeter.
That's probably ......
If you don't want to die, obey honestly. <cf>Otherwise, you'll end up like my friend.
[--]!　Where are you?　Where are you?
(Oh yeah, this guy makes the connection: ......!)
You little missy there and your adventurers, <cf>if you don't want to get involved, you'd better leave like adults.
I'm not so outrageous as to kill innocent people.
(...... guy doesn't seem to know <cf>that you guys brought the letter. This is convenient)
(You guys run. I'll take care of this.) I'll take care of this.)
With that injury, it's impossible!
I'll take care of it here.
I'll take care of it here.
But see ......!
Don't worry. My servant is a little stronger than you think.
Sorry ....... I'm indebted to you!
All right, let's go!　Servant!
All right!　We got him down!
You guys are awesome ......
Hmph! <cf>In the hands of a servant, people of that caliber are ......
......, you can never be too careful. <cf>There may be more of them out there, so let's get out of here!
You guys have been a big help. <cf>Thank you so much.
Now do you see why your husband trusts us?
Oh, I take my hat off to you. You are much more skilled than I am. <cf>And you've got a tight-lipped ......, don't you?
...... That being said, I can't even ask you why you were targeted <cf>and what that letter was about!
Haha, I guess I can trust you to know things too.
...... Okay, that's enough of an allowance. <cf>We should be leaving soon.
Are you okay?　Are they going to attack you again?
We were caught off guard earlier, but ...... and <cf>already know the enemy's hand. We won't be delayed again.
Okay. Okay.
You are strong. You might have a good match <cf>with the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt, who pride themselves on their bravery.
Please use that power for what is right.
Well, I'll take this one this time. <cf>Please take care of the message to your husband.
Mm, leave it to me.
...... Speaking of which, you have a much different tone than you did the first time <cf>It's [--]
Well then, adventurer brother. Be careful!
...... I'm a reasonably good judge of things, so <cf>I'll pretend I didn't ask. Well then.
The husband is at ......
Oh, looks like you made it back in one piece.
The rice tastes bad now. I miss my husband's taste.
Is that your message? <cf>I see ...... you're having a hard time.
Well, at any rate, thank you, thank you!
And you ...... ["]I'll tell you the details if you successfully accomplish the request["] <cf>I think you said?
Ahh ...... was that right? <cf>Then which would you prefer, a thank you or a reason?
What the hell is that?　That's not fair!
Just kidding, just kidding. I'll pay you and give you the details.
Well, you know what? I've been doing a lot of <cf>deals to run this place, too, you know?
That was a letter that I didn't want my business partners to know about. <cf>If they get ahead of us, we'll be in trouble.
...... Is that something that would cause human deaths?
...... Well, that's what it's all about. <cf>I feel bad for the guy who connected them.
Remember, this world can't be crossed <cf>with just pretty words.
Come on, let's pay the courtesy. <cf>And I'll collect the money as repayment of the debt.
Huh!　What is that? <cf>You bastard!
Ha ha ha!　I told you, didn't I? <cf>You can't get across just by being pretty.
Well, go back to your coin-operated pavilion and eat your food. <cf>Consider it a wage, if you will.
Muki [ooooo]!　I'm sorry! <cf>But I'll take my rice!
......The world is a lot dirtier than you think.
Hmm?　What did you say?
Don't eat dirty, I said. <cf>Come on, let's go home.
<span size="Big">Dang!　That thing is ......! &lt;/&gt;
Mm?　What's wrong?
Such is the case with ....... No way, here's ......!
What's wrong? Did something bad happen!
Sorry ....... I will take a moment of your time. <cf>I have some information I need to ask from the boy.
Then we'll join you [--].
No, <span size="Big">I'm enough here on my own&lt;/&gt;.
Seniors are asked to gather information on Avaritia.
What is wrong with Tyris? <cf>She looked kind of serious. ......
I don't know. I've never seen Tyris' face like that before. <cf>
Such ...... impatient and determined faces are ......
By the way, do you recognize that boy that Tyris is talking about <cf>?
No, I'm not at all ......
Mm, yeah. ......
It can't be helped. Let's wait until Tyris comes back. <cf>We have to ask her what that boy is, or we won't be able to clear our heads.
Thank you for your patience. <cf>I apologize for my selfish behavior.
That's fine. <cf>But can you tell us what you went to ask?
It can be found at ......
Sorry ...... Confidential.
Why don't you tell me about it?
I am sorry, Mr. Aerinse. <cf>But it's not about avaritia.
Just ......
Just?　What is it?
Its ....... <cf>..................
What is it? Don't say it out loud...
I know this is a thick ask, but could you please find what I'm talking about at <cf>without asking me anything?
I want to get the <cf>back combined unit "[Shouten Wings]" for "Hero King Athenion Hyper Gold Armor"!
<span size="Big">What? What? &lt;/&gt;
That's a very ostentatiously named piece of equipment. ...... <cf>That boy, if he is the reincarnation of a hero!
How is that possible? <cf>It's just the name of a boy's toy.
But why do you want <cf>such a thing?
Please forgive me ...... for that. <cf>It is just something I really need ......!
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, okay.
Wait, wait, wait!　Don't make up your mind! <cf>That thing is not so easy to get!
It was not for sale a long time ago. It's at a premium, and <cf>it's hard to find one even if someone wants one.
If you look for something you're not looking for, you'll end up with a fake.
You know your stuff, Mr. Feste. <cf>But what then?
For toys from this era, if you have similar components <cf>I think I can machine and finish it for you!
I know how to handle equipment such as Omnistron. <cf>But I don't know the shape or detailed mechanism. ......
Hmmm. If it is "Shoutenyou", the key is to reproduce that shine. <cf>I wish I could get some shiny material. ......
I believe there was a <cf>guy on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>who had a habit of collecting shiny things ......
They are from the "Soundless Foothills" of Bahamar Highland. <cf>We can borrow a little from them.
All right!　Servants. It's your turn. <cf>Show them that you can be counted on as a senior.
Nice to meet you, senpai!
I see that you have collected the parts. <cf>Thank you, seniors!
Now, let's get started with the processing. <cf>Could you tell us about the structure of "Shouten Wings"?
Very well. First, we need a beautiful wing symbol. <cf>The image of an atenion galloping majestically in the sky.
[--]This one here and this one here are moving. This one is gold and it's ....... <cf>Oh, no. That's not the case there. ......
It's done. ......　 <span size="Big">It's done! &lt;/&gt;
This is "[Shouten Wings (Shouten Yoku)]" ......! <cf>Ah, finally in my hands: ......
Well, well, well. <cf>There, are you satisfied now?
Thank you very much! <cf>I will deliver it to that boy immediately!
...... hmm? <cf>You didn't want it, did you?
No, me especially. I can't stay like this, ......! <cf>I must hurry and get to the boy!
What is it? What is it? <cf>Anyway, we're going to try it.
Wow!　Amazing! <cf>It really is "[Shoutenyou]"!
Are you sure you want to trade?　For this doll? <cf>I don't want to be asked to give it back later, right?
Like I said before, it's a cheap toy that my grandma <cf>bought by mistake.
That's fine. <cf>In fact, that's fine.
Well, I don't need a doll for a girl. <cf>I was just wondering if I should throw them away.
Then we'll trade as promised. <cf>Yay!　I've always wanted one of these!
Tyris, that doll is ......
I found ......
Mm?
<span size="Big">Yay!!! &lt;/&gt;
<span size="Big">It's a limited edition of the Gilbert family! &lt;/&gt;
Yay!
This is a super-premium doll for enthusiasts to drool over!　I would have thought ...... <cf>in this day and age, but I never thought I would get it as soon as it came!
Wow~ I'm so happy [~~]!　Cute [~~]! <cf>Definitely cuter than what I had seen in the data [～～～～]!
Description. The Gilbert Family is a series of dolls for girls that are <cf>deformed monsters
Well, I see! <cf>That's what I'm talking about, Mr. Feste, a very clear explanation.
What is ...... trying to explain to me? <cf>Holy cow, there's a lot of excitement going on there, Tyris!
You, you can't change the past! <cf>There is a possibility that history will be changed because of that doll [--].
No, it's not. It's okay. The simulation is perfect. <cf>I have done all the calculations for this day. It's flawless.
Oh, no. <cf>This is a face I have no intention of letting go of.
Oh well. Tyris volunteered <cf>for such a dangerous journey, so please allow me at least a reward!
Okay, now ......
Well, let's brace ourselves and get rid of avaritia!
I will have to find a dollhouse that will fit this doll. <cf>I'm sure that in this day and age, that thing would be ...... fufufu ......
It seems the ...... mania has turned on. <cf>You'd better be prepared for this in the future. ......
..........and, my servant. Wait a minute.
Those two ...... have something interesting to talk about, don't they?
How are you feeling? <cf>You look very tired. ......
Thanks. But I'm fine. <cf>I'm sorry for worrying you.
You may say so, but it sounds like a strong statement.
It may be due to the chronoleaps, but <cf>I still think the environment is bad too!
This dirt and dusty place <cf>is no place for Mr. Aerinse!
Sure, I've never been to a place like this before, but ...... <cf>I'm prepared for that, too, because I've come to this time in my life.
Speaking of the [--]era, I've been <cf>a little concerned about something.
Yes, sir?　Anything you want.
Doesn't this outfit ...... look a little different from those around you?
Huh?
Not so much for Tyris yet. <cf>Is my clothing inappropriate for the environment or ......?
It is ....... But I've prepared a proper database at <cf>to look up the clothing of this era.
Perhaps if you go to a more crowded place <cf>you'll see more people dressed that way ......
I hope so. ......
I'd like to ...... since I'm going to be there, I'd like to <cf>look like Tyris, which is easy to move around in.
No, no!　Aerinse, you, the Lord Aerinse, <cf>should not be dressed as such a commoner!
But ......
Even if you put on such a face, what is not good enough is not good enough!
Tyris's tease: ......
U......! <cf>And anyway, please rest now!　Voila!
It wasn't interesting at all. ...... <cf>It was just a lover's quarrel between the lady and her sidekick. ......
Well, it is true, however, that Aerinse is having quite a hard time <cf>in an environment she is not accustomed to.
How about it?　How about I offer you something invigorating <cf>?
Yeah, let's do that.
Yes, we do. Let's do that.
Hmmm. I'm sure they'll be so impressed with our kindness that they'll give us <cf>a substantial honorarium!
After all, she seems to be quite a young lady. ...... <cf> Just kidding about the [--].
Tyris is also my servant. <cf>As a senior, you can't just leave him there.
Okay, so let's get right to it [--], <cf>What's the most energizing food around here?
Let's ask the merchants around there first.
Hey, merchant! <cf>Do you know of any food around here that would cheer me up?
Foods that would cheer you up? <cf>Hmmm, yes. ......
If you want a drink, how about "Jug-Ade"? <cf>It's a very nutritious drink.
I'm unfortunately out of it right now, but <cf>is a great way to regain your strength.
If you pick me up some "Jag nuts" for the ingredients <cf>I'll give you a cup of service!
I see. ....... <cf>Thanks, merchant!
You heard it too, right? <cf>Now let's get the "Jug Fruits"!
Merchant! <cf>I picked "Jaguar Fruits"!
Wow!　That's some fine fruit you got there.
Oh, you promised to serve "Jug-Ade". <cf>I'll be right back to make it!
Hoi!　It's done!
Yay!　Thank you! <cf>I'll drink it with care!
Oh!　Drink it while it's fresh!
Okay, let's get this to Aerinse.
I hope this offering makes Aerinse feel a little better <cf>
...... Hmm?　What are you two talking about again?
......It is with sincere regret that I offer this <cf>
If you are having a hard time, you can go back to <cf>the original time period.
Even though this was the only way, it seems that Mr. Aerinse has been burdened more than <cf>expected, and[--]
...... It's true that it's a little painful, but <cf>if you're weak like this, you won't be able to save the stars!
Hey, Tyris. <cf>You would know, wouldn't you?
I have never been outside before.
So I'm really happy to be here at <cf>, albeit in this way!
Really, it's such a ....... <cf>Such a beautiful sky. ......
When Bachelard taught me, I couldn't imagine ......
...... Oh, it's true. <cf>It is indeed ...... very beautiful ......
This sky continues to our time, <cf>and even further into the future!
I feel again now <cf>that my mission is to try to make this beautiful world last forever ......
So, while I appreciate your concern very much, <cf>I cannot accept the suggestion that we just leave.
...... understand. <cf>If that is the wish of Mr. Aerinse.
This Tyris, I swear I will help you <cf>even if it costs me my life!
No. Your life is your first priority.
However [--].
If you die before I do, <cf>I'll be right behind you, won't I?
U......!
Totally ....... <cf>Shut up and listen, or you'll have another lover's quarrel.
Ha!　Chi, molestation ......! <cf>No, sir!　I mean, why are you asking!
I heard you, so I don't blame you. <cf>Be that as it may, here, let's do this.
Is this ......?
I prepared it with my own. I heard it makes you feel better when you drink it. <cf>I thought you might like to check out ...... for Aerinse.
Well, thank you very much!
......Well, what the heck. We've come all the way to this age. <cf>I think you should have a little fun without getting all uptight.
If you keep stuffing yourself full of sincerity, you'll run out of breath. <cf>Isn't that right?
Although it was a natural progression, I and my servant joined the group. <cf>It is no longer just the two of you on this journey.
Thank you ....... <cf>It is one more thing I am glad to have come to this time!
I'm glad I have more servants. <cf>Here, Tyris. Give Aerinse a drink.
Gosh ......!　I'm still not used to being treated like a servant, but <cf>I appreciate the offer!
うむ、礼は相場の値で良いぞ♪
Ha!　You're going to take money!
Oh my, how much is it? <cf>I wonder if this jewelry will be enough ......
You don't have to pay, Mr. Aerinse! <cf>I mean, that's clearly too much to pay!
You there, you're an adventurer, right? <cf>I have a job for you. Take it.
Sorry, all requests for this one go through me at <cf>[--].
What the hell?　You subhuman brat, you're so cocky. <cf>Oh well, let's talk business.
...... So?　What is your job?
Mm. There is a priestess of the <cf>oracle of the Order of Bapharia in this village right now, right?
I am looking for an item to donate to that priestess.
Are you a contributor ......? You are deeply religious.
Oh, I believe in oracle priestesses, my friend!
After all, the words of an oracle priestess are priceless. If you can show me <cf>the way forward, I will be more successful than I am now!
To be gifted with that word, we must contribute something more expensive, <cf>rare and beautiful than the others!
Yes ...... we need to deliver something more valuable than others and <cf>enough items to catch the attention of the priestess!
That's why you guys should go pick up a "Rose Sapphire" <cf>. Right now.
...... I see. So what's the reward?
I'm giving the others a job to do. <cf>So, to the one who brings the best [--].
Screw you.
Huh ......?　Now what?
<span size="Big">I said, "Don't be silly!
I refuse such a request, <span size="Big">, you idiot! &lt;/&gt;
What ......!　You, you ......
If you listen patiently for the money, <cf>well, you'll hear a lot of blabbering from the top!
Let's go, servant. <cf>It's a waste of time to waste your time on this boorish nuisance.
Ki, you insulted me! <cf>You poor habit!　You're a poor man's habit!
You may have money, but you don't seem to have the vocabulary to abuse it~?
Gugu ...... gugu ......!!!! <cf>You and others will be poor for the rest of your lives!　Suck it up!
I feel bad for him. <cf>Even we have the right to choose our requests.
Good?　Even if you want money, <cf>you don't want to deal with a grown-up like that [--]hmm?
...... What's that?　That girl. <cf>She keeps looking at me.
...... You are looking at me with great enthusiasm. <cf>Come, my servant, let's go and have a little chat.
Hey, you've been looking at us for a while now. <cf>What do you want?
I'd like to make a request to ......, too.
...... In case you'd like to talk to us?
Let's talk about your request. <cf>Then we'll see if we accept.
Yes, I am interested in flowers!　Um, ...... I need flowers. <cf>Flowers to make flower crowns.
I would like to give it to the oracle priestess.
You too want a word from a priestess?
Oh no!　I am afraid! <cf>I only wanted to cheer up the priestess.
I have a longing to become a priestess. <cf>If it were possible, I would like to serve by your side someday.
I just thought it would be nice if the shrine maidens who are on a hard pilgrimage now could be healed a little by <cf>flower crowns. ......
But the flowers from the village were not enough <cf>to make the crown as beautiful as I wanted it to be ......
My mom says ["]don't go outside the village <cf>because of the fear of monsters["]......
So that's how they found us.
A rather lovely wish, but what about you?
Sure, I'll take it on.
Sure, I'll take care of it.
Are you sure?　Thank you!
Oh, I'm more than willing to take on this rich guy. <cf>So, how many flowers do you need?
I'd like to have three ...... uh ...... <cf>because I want them for prominent decoration!
I see. Three beautiful flowers. <cf>Wait a minute. I'll look around here.
If that's the flower, <cf>it should be in the high ground in this vicinity.
Here, I picked you some flowers. Is this okay?
Thank you!　Wow, beautiful ......!
Let's see ...... insert this here ...... like this ......
[--] It's done!　What do you think?
Oh!　Looks like it would suit an oracle priestess.
Ehehe ...... miko, I hope you're pleased.
I'm sure they will be pleased. Let's go deliver it right away. <cf>Let us see it through.
Yes!
Hmm?　Looks like you've got a prior engagement. ...... that's ......
What do you think?　Isn't it a fine piece of art? <cf>I'll donate it to you.
Instead, I'll let the oracle's priestess take care of you. ......
...... Let me ask you one question. <cf>Did you get this by your own strength?
Huh?　Oh, yes. <cf>It's the one and only thing I paid for!
...... I see
Donations will be gratefully received. <cf>May the God of Bapharia bless you.
Mm, then to the priestess [--].
The oracle priestess is a busy woman. <cf>No one will be able to see you now. Please leave us.
Huh?　What are you talking about? <cf>I donated all this wonderful stuff, remember?
Pick up.
You know, I [--]
If necessary, we will return the donated goods.
The priestesses will only speak to those who are truly faithful <cf>
[--]Please take it back.
......!　Hmmm! <cf>You're a vile priest. You can have it!
Indeed, the adult money is ......
...... Scary voices. Now what?
I hope you don't mind. We are just foolish enough to try to take advantage of the prestige of Einrain <cf>
They don't have a shred of faith, they only care about taking advantage of you <cf>
There is no need to tell the faithless the word of God in Bapharia <cf>
...... It's been a long time coming, but it looks like the distractions are behind us. <cf>Let's get out there and see what we can find.
Are you also contributors?
Yeah, well ......
Now, you speak properly. <cf>You made it all this way for a priestess, didn't you?
Uh, uh, let's see, ...... this to the oracle priestess ......!
Is the flower crown ......
I made them from flowers in the village!　Oh, but for decoration <cf>I had these people pick the beautiful flowers for me.
The oracle priestesses seem to have a hard time making the pilgrimage, so I thought <cf>I'd be happy if these flower crowns would soothe them a little.
Um, so ...... that ......
I would love to be a priestess of the Order someday and help <cf>the oracle priestesses!
So, miko, please wait until then!
……！
Oh, that ......!
<span size="Big">Hyah!　Mi, miko-sama! &lt;/&gt;
Dear Einrain!　I told you that you should not go outside <cf>without warning!
Sorry, I'm not sure what to say. But ......
Good luck on your pilgrimage, miko! <cf>So, uh, if you don't mind, I'd like to see the flowers at ......!
Thanks ....... Very beautiful flower crown.
I'm ...... happy. Really ......
Miko ......!
You both have nice smiles on your faces.
It's good to have this kind of relaxation between tough pilgrimages. <cf>
I don't have any ...... choice at all. ......
O girl of faith! <cf>Let me reward you for making the priestess smile.
Huh?　Wow, sweets!
...... Please keep the rest of us in the dark.
Yes, I am!　Thank you very much!
Hmmm... ......
Mm-hmm. I guess I'll have to go with a gift <cf>that's thoughtful.
Well, I would be most happy with money that comes from the heart!
Picked flowers and plants to make flower crowns.
What's the matter?　You've been strangely quiet since a while ago.
...... No, nothing in particular.
[--]Dear Aerinse, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but <cf>are you perhaps hungry?
What?　What? How did you know?
Because Mr. Aerinse has a habit of getting <cf>spaced out and silent when he's hungry.
Oh, I see. <cf>I hate that, I hadn't noticed that at all: ......
Let's get something for you. <cf>Do you have something to eat?
What I want to eat: ......
......I want some sweet cake!
I'm sorry. That's impossible. <cf>It's just a little difficult here.
Perhaps Salamzart's food <cf>doesn't suit your palate?
No, no! <cf>Just a little spicy, I guess. ......
Because of the local cuisine, there are many spicy dishes here. <cf>I surely miss sweet cakes.
Well, Feste? <cf>I love cakes too, you know!
When I was in the original time, Tyris and I used to have <cf>tea parties.
A lot of colorful little cakes on a <cf>plate ......
It was very delicious. Hey, Tyris.
Uh, yeah. Yes, I know. ......
But is the cake ...... cake or ......
It's not that I don't want to eat it right now. <cf>And this is not the time to be talking about such things [--].
No, I think as long as you have the ingredients, you can make it work. <cf>Yes, even I can do at least cupcakes: ......
Um, seniors. I'm sorry, may I ask you to gather <cf>the ingredients for the cupcakes?
Thank you very much! <cf>...... and please wait a moment!
Here is the list of materials and money. <cf>Please show it to the clerk at the store.
I'll negotiate to rent the kitchen at the bar <cf>and we'll meet up there later.
Yay, cake, cake! <cf>I'm going to eat a lot of cake!
Sorry, my selfishness. ...... <cf>Thank you very much.
Yes, come on in! <cf>We have a good selection here.
Umm, can you please get the materials in this memo to <cf>in a little bit?
Yes yes yes ...... what do you make of this?
Sweet, sweet cupcakes!
Oh, cupcakes. <cf>I'll throw in some extra sugar for you, then.
And [--] hmm?
Hey, are these all ingredients for cupcakes?
Yeah?　Is that so?
Hmmm, interesting stuff to use. Well, okay.
Yes, I've got all the ingredients. <cf>I'm not much for sweets, but I hope I can make it right.
Well then, I hope to see you again!
I haven't had a sweet treat in a long time. I'm looking forward to it....... <cf>Let's head to the bar where Tyris and his friends are.
I see that you bought the ingredients. <cf>Thank you.
We have just negotiated with <cf>to rent the kitchen as well!
Oh, then let's get to it!　Then let's get to it. <cf>I'll help you.
Oh, no, I'm fine on my own. It's a simple thing. <cf>You can all sit and wait.
Is that so?　Then I'll have to wait.
I'm looking forward to it. <cf>I look forward to working with you, Tyris.
Yes, you can!
Thank you for your patience. <cf>Your cupcakes are ready!
Well, how cute!
Oh, this looks delicious!
We made a lot of them. <cf>Don't hesitate to eat as many as you like!
Well, I won't hold back. That's it!
Ah!　That's no good! <cf>I'll put it on a plate properly!　Wait!
No need to wait for something delicious. <cf>Well, I'm off to dinner!
That's a real no-no!
♪ Snap, snap, snap ♪
Oh, ......!
Available at: ....... <cf>............
<span size="Big">Goodbye World&lt;/&gt;.
Kyaaaah! <cf>Mr. Feste has collapsed, bubbling over!
Oh my God!　I will go and call someone!
Master Aerinse, please wait!　Master Aerinse!
Tyris, what in the world did you do to the cupcakes?
Do you know, I didn't put any poison in it! <cf>I just made a cake for me to eat: ......
[--]Hiyara!　Nyanzohore!　It's so hot! <cf>It's so spicy that it'll make your mouth water!
Good, you're awake. <cf>Yes, please have some water.
[--]Puhah! <cf>Rameja, my tongue is numb. ......
Tyris, this is ......
I'm sorry ......, I actually have a sweet tooth. <cf>That's why I've been making cupcakes for myself to a very spicy specification: ......
Wahi will chatter about it.
That's why I told you to wait until I had to sort it out. <cf>Mr. Feste ignores that, so you can go to ......
Hare?　Hero oshu to ehinji wa <cf>sweet monore tea kai shireira to ......
...... Mr. Aerinse doesn't know that <cf>I don't have a sweet tooth!
What is it? I should have said "Hiyan", you know.
It is my duty to do the Lord's will. <cf>To that end, it does not matter what my preferences are.
For me, the best thing to do is to keep Master Aerinse smiling <cf>
Mu......
Seniors, would you please go to <cf>and see how Mr. Aerinse is doing?
Maybe you went to the clerk at the counter <cf>to ask for help, so
Thank you very much. <cf>And ...... please keep this story confidential.
Oh, I was just asking the clerk for some water at ....... <cf>Is Mr. Feste ok?
Okay, good. ......
Perhaps you've been listening?
Sorry about ....... <cf>I was trying to go back once and that's when I went to ......
I was so full of myself <cf>that I didn't even try to know what Tyris liked!
......We consider her a friend. <cf>But you are making sacrifices for such a trivial thing
I hate myself like that, I can't help it. ......
Next time we have a tea party, let's have some spicy food.
...... No, no. It shouldn't.
If I prepare spicy food without saying anything, I'll hurt the pride of <cf>Tyris, who has kept quiet so far!
So until ...... Tyris comes out and says it himself, <cf>I'd like to pretend I've been duped!
Now, let's get back before Tyris and the others find out. <cf>We must continue with the tea party.
And ...... please keep this story <cf>confidential!
Well, Tyris. <cf>I'd like to talk about how we're going to move forward [--].
It's ......, but it's still ....... <cf>It's ...... still ......
Tyris?　Hey, Tillis-?
[--]Ha!　Yes, what is it?
What is it? Are you all right? <cf>You were mumbling to yourself. ......
No, it's okay!　Don't worry about it.
Really?　If there's something on your mind, I'm here to help you, okay? <cf>In the meantime, I'll start with one case, 100 Lunos.
...... In that case, may I leave you in charge of Mr. Aerinse's escort for a bit <cf>?
I have a few personal things I need to finish now.
Okay, I've been assigned an escort!
Thank you very much. <cf>Really, I will be back soon!
Something fishy about ....... <cf>I'm getting a bottle on my antler.
I have a feeling that something ...... and <cf>interesting and funny is about to happen. ......
The direction in which he ran off is the direction of the temple ...... or
All right, my servant. <cf>Let's take Aerinse with us and follow him... ♪
Tyris...... can't find it.
That's funny, isn't it? <cf>I thought it went this way: ...... Ah!
Einrain! <cf>Have you seen Tyris around here?
Tyris ......?
I just came in. We talked a little bit. ......
Oh!　What did you tell him?
What kind of gift would make you happy? ....... <cf>I answered that I would be most happy with a 'thought'. ......
A gift ...... noh. So where's Tyris?
I went to the square I think ...... ......
Okay, well, thanks for the info.
All right, let's go to the square.
Tyris...... I don't see it here either.
Ho-ho-ho, don't try to move around in secret from us <cf>. We're a hundred years too early. We will find you. ......
Hey, you three. You're giving off an aura of bad character. <cf>What are you doing [--] Gohon!　What are you doing?
Electra. <cf>Have you seen Tyris around here?
Are you Tyris? <cf>Yes, he was here just a few minutes ago.
You asked me what are Salamzart's specialties. <cf>What food is most popular among the devotees?　And ......
So I just asked people and went to <cf>the city entrance/exit.
I thought it was a specialty?　Hmmm ....... <cf>How was Tyris then?
I don't know?　Even if it's different than usual, <cf>I'm not close enough to know that and ......
So be it. <cf>Oh well, thanks for the tip.
Now we're going to the entrance/exit of the city. <cf>Let's go there.
Tyris!　There you are, in a place like this.
Mr. Aerinse!　And the seniors! <cf>Why ......
I was just wondering. <cf>By the way, were you out alone at ......?
Oh, that ...... I need a few things.
Hou?　What do you need [--]?
Sorry!　Freshness is important! <cf>I'm in a hurry, so here we go!
Ah!　Holy shit, wait!
What's going on?　In such a hurry ......
I asked Einlein about gifts and <cf>Electra about specialties and food ......
And if you were to go out of town to pick <cf>something that 'freshness is important' ......
What if it becomes?
I don't know!　Let's go after Tyris anyway.
Tyris, I found it!
Oh, you're already here: ......
Ho-ho-ho, you're 200 years too young to be trying to steal our eyes. <cf>And now what?　What is your business?
You are my servant. Now, answer me.
...... We had no choice. And that's why we managed to get there in time.
That ...... senior. <cf>Please accept this!
Oh?　This is [--]
Bento ......?
Bento ......?
Oh, um, I've always been very grateful to my seniors ...... and <cf>but I've never been able to give anything back to them.
So I thought I'd at least give you a gift of some kind. <cf>Einrain told me that feelings are important. ......
So I asked Electra a lot of questions and <cf>made a lunch box with some of Salamzart's specialties.
It's not perfect, but it's ....... <cf>I put a lot of gratitude into it. ......
Oh, it's a Salamzart specialty. <cf>We've made it not so spicy!
So, uh, I was wondering if you could receive this: ......
Well, ......!　Isn't this the first time Tyris has cooked for someone other than me and my family <cf>?
Ha, yes ....... <cf>I thought it might be handmade or 'heavy'. ......
Thank you very much.
Seniors: ......!
It was just a thank-you event. <cf>I had a hunch it would be fun, but I guess my horns are not as good as they used to be.
By the way, ...... you said when we met earlier <cf>that "freshness is important".
That was for lunch box ingredients, wasn't it? <cf>What on earth is in them?
Yes, I'm here!　Salamzart's specialty <cf>"Dancing Mein"!
<span size="Big">Eh ......&lt;/&gt;
It is a specialty of Salamzart, where freshness is the key to success, with the still tender Miin, less than 3 days old, tossed with <cf>spices!
I tasted it myself and it is very tasty, so please do!
......!
My hunch on the eagle's horn was still excellent. ......
Come on, seniors. Don't hesitate to eat!
E, Aerinse. ......!
...... Please accept Tyris's thoughts and prayers!
Seniors?　......Are you still annoyed?
--!
...... Oh, it's pretty good!
One ......2 sheet ......3 sheet ....... <cf>It's still not enough. ......
What is it? <cf>You're counting pages in your notebook with a gloomy face.
Oh, you guys can go to ......!
Actually [--] no, I'm still good. <cf>I'll take care of this myself.
That makes me even more curious. <cf>What, were you counting love letters to Einlein?
No, sir!　It is a diary!　[--] Ah!
Oh, ho-ho-ho, a diary, huh?
...... Well, while running away from the bug, <cf>I think I dropped some pieces of paper that I had tucked into my notebook!
The content is more of a personal diary or complaint ......, <cf>It's really just a scribble and it's not worth it.
However, the fact that the pages don't line up makes <cf>uncomfortable or unsettling.
So, that ......
This is not right!　Abandoning those in need <cf>is a matter of pride for an adventurer!
That piece of paper you dropped, <cf>we'll find it for you. Hey, servant!
You're not very good with bugs, so you can't go around looking for them, can you? <cf>Einrain would be sad if something happened to you again, wouldn't she?
I'm very grateful for the offer. ......, <cf>Sounds like some strange fun, doesn't it?
What?　Nothing? <cf>(I'd love to read what people have to complain about. I want to read it.)
It's straight from the heart, though!
Leave it to us to find the piece of paper.
Leave it to us to find the piece of paper.
U...... but yeah. <cf>I still feel weird about losing it, and ......
Thank you for your time and help in finding the pieces of paper. <cf>I have a total of four lost pieces of paper.
So, if you can, I'd be happy if you could find it <cf>and not read it ......
<span size="Big">Mm, I don't read it, I don't read it! &lt;/&gt;
I don't trust it!　I appreciate your sentiments though ......, so <cf>please help me find a piece of paper!
Oh, is this the piece of paper that York lost? <cf>Hmm, what is it, ......?
&lt;My father put out the laundry and there were colored items mixed in with the laundry. I told him every time to separate them because the colors would <cf>shift! &gt;
＜When I warned him, he replied, "[You] are too detailed. I warned him, but he replied, "[You] are too detailed. <cf>leave that kind of work to the maids.
&lt;This is why work people are ....... First, laundry is <cf>my stress reliever and I will never give it up.
...... I see. <cf>So this is the family situation of the Duke of Bernhardt's Knight Commander.
Is this a piece of paper from York?　Which one? ......?
&lt;The other day my father came home with some sweets.
&lt;The most customary "Veronica's mother made <cf>a gift for the Knights of the Order ......
&lt;I mean, it's just a snack, but <cf>Father, you've got to realize that.
&lt;It was handmade by Veronica herself: ......&gt;
&lt;Veronica, why don't you just confess it? <cf>I guess I'll have to tell you in person to get through to your insensitive father.
＜It's frustrating to watch. <cf>I don't know what to do. ......&gt;
Hoho ...... hoho ...... this is this ......
Oh, there's a piece of paper!　Let's have a look: ......
&lt;I am troubled by Mr. Hugo's love for women. <cf>If he were a civilian officer, he would be the best of the best. ......&gt;
&lt;I don't want to get too close to Einrain, so <cf>let's not turn in any documents related to the Order.
Hugo: ....... Huh, where have I heard that before?
I got a piece of paper!　Now what's inside: ......?
&lt;I've done a bad thing to Carvein. When things are resolved <cf>, the three of us can go on vacation to Cape Rauwehara.
＜Carvein, who is too serious, needs a break.
&lt;The question is how to get Einlein out of there: ....... <cf>I know he'll be pissed, but I guess we'll just have to use Father's authority.
&lt;But I don't care if she's pissed off. <cf>I want her to enjoy her freedom.
Hmmm ...... these three seem to get along really well.
Sorry for the wait. I was able to retrieve four pieces of paper!
Thank you very much! <cf>So, what's inside: ......
Read.
Right, yes. It's okay. I understand.
It's not really something to be embarrassed about. <cf>You were way too cute to be a bitch.
I was expecting more of an intelligent bespectacled character <cf>with a black belly. ......
What the heck kind of image am I: ......
Oh well. <cf>I'm relieved to have the pieces of paper together in this way.
I'm a nervous wreck anyway, <cf>everything has to be done right.
In that aspect, I think I'd be a good civil servant. ......
I think my ...... father would have really wanted me to become a fine knight <cf>like him!
What are you talking about? Parents are parents and children are children. <cf>As long as you know your talents and make the most of them, there will be no problem.
Well, ultimately, it is good for parents to know that their children are doing well <cf>. No need to be so anxious about it.
I think I know why ...... Einlein and Carvein trust <cf>you guys!
Well, we're going to go now [--].
I still have some work to do, so I'll be here a little while longer.
I see. Be careful not to get attacked by bugs again.
Don't worry. <cf>I've got the bug repellent burning perfectly now!
So, ...... thank you both <cf>so much!
Oh, see you later!
I thought if I told ...... bitch they would look for it. <cf>Glad to have this back in hand.
I'm sorry <cf>for being so deceitful, but ......
I do what I can do. <cf>Yes ...... parents are parents and children are children.
[--]Okay, a quick sear so it doesn't burn ...... <cf>and connect the pieces of paper together ...... and it's a bit of a puzzle... ...
...... Now you're done!
The words of the imprisoned Lord King. <cf>We need to get it to that man as soon as possible. ......
Oh, ....... <cf>Are you free by any chance?
If that's the case, let me ask you to do a little work for me. <cf>I'm in a bit of a bind.
Trouble, you say?　I'm all ears, but ......
Yes, actually, two members of the ...... congregation are missing.
It's not safe in this area. I was doing research to <cf>examine the path of future pilgrimages [--].
Two members of the congregation we sent as investigators to <cf>have yet to return.
The others are tired from serving, and <cf>I would like to go directly to the search.
These two are dispatched to geographically opposite locations <cf>......
Simply put, we don't have enough manpower.
Yes, I'm ashamed to admit it, but you're right.
In case you are involved in something dangerous, <cf>we need to help you out as soon as possible!
So, if you don't mind, <cf>we could use your help.
Understood. I'll help in the search.
Okay, I'll help you find him. I'll help you in your search.
<span size="Big">Sssshhhh!　We got a manpower! &lt;/&gt;
[--]Gohon!　No, thank you very much. <cf>The gods of Bapharia will be very pleased with your service.
Uh, ......, you can use a plain tone of voice if you want. <cf>I know how hard it is to wear a catsuit.
Oh my, here is my plain tone. <cf>I don't know what you mean by catcalls. ...... ughhhhhh...
Now, please get back on track. <cf>I will note the search area on the map, so that you can see what we are looking for.
Please find our lost congregation!
Um, is your sister a cult member?
Eh ......, yes. Yes, but ......
Are you lost by any chance?　We <cf>Accepted a search request from Electra ......
...... now what?
......?　Electra asked me to find a lost congregation <cf>......
<span size="Big">Huh!　It works on the mind! &lt;/&gt;
What?　What is it?
Oh, I'm sorry, ....... <cf>That ...... Electra, were you worried about me?
Oh, oh ....... If you're involved in something dangerous, <cf>we need to get you out of there as soon as possible, [--].
So that's the kind of thing that makes me moe!
Heehee!　What's been going on for a while now!
Oh, I'm sorry. That's Electra's sister, <cf>and I was so impressed ......
Sister, Dear ......?
Yes. Sister Electra is <cf>worthy of being called "Sister"!
That man has only been in the Order for a short time, but <cf>his strength has been a focus of attention from the beginning!
And in recognition of his loyalty and faith, <cf>he was soon chosen to be Master Einrain's bodyguard.
Oh, ...... because that strength is certainly eye-catching.
And she's beautiful, isn't she?　There's something wild about her <cf>and the occasional glimpse of roughness that makes her even more attractive.
He does his duty well after all. <cf>He is dependable and caring.
But sometimes she shows a bit of a screw-up, which makes her even more attractive <cf>and I don't know what to do anymore.
Okay, okay. Calm down. Hi, deep breaths.
Suu[~~~]...... haa[~~]......
Sorry about ....... I get so passionate when I talk <cf>about your sister Electra!
We can't keep her waiting forever. <cf>Go back to Salamzart and show her your face.
Well, yes! <cf>We don't want to cause you any more trouble.
By the way, you, your tone is different from earlier: ......
Eh?　What is it?
Oh no, we are similar in that way. ......　Electra's sister also <cf>often makes such obvious deceptions, but that's the way it's done.
deep breath
Let's get back to Electra quickly, my servant. <cf>I'm getting a little tired of ...... eagle.
Sorry to keep you waiting. The congregation is safe.
Oh, good! <cf>We just got another one here, too.
So now both of us are safe. <cf>I'm really glad: ......
I'm sorry, Master Electra! <cf>We lost our bearings in the sandstorm.
I'm sorry to have bothered you, too. ......
...... Okay?　If anything happens to you guys, <cf>Einrain will be heartbroken, okay?
I don't work out <cf>in a way that would grieve the oracle priestesses I am supposed to support!
Ha, yes!　I am sorry!
If you feel sorry, have an eye for danger! <cf>If you think it's dangerous, pull back!　Feel it instinctively!
If you can't even protect yourself, God has no blessing on you!
...... quite a bit, tough guy.
I order you who blundered to be suspended. <cf>Rest for two days.
Huh?　Is that ......
Okay?　Don't help me clean up or anything, okay? <cf>Just lie around, okay?
Being lost in the desert takes more damage <cf>than you think. Eat, sleep, and make sure your body recovers.
<span size="Big">Sister ......! &lt;/&gt;
[--]Gosh!　Sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a downer. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation.
It's not much, but the reward is here: ....... <cf>Thank you so much!
Well, I'll leave you to it. <cf>I will report the details to Mr. Einrain.
How ...... I see. Well, well, well.
Hey?　Hey! <cf>It's so good, right?　You know what I mean!
The way she scolds with kindness while saying harsh things! <cf>Oh, my God, that's Electra's sister!
Oh, shit, him too!
You know, it's so easy to cut off a lowly guy like us <cf>, and then you even send out a search request.
I was even rescued by my sister herself. <cf>She was so cool!　I couldn't help but fall in love with her!
What a cunning idea!　Details!
You know, I was hiding behind a rock, hiding from the monsters <cf>and then my sister came to me there, so [--]
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it. <cf>I can't do it, I'm going to increase my faith in you.
Let's go to ....... It's a space we can't follow.
It's enough to know that types like Electra are <cf>popular with women. ......
So your sister is...!
Oh no, my faith is growing!　I have to write in the bulletin!
Is it really impossible? I would pay extra money.
That being said, <cf>what we don't have is what we do have ......
I'll take care of that. I know it's a lot to ask.
But ......
What's the matter?　There seems to be some kind of trouble.
Oh, Feste! <cf>You came just in time!
I'm sorry, but help me convince this gentleman to <cf>not. Feste, you're a talker. ......
Hey, hey, who's just talking? Who's the one?
......? <cf>Are you the adventurers who were in ...... "[Insect Fortress] in [Insect Fortress]" ......?
Hmm?　[--]Ah!　You are the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Bernhardt, <cf>the knight who was by Dunkirk!　I believe his name is [--]
Veronica. I'm the Deputy Commander.
What in the world did this deputy commander order from such an ungrateful merchant <cf>?
Who's the udatsu no kakaran (a merchant with no prospects for success)? Who are you?
Well, this is payback for what I said earlier! <cf>[What's so unreasonable about that?
It's "The Fresh Leaves of Ailaza." <cf>Feste, you know what I'm talking about.
Ah ...... the flowers and plants used for dyes. <cf>The ones that dye blue, right?
Yes. The flowers and grasses that make up the <cf>unique deep, bright blue that reminds us of the sea in our Asterleeds.
But now is not the season. <cf>And it's time to run out of stock everywhere [--].
But I really want a blue scarf dyed with <cf>
...... and well, it's been like this for a while now.
Do you really need it now? <cf>In a few weeks, it will be easier to collect them.
Then it will be available in Bernhardt as an import. <cf>Why not buy them then?
...... that's not good enough. It won't make it in time.
Muuu......I'm in trouble......
[--]Ah!
What's up, Feste?
I think I might have an idea.
What?　Really!
I was wandering around Asteria Plain once <cf>and saw an early blooming "Fresh Leaves of Ailaza"!
But it was a monster-infested area. <cf>At that time we had to run back [--].
[Now he's here.
[--]!
Earlier, you said you would pay us extra money, right? <cf>If he is telling the truth, we will go and get it for you.
There is no such thing as a falsehood in a knight. <cf>Especially a knight of the mighty Bernhardt.
I'll take care of it too! <cf>As long as I have the dye, I can fulfill the order!
[--] So, what do we do now?
We have no choice. Let's go pick some.
Mm, I've accepted this request!
Yes. By the way, <cf>can you pick me some "talakua nuts" too?
When cooked together, they produce a prettier color. <cf>This one is a perennial, so you won't have trouble collecting it.
The "fresh leaves of Ailaza" and the "fruits of Talaqua"? <cf>Good. I'll take a cut of the commission for that.
Yes, of course. Nice to meet you.
Well then, my servant, let's head out. <cf>There are two places to collect. Are you ready?
I've picked up some "fresh leaves of ailaza" and "talakua berries". <cf>Is this enough?
Oh!　A scarf or so is plenty enough!
Okay, I'll go ask our craftsman now. <cf>Hold on a second.
What do you think?　I think the colors came out beautifully. ......
Mmm, it's a beautiful blue!　It feels great to the touch. <cf>I bet Veronica would love it!
All right, all right! <cf>If Feste says so, you betcha.
Oh, I'm sorry, but could you do me another favor? <cf>I need you to take this to Lady Veronica.
I've got some business to attend to after this. <cf>Veronica is in the temple.
I don't have a choice. I'll take delivery charges, okay?
Then let's go, my servant. <cf>We'll run all the way to the temple!
I have a delivery for Veronica. ...... hmm?
Oh?　You guys were at that ......
Dada, Dunkirk!
Well, well, well. Since there is a Deputy Commander, Veronica, shouldn't there be a <cf>Commander, Dunkirk, ......
You are very gallant to call out to Mr. Dunkirk.
Ha-ha-ha, don't be so cross with me. <cf>He went to the trouble of delivering it to you, didn't he?
It is ....... Yes, that's right. ...... Yes
Yes, that's right. Here, this is a delivery from the merchant. <cf>You may accept it.
Can I check here now?
Unless you have a problem with it. I think the workmanship is good.
Okay. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to ......
...... how. What a vibrant blue.
Yes, great ....... <cf>Exactly what I ordered.
Isn't that right?　The merchant's craftsmen are highly respected <cf>
No, it is truly beautiful. <cf>It is indeed a product of a trading city.
I'm sure it will look great on you. <cf>You picked a good one, Veronica.
No, this is for Mr. Dunkirk.
Me?
...... I heard that your wife liked this color from Asterleeds <cf>. Since we have come all the way to the area.
Ma'am ......?
...... Oh, yeah. That's right. Thanks.
I'm going to take a break. I need you to give instructions to the soldiers.
Ha!
...... I believe the wife of Dunkirk [--], <cf>passed away a long time ago, didn't she? ......
...... it's almost the anniversary of his wife's death.
Every year, no matter how busy he is, Mr. Dunkirk visits <cf>his wife's grave on the anniversary of her death.
When you do, be sure to take with you <cf>something that your wife loved!
I've been ...... doing it that way for over 15 years now ......
Well ...... you took good care of your wife ......
Mr. Dunkirk is still walking with his wife. <cf>His thoughts will never fade away.
That man will always have his wife in his heart. ......
Are you ......?
Thank you for your efforts in collecting the dye and delivering the gift. <cf>I will pay you as promised.
Well, I'll leave you to it. <cf>Good luck to you all.
What can I say, the more ...... capable a woman is, the more she treads on air and <cf>the more she treads on her feet. ......
In some cases it's a little ...... frustrating!
That's ......
Dear Aerinse, how can I help you[--]?
[--]!　Traces of avaritia!
Mr. Aerinse, please stand by me! <cf>Seniors, please check your surroundings!
Oh, oh!
...... No sign of Avaritia as far as the eye can see, but what about <cf>Omnistron?
There is a trace amount of response. <cf>Looks like they are hanging around the street area.
...... but judging by the traces <cf>is not an avaritia that should be released!
To avoid running into each other, go to <cf>and bypass the street from here!
What ......?　Are you going to leave Avaritia at <cf>as is?
Yes, because it is not subject to release.
So, but being near a street means that <cf>other people are in danger ......
That is a possibility. <cf>But we need not lay a hand on it.
Oh no!　I don't want to <cf>turn a blind eye when I know there is danger!
...... is not our role. <cf>We should avoid unnecessary fighting.
Besides, careless interference may affect the future of <cf>
But [--]
I will say it again. It is not our role. <cf>Please hear me out, Mr. Aerinse.
Tyris......
Well, well, well. I'm sure we both have our arguments, but <cf>there's no point in pushing and shoving here.
In the meantime, why don't you just take a look at that avaritia at <cf>?　It's a bit of a hassle to go around the streets.
If it seems safe to leave it alone, <cf>just let it pass by. Hmm?
Such a compromise is [--].
Tyris, a servant must do what his master says.
Seniors: ......
Yes, yes!　Good?　Tyris. <cf>As long as you have a contract, you are my servant!
...... I understand. <cf>I'm just going to go check on you for now.
All right!　Let's go!
...... Um, thank you!
I don't see any avaritia in sight. ......
Dear Aerinse, please do not leave my side.
Tyris. If Aerinse sticks to you any longer, <cf>you'd rather not be able to walk?
......
Hey, you've been a little <cf>uptight earlier, haven't you?
It's tense to watch. <cf>You don't want to put unnecessary tension on your fellow man, do you?
Sorry ....... I had a bit of a bad feeling about this.
I know you're sensitive about the avaritia, <cf>but don't be so uptight, we're here too!
Yes, Tyris. <cf>Don't take on too much alone. ......
I am sorry. <cf>But I am Mr. Aerinse's escort.
Even with the help of my seniors, <cf>I cannot be distracted!
I am only here to protect Mr. Aerinse, <cf>
The relevant avaritia does not seem to be <cf>around here anymore. Let's move on.
...... Tyris and Omnistron!
[--]!　Yes, sir!
What's up?　I don't see Avaritia around, but ......
This sign ...... of Tyris's bad feeling <cf>may have been right!
What's that ......?
Dear Aerinse, this is ...... <cf>a trace of Voldigen!
After all, ......
The Dragon King? <cf>He was here?
Yes. This [mo][ya] is the mark where Voldigen ate <cf>avaritia!
Oh, hey, are you all right? <cf>If he's still around, this time we'll [--]
Please remain calm. <cf>Fortunately, there is no reaction from Voldigen itself.
What is the response from other avalitiers?
There is one a short distance from here.
From the traces, ...... it appears that Voldigen and <cf>two Avalitia engaged here!
So, it looks like one of them got eaten and ...... <cf>the other one got away.
...... that one to the street down the road?
Yes, we are still moving there. We are still moving there now.
This can no longer be called a wait-and-see situation. <cf>We're going around quickly!
Avaritia, for example, who engaged the Dragon King, <cf>would be in a state of excitement and out of control by now!
So, but the people on the street are at ......!
...... In this case, the avaritia that got away should be <cf>taken down!
What? <cf>You are saying something different from what you said before!
I am sorry. <cf>But in a way, I thought this could be an opportunity.
What?　What do you mean?
I explained to you that Voldigen is <cf>gaining strength ...... by eating avaritia, right?
There are levels to that avaritia. <cf>There is no point in eating all the small fry!
The fact that Voldigen went out of his way to eat it means that <cf>the avaritia that escaped must be of a certain strength ......
We can't just let it slide and let Voldigen <cf>continue to build up his power!
I'll take him out before he goes after it again.
No, no, no!　No matter how much the Dragon King is absent, <cf>it is dangerous to approach a manhandled beast!
First of all, it is your role to protect Aerinse, <cf>isn't it!
If Voldigen gains any more power, <cf>we will not be able to protect Mr. Aerinse in the near future!
It is in our best interest to reduce their power here and now.
Nuuuuh ...... certainly has a point ...... but ......
All right, I'll do as Tillis says. I'll do as Tyris says.
I understand. I'll do what Tyris says.
[--]Yeah, we don't have a choice! <cf>If this happens, we're going to take down Avaritia!
There he is!　It's avaritia!
That Avaritia ...... <cf>looks tougher than I imagined ......
Rest assured, I will take care of you here!
Aerinse is safe with Eagle! <cf>The servant is with Tyris for avaritia!
Teiyaaaa!
Tyris, you did an outstanding job.
Well, yeah, I'm Accept trained, so <cf>of course!
I am more worried about Master Aerinse than anything else. <cf>Let's join them as soon as possible.
Tyris......！！
I saw how you fought! <cf>That blow was a real coup de grace!
...... because I'm Mr. Aerinse's escort.
Yes, I am so proud of you <cf>for being my escort. Because [--]
By defeating that avaritia, <cf>we were able to protect the people on the streets.
...... it is consequential. <cf>I am protecting Mr. Aerinse [--].
It's all about results. <cf>It saved a lot of lives.
So take heart in that fact, Tyris.
I'm really glad I trusted ...... you and asked you to escort me to <cf>
Dear Aerinse: ......
...... I am the one who is proud <cf>to be Master Aerinse's escort!
Well, hmmm. <cf>We are so compatible, aren't we?
I can't believe I'm in love with you!　I'm so afraid!
Uh, ...... sorry to be flirting with you, <cf>, but shouldn't we get going?
Ha, yes!　Yes, yes! <cf>Yes, um [--]
What is it? What's wrong?
...... seniors, thank you again for your help and <cf>sincere appreciation!
I'm a bit of a hard-head, so I apologize for the inconvenience. <cf>Please keep up the good work!
Hmmm?　Well, I don't appreciate <cf>the squire love that kept us out of it, but I do appreciate the thank-you.
Well, now that we have one less thing to worry about, let's go to <cf>Salamzart
Oh. That was a long way around.
(...... Even though I think I can do everything on my own, <cf>I still don't have enough power)
(But there are people who can help me with that)
(And there is a Lord who believes in me like that)
(For these people, <cf>I must fulfill my mission)
(No matter what the cost in the future [--] <cf>I will always protect Mr. Aerinse!)
What is it, you two?　What are you two staring at? <cf>What's so unusual about town?
Yes, I have seen the big cities of this time period. I've never looked closely at <cf>the big cities of this era, so I've never looked closely at ......
It is much livelier than I imagined. <cf>The whole place is lively.
Hmmm!　A city this big is a rarity, even for those of <cf>the future!
Since you're here, how about I show you around <cf>?　Hmm?
Well, that's all right!
Maybe later <span size="Big">charge a guiding fee&lt;/&gt; or ......
(go figure. ......)
Tyris, you mustn't say such a thing. <cf>Mr. Feste said it out of the kindness of his heart.
Hey, Mr. Feste. Yes, I know.
Gosh ......!　Innocent eyes gouge the heart......!
......?　Can I help you?
Gugu ......Gununu ......!
[--]Oh, God, I get it!　I don't take money. <cf>From the bottom of my heart, it's a bona fide guide!
You see, Tyris? <cf>Isn't that what I said?
I'm sure you've struggled a lot in your mind. <cf>If that's the case with Feste, I'll indulge you.
I'm going to get myself killed. <cf>All of you, including the servants, follow me!
From now on, <cf>Asterleeds Grand Tour by the eternally beautiful Feste will begin!
Best regards!
Well, let's first go to Arena, the largest building in Asterleeds and a <cf>tourist attraction!
This is the Arena! <cf>Isn't it amazing how big it is?
This is the Arena: ......
Do you fight here ......?
Yes! <cf>The place is crammed full of fierce competitors who are confident in their skills [--].
Sure, <span size="Big">is narrow&lt;/&gt;.
...... yeah?
Yes, and the building is about to collapse. <cf>Does the building meet the standards for earthquake-resistant construction?
............ Unh?
It's hard for people in this day and age to have to fight in a place like this <cf>......
Will it last a few more decades ......? <cf>Well, it is a historic building.
Oh, Tyris. Look at this. <cf>It's a souvenir!
On a pennant with the name of the city, ...... is this a wooden sword? <cf>Is this what the city is famous for?
Hey, can we bring these back as souvenirs for everyone? <cf>If it's enough to take to the Chronogate, it would be good, right?
So, let's buy everything around here [--].
Don't wait for me! <cf>What is wrong with you to pay so much money for such a thing!
And you're ignoring the Arena and going for the standard souvenirs! <cf>This pride of mine, the one who guided me, is crumbling!
But not Arena in particular: ......
We are used to seeing huge structures. ......
I understand ....... I understand very well. As a beautiful girl who has known Asterleeds for <cf>long enough, I won't miss it this time.
Next stop is the town gate square!　That one will surely hit the spot <cf>in your hearts!　Let's go!
How about it? <cf>You'll only find a sight like this in Asterleeds!
Well, you can go to ......!
Great ......!
Behold this beautiful array of images! <cf>A perfect use of the heritage of the Bapharia civilization [--].
What a <span size="Big">dated system&lt;/&gt;!
And I can't believe it is still in use! <cf>I never dreamed that I would be able to see it with my own eyes!
...... oh?
Why does this only show a flat image?
............ Oh?
That's the way it is, Mr. Aerinse. <cf>That is the limit of this system.
Well, ...... that's a huge inconvenience.
But it's amazing! <cf>I can't believe they are running something this old.
Thank you, Feste. <cf>This is a wonderful historical legacy [--].
Mr. Feste?　How can I help you?
You are from the future, aren't you? <cf>Of course, this stuff is too old to even talk about.
Defeat ......!　I introduced the latest technology to a futurist with a smug look on my face <cf>I'm defeated ......!
Oh no!　I was impressed to see the <cf>fossil-like technology that only remains in the documents!
That's right! <cf>You call our latest technology a fossil!
Huh?　Oh, uh, ......!
......I'm hungry. Wanna go to the market?
......I'm hungry. Wanna go to the market?
(Nice follow-up, seniors!)
Market?　Hmmm, there's nothing to show the future <cf>anyway!
That's not true. Let's go!　Market! <cf>Hey?　Both seniors and Master Aerinse!
Yes, I'm looking forward to it!　I'm looking forward to it!
Hmmm ......
(...... sulking)
(...... sulked)
(Totally sulking ......)
......So, for now, the market is next~......
Yes, this is the marketplace: ......
What's the matter with you, dumbass? You don't sell this old-fashioned stuff to future Asterleeds at <cf>?
No ...... that ......, <cf>surprised that the market is so busy ......
So many fresh fruits and vegetables ....... <cf>It's like a dream. ......
What?　 <span size="Big">Is such a mon&lt;/&gt; rare?
In our time, the influence of avaritia was <cf>so strong and intense that ......
Fresh fruits and vegetables from the land are almost unheard of <cf>!
So, then, what about the food?
The general public is largely a processed nutritional food. <cf>Fresh foods are not nearly as accessible!
So, the sight of a marketplace like this, crowded with people, is very <cf>...... in our time.
......This planet was so rich. <cf>It wasn't just a fantasy in a book......
(...... How about the beach next time? <cf>I'm sure you two would love it.)
(Yes, that's right. I will take you up on your offer.)
Okay, next time, shut up and follow me! <cf>I'll show you the best places to go!
Blue ...... this is the ocean ......!
There are amazing ...... people swimming ......!
Tyris, Tyris! <cf>Something's wrong with my feet!　The water is closing in!
Watch out!　Please be careful [--] cold!
...... Wow, that's salty! <cf>Seawater really does have salt in it. ......
Don't drink, don't drink. <cf>You'll be thirsty later, okay?
Mr. Feste!　What is that!
Fish. You saw them at the market earlier. <cf>It's delicious when it's fresh, isn't it?
You are going to eat that! <cf>Well, go to ......!
Hey, you two! <cf>Don't go too far!
Did you see how excited they were, servants of ......? <cf>They are like children seeing the sea for the first time.
By the looks of it, perhaps the ocean in the future will be ......
The future or ....... <cf>It's all suddenly very real. ......
...... Oh, they're back!
Feste, senior. <cf>Thank you very much for today!
This is the first time that we have been in contact with the real sea!
In our time, <cf>the oceans were also contaminated by avaritia ......
In this day and age, there are still <cf>beautiful blue seas left!
...... Do not lose this color. Never.
To leave this blue, I will surely finish the liberation of <cf>avaritia!
Yes, be sure to visit ......!
...... The Future of the Stars, huh?
Hey, I'm a little curious. <cf>Isn't this cathedral very noisy?
Shell[--]No, [mitsuka]i aside, <cf>those monsters in the aisle were ......
...... If it's a question for God's Chosen by the <cf>I'll have to answer it for you.
This cathedral was originally bequeathed by the god of Bapharia.
Long ago, our god fought with the dragon tribe. <cf>There are remnants of this war in these ruins.
If anyone other than the God of Bapharia and his congregation enter, they will be attacked by the 'wrath of God' like that <cf>
Ah!　[The same structure as the Mihashira.
......?　Have you ever been in [Mihashira]?
By the way, there was once a report <cf>that the inside of [Mihashira] was badly vandalized. ......
No, no?　I just heard it from a member of the congregation. <cf>Well, never mind. Keep talking.
...... Anyway, the remains of God have left us with this <cf>mechanism to eliminate our enemies!
But when God's [angel] appeared, <cf>"wrath" was not triggered!
At that time, [Mitsuka] was sleeping quietly, and <cf>there was no need to put up wards[--].
Something must have offended the [mitsuka]. <cf>Suddenly he became very angry and attacked us.
[The wrath of God was also triggered, forcing <cf>us to leave the cathedral, and we were forced to leave.
Einrain-sama was to set up a ward from here to quell the <cf>[messenger(mitsuka)]y!
I see: ......
If you set up warding far from the target, <cf>you will expend extra power on it!
Master Einrain is no exception. <cf>You are more tired than you look!
Even though you guys have made it possible for me to ward by the angel <cf>, I'm sure the buildup has been considerable!
If Einlein falls, we are in trouble. <cf>Can't you do something?
In the meantime, we are asking you to take a special medicine made by the Order to <cf>help alleviate your fatigue.
We are running out of raw materials for that medicine as well. ......
If that's what you're talking about, we're the right people for the job. <cf>We are experts in gathering raw materials, are we not?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Chosen by the God indeed. <cf>Let us be thankful for your hearts of service.
Please ask <cf>for the whereabouts of raw materials, as there is a member of our congregation who is familiar with pharmacology.
He would be watching the <cf>plants and flowers near the temple in Asterleeds!
Mm, then, my servant. We'll head to the temple as soon as possible.
Hey, Lugerio mentioned <cf>that you are the layman who is familiar with pharmacology?
Hey, I'm not going to answer that. Hey!
Shh!　...... I can't hear the grass and flowers anymore!
Yes?
Leaves rustling in the wind...... leaves rubbing against each other...... veins rippling...... <cf>can be heard...... of grass and flowers Dance......
Poemer!
I just ...... tell ...... the breath of the grass and flowers. <cf>I tell ...... the voice of its greenery.
Nah, he has a habit. ......
Yes, all right, let's keep it simple. <cf>Orders from your boss, Lugerio.
We are looking for raw materials to make a special medicine for the Order. <cf>Please tell us what you need.
Medicine...... it saves people...... hope......
(Patience, I'm patient!　(Hang in there!)
What we need now is "Oil of Skyfish" ...... <cf>When oil and honey mix...... the flower of life blooms......
Did you hear that, servant?　You heard me.　Now we're done. <cf>Let's go get some raw materials!
The medicine ...... is a light ...... that brings out the power of ...... people. <cf>Please be careful when using it. ......
I see that you have picked the raw materials. <cf>Thank you.
We humbly accept it. <cf>God bless you all, and God bless Bapharia.
The drug-savvy congregation you mentioned, <cf>, was very habitual ......
I am sorry. <cf>He is an excellent medicine man.
Let's have that one make the medicine as soon as possible. <cf>I'm sure that one has already gathered all the ingredients.
Hm?　Is this not the only material?
We need several other medicinal herbs. <cf>But some of them are poisonous.
He identifies those things and <cf>collects the medicinal herbs he needs all by himself!
You weren't just a poet. ......
Now, please wait here for a moment. <cf>I will bring you your medicine. ......
This is the Order's special medicine. <cf>Please give it to Master Einrain.
I don't mind, but why don't you go give it to them?
I have some business to attend to.
Well ....... Then we'll take this medicine to <cf>Einlein.
Yes, I would like to know if you have any questions or comments. Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Hey, I got your medicine. Can you get some rest?
I rewired it a while ago, so you can rest now: ......
I will take your medicine ...... ......
I know it sounds like a lot of work, but I wish you the best of luck: ......
But now that I'm closer to [Mitsuka], it's a lot easier <cf>than it was before ......
...... By the way, Einrain. <cf>I'm talking about Carvein. ......
...... Shh. Small voice.
The last time I met Carvein in person was at <cf>I was also the last person to see that cartouche ......
You mean "that" or ....... I see, so it doesn't change the fact that you and I met in Khartoum <cf>
Well, if I didn't, I wouldn't have been able to borrow the chronogram from Charlotte <cf>...... mmm ......
Oh, no, it's nothing. <cf>Oh, by the way, have you finished your pilgrimage?
Pilgrimage?　Pilgrimage, not yet. ......
I've been warding here and at the <cf>Salamzart meeting, so ......
A meeting?　I'm sorry, a little more detail there.
Salamzart's meeting: ...... Emergency four-way meeting between Bernhardt, Salamzart, <cf>Asterleeds, and the Order: ......
With the assassination of the Duke, Dunkirk took real power and ...... <cf>He said he would explain the future of the Principality to the nations. ......
Salamzart, which is neutral, and the meeting can be found at ......
...... You've been in touch with <cf>Carvein behind the scenes?
....... <cf>It was dangerous, but he's innocent. ......
...... Mm, yes, I agree. I agree. <cf>Carvein is a very honest and serious man.
...... I can't wait to get you out of your doubt.
We'll help as much as we can. <cf>He saved Charlotte's life.
We will help as much as we can. <cf>And he helped us with Charlotte.
Thank you ....... It's reassuring to hear you say that.
I'll do my best to put up wards. <cf>I'll definitely keep [Mitsuka] at bay here. ......
Yes, that's the spirit! <cf>But don't overdo it, okay?
Yes. ......!
Well, then, we shall return. <cf>We must report to Lugerio.
I've given Einlein some medicine. <cf>Also, I'm getting some rest now.
Thank you very much. <cf>I hope you are well, Mr. Einrain.
Oh, and I'm motivated to do it!
I see. <cf>I'm glad I asked you guys for the medicine after all.
By the way, you said you had some business to attend to, so you Declined to take <cf>with you [--].
...... because I am in charge of scolding Master Einrain.
If I visit you when you are tired, <cf>you will be even more tired!
In times like these, it's better to have people like you guys who can <cf>talk down to us!
...... Consideration for Einlein, I see.
Yes, she is an important oracle priestess.
Good grief, they're all clumsy. ......
Hey, Jake! <cf>How's the coin-operated pavilion coming along?
Let's ask the opposite. Does it look done?
Mm, it looks like he's having a hard time getting a handle on it.
It's just in time to be clear!
Inventorying liquor and food, checking purchase routes, <cf>cleaning, washing dishes, interceding for drunks, ......
No matter how top of the line I am, <cf>this guy is a handful!
I can't even tease you about this. ...... <cf>Anything I can do to help?
<span size="Big">What! Seriously! &lt;/&gt;
The Coin Pavilion is a place of rest and relaxation for adventurers. <cf>I have some attachment to it myself.
I don't want you to get into trouble and <cf>go out of business while your husband is away.
That's what I'm talking about, LIKE. Feste's girl!
Wow, no. I don't want to help at all!
Don't say that. I'd like to ask you to stock up for now. <cf>I'm in urgent need of some things right now.
I want "Salamzart's special spices" and <cf>"Litze Herbs" from the village of Litze.
If you could get these two items from a local merchant <cf>it would be tremendously helpful, would you do it?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Thank you! <cf>I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys can do!
Sorry, it's from the Coin Pavilion. <cf>I am here to pick up Salamzart's special spices!
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I've been worried about you because I haven't heard from you in a while.
Here you go, spices for the month. Take good care of it.
Maybe we'll be a little <cf>less flexible in the future. ......
Bernhardt. <cf>He's been pressuring me a little bit on trade relations.
They've been coming at me pretty hard <cf>to not do business with the cult in particular.
See, Asterleeds has a lot of influence with the Order, doesn't it? <cf>Who knows what will happen in the future?
After the assassination of the Duke and Dunkirk's rise to the top, <cf>they've gone all, well, hardline.
Salamzart is trying to remain neutral, but <cf>I wonder how this will play out: ......
Oops, I'm talking about something dark. <cf>Business should be fun, right? Thanks again!
Sorry, it's from the Coin Pavilion. <cf>I'm here to pick up the Litze Herb!
Oh, you look different. <cf>What happened to your father?
I've been traveling a bit and have been working on ....... <cf>My deputy is running things right now.
Hmm, too bad, I thought I'd be able to see my dad's face <cf>for the first time in a while.
Look, it's Ritche's pride and joy, Ritche Herb. <cf>I've prepared the usual amount for you, so take it with you.
Thank you. Indeed!
...... You guys are adventurers, right? <cf>You've been all over the place, haven't you?
Then, hey, have you heard about the <cf>anomaly in the cult within Bernhardt?
A change in the Order within Bernhardt: ......? <cf>What's that?
No, I just heard about it from a fellow merchant. <cf>Something about everything being suppressed or something. ......
But the spooky thing is that this is not a rumor at all in Asterleeds <cf>
Well, Asterleeds is a free Commercial Town Asterleeds, but <cf>the influence of the Order is strong. Maybe that's part of it.
Do you know anything else about ......?
Yeah, that's right. Oh, there's a story that ...... the knight who assassinated the king, <cf>Carvein, is connected to the Order.
Then isn't it <cf>understandable that Carvein ran over here?
Then the assassination of the Lord King was the work of the cult ....... <cf>[--] Oh, my God!　Well, it's all gossip.
Well then, give my regards to the surrogate husband. <cf>I hope he's a good-looking father.
Great! You brought your purchases in one piece. <cf>Thank you very much!
Now all that's left to do is to prepare this <cf>as per your father's secret recipe [--].
You know, Jake. I haven't paid much <cf>attention to it, but ......
In recent months, <cf>relations between countries have begun to tense ......?
Hmm?　Yeah, ...... international situation is definitely <cf>getting tinier.
(After all, the history we know is different from <cf>......)
Maybe in the future, adventurers will be approached <cf>in terms of armed forces.
In anticipation of this, I'm seeing more and more <cf>rugged guys in Asterleeds.
...... war, huh?
I don't know. I honestly don't know. But [--]
For that reason, I think we must not lose this place <cf>that is a place of relaxation.
You ...... think that much ......
Hu...... well. Besides [--].
If she sees the unexpected side of me running the store like this, <cf>her Heart might Heat up too!
You ...... think like that ......
HAHAHA! There's nothing that top of the line Jake can't <cf>do!　Get the customers and her, man!
In a way, I'm relieved that you haven't changed: ......
Oh, you guys are at ....... <cf>I believe you knew Char, didn't you?
I am the leader of the troupe that employs that girl. Thank you for helping <cf>Char on that occasion!
At times, that ...... you guys are quite close to <cf>Char?
I don't know you personally too well, but <cf>I've helped and been helped a few times!
I see. Let's see: ......
Do you know the whereabouts of that girl at ......?
That's ...... sorry, <cf>for us to know more ......
I see. No, please don't worry about it. <cf>I'm sorry I asked you such a strange question.
Have you heard from Charlotte?
Yeah. Nothing since those weirdos attacked me. <cf>Just leave a note to say you're leaving for a bit: ......
...... that boy always keeps to himself <cf>I'm worried about him!
He must have left us because he was concerned that the group members were <cf>injured because he was targeted!
Is he really safe now? ...... <cf>Are they eating properly? ......
As a substitute parent, I'm already worried and concerned about ...... ugh ......!
Well, I think we'll be fine. <cf>Our acquaintance should be working with us.
What?　What?
As I said before, I don't know where she went, but <cf>Charlotte is with someone she trusts.
So don't worry too much [--].
Well, then maybe <cf>you guys can get in touch with Char or something!
Eh?　Let's see, well, <cf>maybe not even possible ......?
If so, please do me a favor! <cf>Please come and find out how Char is doing!
I know <cf>that she is keeping her distance with us. Then at least let us know how it's going [--].
(You can't be so careless with all this worry. ...... <cf>Can't you at least let us know how you're doing?)
(Ask Einlein, she can at least be reached at <cf>or ......)
I understand. I'll take care of it.
Oh!　Thank you very much! <cf>I'll have to go tell my wife as soon as possible!
A good troupe leader. <cf>They must be a real family troupe.
Then I should at least let him know how things are going.
Let's go to the Sanctuary of Blessings. <cf>We must consult Einlein.
Einrain. <cf>May I ask you a favor?
...... what?
I'm looking for Charlotte. <cf>Is there any way I can get in touch with him?
The head of the troupe that took care of Charlotte was <cf>very worried about him.
I thought I'd at least let you know how I'm doing <cf>and let you know how I'm doing ......
...... if that's what you mean.
Come back in two days. <cf>I'll get your letter. ......
Oh!　I'm asking for it. See you in two days.
And two days later: ......
You said you got a letter from Charlotte!
Give it to the troupe leader. <cf>Charlotte is ...... very worried about you. ......
Oh, I'll take care of it. <cf>I'll make sure it gets there!
All right, servant. Let's hurry to Salamzart!
Thank you for waiting. <cf>Here is a letter from Charlotte.
Oh ......!　Thank you!
You, read quickly!　Voila!
Wait, don't be so hasty. <cf>Let's see. ...... Oh, that's definitely a char.
Uh ...... <cf>&lt;Dear troupe members ......&gt;
&lt;How are you? <cf>I'm sorry for suddenly leaving on this trip.
&lt;I'm sure you're worried about me. ...... <cf>But don't worry. I'm doing very well! &gt;
&lt;I went on the trip because I was happy to see someone I know. <cf>I wanted to spend a little more time with them. ......&gt;
&lt;So, really, don't worry. <cf>I'm having fun.
＜I'll keep traveling a little longer for now, but ...... and <cf>I'll get back to you guys.
&lt;I'll bring lots of souvenirs then. <cf>Let's party together! &gt;
&lt;[--]I'm sorry for being a selfish daughter. <cf> To my beloved family. Charlotte.
Char ......
I'm glad to hear that ...... is doing well. <cf>That's all that matters now: ......
Thank you. <cf>It's a relief to know how that boy is doing.
I guess they don't want us to worry about them. <cf>He's trying so hard to have fun. ......
...... That child has no real parents. <cf>She was originally an abandoned child, came to the troupe when she was 10 or so.
Since then, we've raised her as if she were <cf>our real daughter!
But ...... we also know that he wants to meet his real parents <cf>
I want to make that dream come true somehow. <cf>That boy is just so strong like this. ......
[--]Anyway, I'll leave it to her to decide for now.
Yes, I know. Charles never does anything wrong.
Yeah, we're so proud of her.
Thank you so much for this time. <cf>It's not much, but please accept our thanks!
Now, we will leave you with this. <cf>We would like to show the letter to the others. ......
A good family, even if they're not blood related.
...... family, or ......
We, whose memories are not so clear, are far away from it. <cf>Well, it can't be helped!
Hey! You look kind of bored, don't you? <cf>No, I must be bored. Right?
What's with the heavy-handedness? <cf>Is there something you want me to help you with?
I'm having a bit of a problem.
This is the trouble I have with the <cf>top of the top adventurers in Asterleeds. ......
Ah yes, yes. <cf>Enough with the smugness, and get on with it.
In conclusion, <cf>I'd like you to take my request off my shoulders.
Due to the fact that I'm currently away from here, <cf>I'm reducing the number of requests from the Bureau of Reclamation ......
I was asked by a client who didn't know that <cf>"I had to have Jake.
It's all because of my talent. <cf>Oh, I hate my talent. ......
[So, I'd like you to <cf>Accept my request on my behalf.
If it's a junior I'm looking at, <cf>I'm sure the client would agree.
...... Well, if that's what you mean.
If it's addressed to you, I'm sure the fee will be reasonable. <cf>I'd also like to thank you for taking care of this place.
Thank you! <cf>Okay, I'll give you a brief description of the request.
My client is Priest Walken of Minsterhorn.
That noisy priest? <cf>Has he gone missing again?
You're not far off the mark. <cf>The one who went missing, though, was his apprentice, Millene.
Millene ....... <cf>Yeah, I'm pretty sure there was a female apprentice who wore glasses. That one.
Do you know?　Then we can talk quickly!
The apprentice has not returned from his search for "Dragon Claw Valley" <cf>for 6 more days!
["]I'll be back in a couple of days[,]"] he said, so <cf>Priest Walken was indeed worried.
The master was missing before, and now the apprentice. <cf>We are like master and disciple. ......
Most likely, like his mentor, his curiosity got the better of him and he <cf>can't see what's going on around him.
I am personally indebted to Priest Walken. <cf>I would like to ask you to do one thing for me!
Good, you asked. <cf>We are no strangers to priests.
Now, my servant, let us go in search of Millene!
Is this the back where Millene was said to have disappeared: ......
......?　Servant. <cf>Didn't you hear something just now?
Am I mistaken?　However [--]
It's not a mistake. Something is happening! <cf>Hurry, servant!
Servant, do you recognize these broken glasses?
I believe these glasses are from ......
--!
...... Mm, it must be Millene's. <cf>And ...... there are traces of blood around it.
Then she's ...... no way ......
Emotionally, I want him to live, but <cf>it will be difficult under the circumstances ......
Such as ......
......, this kind of thing happens in the adventuring business.
I'm going back to the coin pavilion with the glasses. <cf>I'll have to report back to Jake. ......
...... I see. <cf>The sound of the wind through the gap.
I thought it was a scream or something. <cr>What a clown!
Hey! <cf>Did you find Millene?
...... if only for the broken glasses.
Is that ......
...... Oh, I see. That's what I meant, huh?
Sorry, I'm sorry I turned in a bad request. <cf>I'll explain it to the priest.
Sorry, man.
If Feste's missus is sissy, <cf>don't let her get out of tune.
Just ...... sorry, but I need you to elaborate on the situation. <cf>I have to report to the Pioneer Bureau.
Oh, yes. First of all, [--]
Excuse me!　Jake, are you there?
Huh?
Oh?
Oh ......!
I guess the doctor got impatient and asked him to search for me. <cf>I'm really sorry!
<span size="Big">You're aliveーーー! &lt;/&gt;
What?　Yeah, I'm alive, but? <cf>I'm fine today, and I've had a good breakfast, though?
That's good to hear, why not ......! <cf>My lord, these are broken glasses!　In the ruins!
Oh, you guys picked it up? <cf>Thank you!　But I made a new one.
Is that the new ......?
I'm sorry. Well, this time I was really overwhelmed. <cf>I fell and broke my glasses in the ruins.
Do you understand the feeling of despair when a nearsighted person loses his glasses? <cf>And then, a hard blow on the face would cause a nosebleed. It was really painful.
So I asked a passing adventurer to bring me to <cf>Asterleeds.
But you can't do anything without your glasses, right? <cf>That's why I stayed cooped up until I could get new ones.
Uh, ......, and in the meantime, a priest who was worried about not hearing from you sent a request to <cf>me.
It seems so. I am so sorry. <cf>I'm having trouble worrying about the doctor too!
Haha ...... glad you're ok, but <cf>you can't speak for Walken!
If you don't want to worry, <cf>don't go exploring alone from now on.
Do you know how we felt when we found these broken glasses at <cf>?　Hmm?
U...... right. And as a result, I'm wasting my time. <cf>I'm sorry ...... I should have contacted you first ......
From now on, I will try not to go exploring alone. <cf>...... as much as possible, you know.
From the looks of it, you don't want to stop exploring <cf>on your own, do you?
Naturally!　We won't stop until we solve the mystery of the super-ancient civilization <cf>!
Is it a super-ancient civilization? ...... <cf>Is it different from the Bapharia civilization?
That's a very ancient civilization. ...... <cf>Is it different from the Bapharia civilization?
<span size="Big">I'm glad you asked! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, what's this, <cf>I feel like I just hit a switch I don't need?
Do you know what a stratum is?　Strata. It's an essential part of doing history <cf>. The higher up they are, the newer they are, the lower they are.
That means it's about 15,000 years older than the Bapharia site. <cf>
There are traces of a civilization that was And it was a super advanced civilization that was far more developed <cf>than it is today, or rather, it was so super advanced that we don't even understand it!
There were traces. Yes, for example, these glasses!　Isn't it amazing that this same shape <cf>has been found in that stratum!
Well, it seems that the very ancient ones were more sophisticated. <cf>Especially the lens, which seems to have had a lot of ingenuity in it.
Hey ...... how long is this going to last ......?
Walken and ...... are about the same ......
Oh ...... yeah ...... I see that ......
Hey, are you listening?　So, the lens... <cf>Apparently, there's a device that allows the image to float directly on the lens.
Wow, that's great.
Wow, that's great.
What are you taking seriously? <cf>If you continue like this, there will be further explanations [--].
Right?　Isn't it amazing?　So, this super-ancient civilization <cf>had a system where everything worked automatically.
I'll take care of the rest. <cf>Goodbye!
Don't run away!　Take me with you! <cf>No, please take me with you, Master Jake!
Don't wear the "sir" sign only when you're in a situation like this!　I'm running away!
So, so, so [--]!
<span size="Big">Please help me! &lt;/&gt;
You, you want to go kill a demi-dragon?
The one about being out in Asteria Plain. <cf>I'll pass. I can't. I can't. Are you going?
I'll pass too. I can't. I can't. I can't. <cf>I hear a lot of people are getting turned around.
I guess. No matter how big the success fee is, <cf>life is more important.
These requests should be left to the good guys. <cf>...... See, if you talk about it.
Oh, that's the rumored ......!
What is it? <cf>They are glancing at us.
Well, I can understand why you might be tempted to look at them. <cf>There are not many girls as beautiful as I am.
I'm glad I'm a beautiful girl with a big heart <cf>who also forgives impudent glances. Hohoho!
Those two guys said demi-dragons or something like that.
Those two guys were talking about demi-dragons or something like that.
Well, you said the rewards are pretty good. <cf>What do you think?　Would you like to go and test your skills as well?
Word of you is spreading nicely, isn't it? <cf>Let's make a name for ourselves again here and give it a boost!
The more famous you become, the easier it might be to get <cf>clues to your memory.
Once that's decided, let's get moving! <cf>Let's go kill the demi-dragons!
Excuse me. I heard <cf>that there will be a demi-dragon in this area ......
Are you here to beat me, by any chance? <cf>Well, then I'm sorry to hear that.
The demi-dragons have already been defeated. <cf>...... we were just watching too.
What?　Was there someone very strong?
Strong ...... or rather ...... <cf>I wonder what that was all about?
...... mmm. It's like I was dreaming or something.
Let's see, ......? <cf>I'd like to know more about it if possible.
It was a boy who defeated a demi-dragon. <cf>Suddenly it flew out of the sky [--].
It was so easy while we were standing there. <cf>What kind of magic did they use?
...... What kind of boy was he?
She was beautiful. <cf>But I guess it's ...... a little scary or ......
As soon as they saw us, they said ["]no qualities[,]" and <cf>immediately flew away!
I wonder what kind of Imagine Seed that thing uses. <cf>I can't believe it can fly: ......
...... servant. What is a boy if ......
......Merlouf
Um, do you know where the child went? <cf>Just the direction.
Then it's in that direction. <cf>I can't guarantee we'll see each other, though.
All right. Let's go after them, servant!
I found it!　You're the one who killed the demi-dragon. <cf>You're stealing our reward!
That's a terrible thing to say as soon as we met. <cf>I didn't beat you for the reward.
Then why not?
...... because everyone was in trouble?
Wow - that sounds like a great lie. <cf>If you're going to lie, you'd better tell a decent lie!
That's disturbing. I'm not lying, though. <cf>It's my role to help people.
...... Well, okay. We met here 100 years ago. <cf>Let me tell you who you are!
I agree. <cf>I'd be happy to talk to you, but I'd like ...... compensation.
Consideration?　Or money?
Your thought process of tying everything to money is <cf>I don't hate it, but it's not the right answer.
The price I'm asking for is [--][strength].
Strength ......?
Yes, I do. I'm a sucker for strong people. <cf>Show me your strength and I'll answer your questions.
Suddenly I'm being asked to show strength. ...... <cf>Do you want to do pushups here?　Mainly the servants.
That would be interesting, but I'd like to see the real battle anyway.
For now, [--]yes. <cf>I'm going to need you to try to take down "Pink Uribo."
What?　You want us to fight for nothing <cf>to find out who you are?
I'm not forcing you to do anything, okay?　You can Decline. <cf>But in that case [--]
Simply because I think you guys were 'up to it' <cf>, you know?
Hohoho ...... you are trying to provoke me? <cf>Interesting. I'm in.
Go, my servant!　Let the strength of you and of me be a reminder to <cf>this cheeky little fellow!
Ha ha. I have high hopes for you. Good luck.
Well, I've beaten him, just as you ordered!
...... Really?
Hmm?　I'm sorry you doubt me.
Really, is that your power?　It can't be. ...... <cf>Do you need to be a little more critical ......?
What are you mumbling about? <cf>Anyway, you have my word. You will tell me who you are.
No.
I told you.　Show me your strength and I will answer your questions. <cf>I have yet to see your strength.
If you want to hear the answer, <cf>you'll have to defeat "Iron Fang" next.
What the hell?　You fraud!
Whatever you say, if it doesn't match what I want <cf>I won't answer your question.
Unnnnnnnnnn. ......!
[--]Yeah!　You can't end up looking like a fool! <cf>Let's do it, servant!
How about this, are you ready to talk?
...... why
Yeah? - Yeah.　What now?
You're not letting your power get the better of you, are you? <cf>You've got to show more of your value.
Value ......?
You need to make more use of Imagine. <cf>You can do it, can't you?
That being said: ......
If it's just strength, I don't care if he's just some adventurer.
But you are not. <cf>That's why I'm facing you guys like this.
If you don't understand that, then I guess my help ends here.
What ......!
...... Look again.
...... I want you to look at it again.
...... is fine. However, this is the last time. <cf>Take down the "Trick Elder."
Well, I'm kind of going off on my own, but <cf>if you say you're going to do it, I don't blame you.
This time we're going to show the crappy kid <cf>how strong we are!
How about ...... this time?
......Well, I guess I'd say it's up to par. <cf>I wouldn't say it demonstrates your value.
Oh, oh, oh!　We did it, my servant!
Okay?　Your real power is not like this. <cf>You need to utilize more of your Imagine.
Listen to the voices of Imagineers. <cf>Not as tools, but as friends who fight together. ......
Fellowship?
That's right. Imagine Seeds are crystals of will. <cf>It contains the thoughts and feelings of people.
You, more than most, should be able to feel those feelings. <cf>Because that's the kind of person you are.
I don't understand. ......
Yeah, I guess it's still a little early.
By the way, I promise!　If you get a good score, it means that <cf>you've met your criteria. Answer our questions!
Right. <cf>Okay, one thing about who I am.
I am not chronoleptic. <cf>I am the same person in the present and in the future that you have met.
Hoho ......?
...... No, wait. So you mean you'll still be <cf>alive in that form a thousand years from now ......?
A beautiful boy forever, I guess.
Oh, my!　Don't take my sales away!
No, no, that's not the question. <cf>Are you subhuman?　My lifespan is [--].
Well, I'll see you later.
Oh!　Holy shit, wait. Don't fly away! <cf>Don't wait for me!
[--]Gnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...! <cf>You've only deepened the mystery!
...... Voice of Imagineers, huh?
Enough of the qualities of a hero.
But whether it will blossom or not is an unknown area ...... <cf>
...... Hey, Adelaide. <cf>What do you think ......?
Mr. Aerinse, I think it's time for you to get ready to leave.
...... I know, right? I have to go to "Pillar of Divinity" as soon as possible.
I'm sure you have something to say.
I can't keep secrets from you.
I wanted to see ...... the sea ....... <cf>At least a glimpse before returning to the original time.
I'm sorry. Now is not the time to be so <cf>leisurely.
Senpai, I also ask you. <cf>[Please let me go to the sea before I go to Mihashira.
Tyris?　Are you sure?
I wanted to see the ocean too. <cf>I wanted to see the richness of the sea in this time period in my eyes. ......
If that's the case, Asterleeds is a good choice. <cf>The beach there is a tourist attraction.
Yes!　And while we're at it, let's get hungry. <cf>Salamzart's food is too spicy for me.
Thank you very much. <cf>...... really, thank you!
The sea in Asterleeds is a first class tourist attraction. <cf>It is always beautiful!
Yes, it is. It's very beautiful.
The sky and the sea are really beautiful ...... ......
Well, let's get started, shall we?
I and my servant will get you something suitable. <cf>You guys wait here.
No, if that's what you want, I'll [--].
Good, good, good. I'm the one who knows best about the delicacies of Asterleeds <cf>
Let's go, my servant. <cf>Our destination is the Coin Pavilion.
Delicious food takeout for 4!　Hurry!
Yes. So, is this another bill?
I will pay you.
No, not you. I'll pay this time.
[--]!　Phantom hearing ......!
Are you okay?　Did you eat something bad? <cf>Or did you hit your head?　Are you still dreaming?
What is it with you two? <cf>I don't eat out all year round either!
Well, besides, I have something else to ask you this time.
What, is there something else besides food?
Ummm ...... can you lend me an ear for a minute?
...... is actually ......, but it's now ............. <cf>Probably ...... at ......
Can't you do something with your contacts at ...... beach at ......?
...... I see. In that case, you're welcome. <cf>I'll have food ready for you soon, so just eat it and wait for me on the beach.
Hey, nice to meet you, man.
It's a secret, even from you. Well, look forward to it.
Now, after receiving our food, we'll head back to the beach!
How are you enjoying the sea?
Yes, thanks to you.
I'm glad to hear that. <cf>Here, I bought you some food. Go ahead, eat.
Thank you. Well, it looks delicious ......!
Dear Mr. Aerinse, please take a hand towel.
Thanks. I'm thrilled to have food outside looking at the ocean for the first time <cf>
Hmm, me too.
Even Tyris is in a box. ...... <cf>I guess a nobleman's attendant is also a nobleman.
...... boxed. Yes.
I thought I knew <cf>about this planet just from knowledge!
The world of this era that I actually saw was so big and <cf>so colorful and had so many different smells and ......
Well, I was bothered by the [light-colored winds]. <cf>But that's why--
Now I can truly understand Mr. Aerinse's desire to protect this planet <cf>
I, too, want to protect this planet. I want to protect the people who live on this planet.
...... For that, <cf>you'll have to go back to the future by all means.
I've met you both, <cf>and I've come to believe that.
I have a strong desire to protect <cf>because of the future that ...... Feste and his seniors are building!
Tyris is right.
After landing here and meeting many people, <cf>my feelings have become stronger. But ......
If I could, I would have been ...... nothing, but in this time, <cf>I wanted to be born with you ......
Hey, look at that!
Fireworks. ......!
I don't know whose whim it was, but the timing is perfect. <cf>Let's watch the fireworks for a while.
...... Oh!
(I was asking my husband to do that at ......!)
...... isn't this a bit of a surprise?
...... clean
It's like a ...... dream with the fireworks reflected in the sea. ......
...... I will never forget <cf>this sight I saw with my seniors!
No matter what, never ......
Aerinse. I need to talk to you about something I'm about to do.
Aerinse. I need to talk to you about something I'm about to do.
Aerinse?　Can you hear me?
............Tyris......
Holy cow, Aerinse!
Ya!
What is it?　Don't be so surprised! <cf>I'm surprised at you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just thinking about something.
...... hmm?
...... I just heard a metallic sound. <cf>Did you drop something?
What, ......?　Ah!　Omnistron is missing! <cf>Oh no, what should I do?
Calm down! <cf>You'll never find what you're looking for if you're in a hurry.
And, but...
Oh, look, at your feet: ......
Underfoot?　Ah[--]
............
<span size="Big">I stepped on itーーー! &lt;/&gt;
What should I do? <cf>What's that popping sound?　A popping sound!
Oh, oh, oh, calm down!　Look carefully! <cf>It is not yet decided that it is broken!
Yes, you're right. <cf>I'll have to check to make sure it's activated properly: ......
Now I'll start ......
How about ......?
It looks like ...... no good. <cf>I mean, no. ......
Oh no. ....... <cf>What am I supposed to do without Tyris? ......
Once back to the future? <cf>But it's not so easy to chronoleap [--].
...... I'll fix it for you.
Huh?　Can you do it?
In a nutshell. Before coming to this time, <cf>I learned repair procedures with Tyris
Even if you were to be alone, you could still manage to get ...... and
Tyris said that he wouldn't let that happen, even if ["]even if ["]he did."] <cf>
Oh. ......
Oh, was it at that time? <cf>I was amused and tried to put my hand out [--].
Tyris said ["[Aerinse-sama must not do any repairs ["] <cf>and cared for my hand ......
...... so Tyris always did a lot of <cf>things for me. I just watch it
Yes, it is. Even when we decided to come to this time period, <cf>it was Tyris who made sure everything was ready!
I'm <cf>just saying what I want to do ......
Well, don't be so hard on yourself. <cf>You are of noble birth. It can't be helped.
...... but that's not good enough anymore. <cf>Now I have to do it!
Sorry, can you help us collect parts for repair <cf>?
I'd like to say this one myself ......, but <cf>I'm not sure I'm comfortable with just one as I'm sure you are.
Thank you very much! <cf>Now let's get started looking for parts as soon as possible!
You can get the parts you need from "Pridok" here <cf>, right?
Yes, I will. I'm looking forward to working with you, sir.
I don't have the strength to fight, but <cf>I will support you as much as I can.
Expectations.
Yes, I am!　Well, let's go!
You got the parts safely. <cf>Aerinse, you did a great job.
Thank you very much. <cf>But I have to work hard from now on.
Let's go back to the temple in Asterleeds. <cf>There, we can calmly make repairs.
We will now move on to the repair of the Omnistron. <cf>I will take a few moments of your time.
Oh, I leave the rest to you. <cf>Do your best!
Yes, I will fix it. I will fix it, I promise.
I said ......, but is it safe? <cf>[I wonder if you can repair the machine.
Let's wait and believe. It's going to be okay.
Let's wait and believe. It will be all right.
You are positive. <cf>Well, it's also true that you are saved by it.
Thank you for your patience. <cf>Your Omnistron is ready for repair!
Oh, you did it!
It was confusing at first, but once I figured out how <cf>it worked,[--] there you go!
Oh - it really is fixed. ......
That's great, Aerinse.
That's great, Aerinse.
Thank you very much. <cf>Actually, I made a few modifications as well!
Hmm?　Alteration?
Yeah. Like this [--]
<span size="Big">It's hugeooooo! &lt;/&gt;
What do you think? <cf>Don't you think the text is easier to read this way?
No, you see too much!
Bachelard has been a bit senile lately, so I thought <cf>a feature like this would be helpful!
Ummmmm, kindness! <cf>But that kindness, I don't need it now!
Later, there are other features such as [--].
Let's get it back on track.
...... yes
I'm sorry you didn't like it. ...... <cf>I can't help it. I'll go put it back on. ......
...... I heard that Tyris said that ["]Mr. Aerinse told you that <cf>you must not do any repairs["].
Aerinse seemed to think that Tyris was <cf>looking out for her.
Tyris must have seen through Aerinse's 'talent' and said so <cf>......
Listen to me! <cf>I've come up with a better remodeling idea!
<span size="Big">Dismissed... ！！！！ &lt;/&gt;
......?　The priests seem to be on edge.
Oh, isn't that Aerinse over there? <cf>She looks serious. ......
According to the information that just came in, <cf>it seems that we have succeeded in driving the ale!
Well, thank goodness. ...... <cf>That's a relief for a start.
Your advice was correct. <cf>On behalf of the priests present here, I thank you.
No, it's because you all listened to what I had to say <cf>
But we must not let our guard down yet. <cf>I think it's only a matter of time before they stay quiet.
Yes, that's right. We need to take the next step as soon as possible. ......
What's going on? <cf>There's an atmosphere of excitement here.
Oh, no. ......
Don't worry. <cf>These people know what's going on, so don't worry.
If I tell you the whole story, <cf>Mr. Lugerio will not be blamed for it.
If Mr. Aerinse says so, then you can find it at ......
...... In fact, <cf>avaritia has escaped from one of the sacred sites!
What the heck! <cf>That's a pretty big problem, isn't it?
Yes, I know. So please keep your voice low ......
Mugg. ......!　I'm sorry. You're right. <cf>The general public has no idea that there is an avaritia in the Holy Land.
Thanks to the efforts of the Order, we were just able to drive to <cf>"Thieves' Falls Behind the Falls".
Aerinse's advice was a good one. <cf>He told us the movement of the thing as if it were an oracle.
(...... You used Omnistron, didn't you?)
(We have not been seen using it, so please visit ......)
Master Lugerio has been working hard to rebuild the Order, <cf>and asked me to lead the charge. ......
I am embarrassed to say that I was just going right and left. <cf>Thank God Mr. Aerinse offered to help me.
I see. <cf>So, what are you going to do with the avaritia you've driven into the ground?
Mr. Lugerio has told me, "If they do any harm, get rid of them." <cf>
It would be difficult for the current Order. <cf>I think they must have been very tired after the incident with the principality.
......That's a sore spot. You are absolutely right, sir.
I think the best move we can make now is to just seal the "Thieves' Falls" <cf> Thieves' Falls" ......
Um, just a suggestion, ......, <cf>Can we pull the congregation once?
Huh?　Yeah. <cf>It's easy to get them to pull it, but what about ...... beyond that?
We want you to leave it to us. <cf>We will take care of Avaritia.
No, no, no, that is too dangerous! <cf>Three people are not enough to deal with that thing!
Oh, you haven't heard of us? <cf>A single avaritia is no small feat, is it?
Shhh, but ......
But our power is a mystery. <cf>The more money we ask for, the more power we have. ......
It's okay. I'll take care of it.
...... Yes, that's right. <cf>You are those whom the God of Bapharia has approved.
Then it must be a blessing from the gods of <cf>Bapharia that you are here now!
I will leave it to you to take care of that thing. <cf>However, please do not take it too hard.
Thank you very much. <cf>I will do my best to bring you good news.
It's back here. <cf>The place where you drove Avaritia into the ground.
It seems that all of the cult members have pulled out. <cf>This should not be a problem for Aerinse to use her power.
I am sorry. <cf>I'm sorry I got you all into this.
I felt like just being in the ...... temple wasn't helping <cf>
So, I thought I'd do what I can to help. <cf>......
It's just the way things are. Besides, [--]
The Order will pay you handsomely for your work! <cf>After all, it's an avaritia deal. Ho-ho-ho!
Now, each of you, brace yourselves. <cf>Let's go all the way to the back!
I've successfully liberated the avalitaire, but ...... <cf>are you okay, my dear?
...... yeah, no problem
Really? <cf>You seem paler than ever. ......
I hope you don't mind. <cf>I'm just a little tired.
Now, let's go back to the temple. <cf>The members of the Order are waiting for your report.
Mm ......
Don't worry. Avaritia is down. <cf>Please turn to the congregation later for confirmation.
Oh ......!　Thank you! <cf>Aerinse has helped me a lot!
If you want to thank me, you can thank these people. <cf>I was just watching. ......
Now let me thank you all again at ....... <cf>Thank you very much for your support!
We will never forget this debt of gratitude. <cf>May God bless you all in Bapharia.
Now, I have to give my report to Mr. Lugerio. <cf>I am sorry, but I must leave you now.
And that settles it...
How about we have a little launch now? <cf>I'm too hungry to fight.
Yeah? - Yeah.　What's up, Aerinse?
Oh, ...... no, I'm ......, but I'm not very hungry. <cf>I'm not very hungry.
I'm sorry. I'm going to take a break first. <cf>See you at ......
Wait, Aerinse.
Wait, Aerinse.
Ouch!
Hey, what is it?　What's the matter?
Hands ...... away from ......!
...... I knew it, you're hurt.
What!　Which one, let me see!
...... Oh, you twisted your wrist. <cf>It's already starting to swell.
You did this earlier in the battle, didn't you? <cf>Why don't you tell me right away?
I just missed the timing to tell you ....... <cf>I can handle this level by myself once my body recovers.
In the first place, the release of the Abaritia <cf>would be a burden on your body, wouldn't it?
Then there is no need to strain yourself otherwise. <cf>You should take better care of yourself.
......We want to be of service to you. <cf>For that reason, a few injuries [--].
If you get hurt, <cf>I can't face Tyris, you know!
Sorry about ....... I'll be careful in the future.
...... Do you really understand? <cf>Too much self-sacrifice can bring bad luck.
Well, that's all right. Let's get you fixed up first. <cf>We'll launch after that.
Yes ......
That's my master! <cf>I can't believe you show up when I'm in distress!
I'm here too. <cf>What's the matter?
That ...... King Norbert has ordered me to sort out what's left <cf>at the Drava Royal Research Institute.
I've already retrieved most of the research materials, but I still haven't gotten to the personal effects of Master Dunkirk over at <cf>
...... and the Bapharia Gods Tribe, <cf>and it's not good for anyone else to know about it. ......
I see. <cf>If that is the case, who else but you would be qualified for the job.
I agree. But ......
I know it's shameful, but I'm afraid to go to that place alone.
I still don't have a <cf>real sense that I have the blood of the divine race in me. No, I don't even believe it.
And yet, I wonder if there is enough evidence there <cf>for that Master Dunkirk to believe so. ......
I know I am being naive. <cf>But I'm ......
Come with me, Carvein. <cf>Everyone's afraid to be alone.
Come with me, Carvein. <cf>Everyone's afraid of being alone.
Master ......!
Scared of being alone, or so ...... says ......
Well, if we know what's going on, we can go with him. <cf>Husband ...... Oh, no, the king won't blame us.
Thank you, Master and Master Lord!
However, you'll have to pay the client's fee, okay? <cf>Plus a special service charge.
Oh!　Don't worry, I'll drop it in the expense account!
You're getting tougher on these things <cf>You're getting tougher ......
Well, thank you very much for your time. <cf>Let's head over as soon as you are ready!
We use this entrance <cf>It's a shortcut to where we want to go.
Just be aware that a malfunctioning prototype weapon is said to have been left unattended at <cf>
You know, with us and you, <cf>there's nothing to be afraid of!
Thanks to the masters, we were able to safely recover Master Dunkirk's personal belongings at <cf>. Thank you very much.
Mm. Let's see what's in that box right away!
Yes, ....... <cf>Let's go somewhere a little more secluded.
Around here, you won't be seen by anyone.
...... Let's open the box!
Yes, I have to confront what's in this. I have to confront what's in here.
Okay, I'll [--] open it.
...... photo? Who is this woman?
She is the wife of Mr. Dunkirk. Isn't she beautiful? <cf>I heard she passed away when York was very young.
There's also a picture of York as a child. <cf>And [--]this one: ......
It's the notebook I sent Master Dunkirk for his birthday. <cf>He used it until it was such a wreck. ......
The only thing that could be called a record is that notebook. <cf>You might want to read .......
...... apparently used it as a diary. <cf>Wow, there's even some notes on the Knights' work ethic.
You've also written down the day's movements of the Prince and the Prince's son. <cf>As one would expect from a father and son. Your handwriting is as meticulous as York's.
Oh, the goodies from Veronica that you got on this day, <cf>were they delicious? Huh, I see. ......
...... The letters are disorganized from here. 'I killed York'. <cf>The rest is mostly bludgeoning ...... and only partially ......
"Pseudo-avaritia," "The King is at the mercy of the Institute," <cf>"The Order," "Collecting Engrams," "Bapharia's Divine Tribe."
'Old Records', 'To the Dragon Tribe', 'Meet the Dragon Tribe by the message of xxx' <cf>...... Who is xxx?
...... This is one day before the assassination of the Duke? <cf>The Dagger, Decipherment Results, ......
Adelaide, the proud warrior of the divine tribe of Bapharia. <cf>Never forget his precious blood, and be a martyr to his mission.
......Adelaide is ...... mother?
...... are you okay?　Can you read ahead?
Oh, oh, ....... <cf>'Carvein is' ...... 'The Blood of the Bapharia Gods'
'No', 'Unforgivable', 'Hateful', 'My son' <cf>'Why', 'You're not bad' ......
No." "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please die. <cf>"I'll be there when I've done everything." ......
My ...... mother is a normal person. She was strong, sure, but <cf>a warrior of the Bapharia god race is such a ......
Who told this lie to Master Dunkirk? Who told this lie to Master Dunkirk? <cf>The results of the decipherment must be a fabrication.
Carvein......
That dragon tribe ...... Leanbluhm, that's him. <cf>He was going to cheat Master Dunkirk from the start.
Who brought the dragon tribe and Master Dunkirk together in the first place? <cf>There is no such thing as a Bapharia divine tribe[--]!
<span size="Big">Carvein! &lt;/&gt;
...... Bapharia Gods Tribe exists. In fact, we have met them. <cf>They are not so different from human beings.
<span size="Big">Don't lie to me! &lt;/&gt;
...... It's not a lie. It's true, Carvein.
...... It's not a lie. It's true, Carvein.
Even the master is ....... <cf>So, my mom is ...... the god tribe is ...... really ......?
Oh ...... something fell out of my pocketbook.
...... This photo is from
Dear Mr. ...... Dunkirk, York, and Veronica. <cf>We are sorry. We are sorry. Sorry ......
My blood is ...... without me! <cf>Mom, why ......!
...... Someday, you may reveal the mystery of your mother with your own hands. <cf>Surely that will be a gift.
<span size="Big">U...... ughhhh ......! &lt;/&gt;
The boundaries are also stable and ...... <cf>no longer in danger, then ...... is a good idea, right?
No, there is always a "just in case". Besides, <cf>Bernhardt Parish is in the middle of a rebuilding ......
...... Oh. Then [--]
I'll ask those people to escort you. So, what do you think?
Yes?　What, all of a sudden?
When did you guys get here?
Because I'm pretty sure those guys would have .......
...... If He's God-approved, I don't blame you!
Um, I don't see what you're talking about. ......?
Master Einrain has some business for Master Carvein. <cf>So I was wondering if you could escort him to Bernhardt Castle.
You have a good face for the principality, and there are no better people to entrust <cf>the oracle priestess to!
Of course, we will pay your request fee. <cf>How about it?
Well, if that's what you mean: ......?
Thank you ....... Best regards, please.
Anyway, if we can get him to Carvein, <cf>we're good, right?　Easy peasy. Let's go, servant!
Einrain to the masters!　What's going on?
...... because I'm ready.
[--]Oh, okay. So. <cf>Let's go then.
Yeah ......
Wait a minute. Don't have a conversation that only you can understand. <cf>You don't have any explanation for us who have escorted you this far?
Because the flowers we've been waiting for, have bloomed. ......
So I made potpourri.
pot-pourri
I thought I'd give ......
To Carvein?
...... in York.
York's favorite flower bloomed, so I made a potpourri of it and brought it with me. <cf>Let's take it with us to visit the grave, that's the idea.
<span size="Big">You can finish explaining in one breath! &lt;/&gt;
...... talk a lot, I'm not good at it.
Sorry. Einlein has always been like this.
If ...... York was around, <cf>he would have followed up better than I did.
But visiting York's grave? <cf>We have never met. ......
Can I accompany you? <cf>I have an Einlein escort. ......
Do you mind if I accompany you? <cf>I have an Einlein escort: ......
Of course!　And I'd like to introduce my mentor to York. <cf>All right, Einrain?
Yeah ...... thanks ......
Okay, it's settled. Let's all go visit York's grave.
Oh, there might be monsters out there, so <cf>masters, be prepared!
Isn't the tomb near the castle?
At Master Dunkirk's request, we built it a short distance away from the castle ...... <cf>in a place that York liked.
Where the three of us used to hang out: ......
Master, here is York's grave.
Ahhhh, ......! <cf>There, the bugs are like that!
Ah, I knew there was an outbreak of bugs. ...... <cf>There's a lot of them around here.
York, even though I hate bugs: ......
Excuse me, Master. <cf>Before you visit the grave, please help us kill the bugs.
Einlein, potpourri at York's grave.
This potpourri is an insect repellent. When the flowers are in bloom, <cf>York makes it himself and wears it ......
You made it for me and Einlein.
Yeah ...... we're fine with bugs.
...... must have been a good friend of yours.
I was the first one to find this place ....... <cf>I felt suffocated being in the temple, so I ran away and ......
York, who came looking for me, also liked the view here <cf>and ......
After Carvein and I became friends, ...... <cf>became a secret place for the three of us.
I was mainly a bug killer when I came here.
...... Here, the three of us talked a lot. <cf>What you like, your dreams for the future, and also your complaints.
But ...... we're down to two ......
...... Hey, Einrain. It's hard to hold the memories of the three of us together <cf>alone, but [--].
...... two people can handle it?
If we remember York, <cf>York won't be gone. That's how I see it.
......
...... It's a relief to have someone to share memories with. <cf>Some wounds are healed by talking to each other.
Hey, if you and I ever get <cf>separated [--]
Will you remember me like the two of you ......?
Oh?　Isn't that Carvein there?
Master and Master Lord! <cf>I never thought I'd see you here. ......
What did you do that you shouldn't be seen doing? <cf>You're the hero who saved the country from a crisis.
'Hero'. I guess I don't want to hear that word right now. ......
......?　What's up?
......?　What's up?
What is it? Your face is so dull.
Why are you in Kanaloa in the first place? <cf>I thought you were in the castle.
Well, ......, frankly, I'm skipping out.
Skipping out!　The strange, earnest you!
...... The Lord Dunkirk one made <cf>me a made 'hero'!
I understand that to fit a lot of things in, <cf>there's no way to do it, but ......
Being made a 'hero' has made it so I can't <cf>casually go out in the field like I used to.
Every day that comes and goes is full of paperwork and ceremonies. <cf>That's important, too, but [--].
I just don't feel like it's something I should be doing. <cf>I'm still a novice, and I'm not the right person to be above people, and I'm not the right person.
Then ...... something suddenly made it hard to breathe and ......
I found myself forced to flee to Kanaloa <cf>under the guise of an inspection ......
Ah ...... you are not adapted to the current environment. <cf>You are more suited to manual labor than to the use of your head.
I can't let Einlein see me looking this pathetic <cf>and ......
York is not there and ......
Master ...... what am I supposed to do ......
He is visibly weak. It looks like a wilted nappo. <cf>I don't know what to do. ......
...... Accept the request with me?
...... Accept a request together?
Oh, isn't it good? <cf>It's good to get moving for a change.
[Yes, that's right. I have just the place I want to go. <cf>Accept it as a request from me.
The King of Kings will only end up laughing at <cf>if you mention our names. See?
Well, if that's the case, by all means! <cf>Please let me join you!
Okay, it's decided. <cf>Now let's go treasure hunting!
(Yeah, it's still a treasure hunt. ......)
The target is the "Burial Objects of the Ancient Kings"! <cf>The destination is the Candlemere Tomb!
How's that for a change?
Yes, I did!　Thanks to you I had a great time!
Oh, yeah, yeah. <cf>We had a lot of fun getting our hands on the treasure!
Master and his Lord, thank you so much for today. <cf>I'm about to head back to the castle.
Oh, wait a minute. Can't you hang out with me a little longer? <cf>Preferably to Kanaloa's.
Is the store ......?
Hmmm. The merchant who wants this treasure is a <cf>fan of yours. I want you to sign it for him.
Oh, if it's that much, it's a small price to pay!
I see. Let's get back to Kanaloa early then. <cf>Hmmm... ...... Hmmm... ......
(I'm plotting ...... absolutely plotting something ......)
After all, can we afford to pay more?
I'm sorry. I'd like to help you, but we're in business too.
[--] Hmm?　It's Mr. Feste, isn't it? <cf>Hello, welcome!
Are you in the middle of a business meeting?　If so, I'll come back later. ......
I hope you don't mind. I am now at ......
I'm really sorry. Another time!
No, it's my pleasure. Please contact me again at ....... <cf>Haha ......
Um, excuse me, are you in some kind of trouble?
What? ...... Ka, Mr. Carvein!　It's real!
Yes, I would like to talk to you. If it's all right with me, I'd like to talk to you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah......Do, what should I do......!
It is the role of the Knights to help those in need. <cf>Please do not hesitate to talk to us.
Oh, you're such a gentleman.
I'm on the receiving end of Master Dunkirk.
Oh, um, ......, <cf>Actually, we've been unable to support the orphanage ......
So far, with the help of the Order, <cf>we've been distributing food.
The Order has had a hard time getting back on its feet since the riots, and <cf>they can't even get around to the orphanage. ......
I know you want to make money, but <cf>we can't just buy at a loss either.
Um, what about government support?
Since it's not just children in the Principality, <cf>formal support is available at ......
The master and his Lord. I'd like to discuss a few things with you [--].
Can I share what I just got from <cf>with this person?
What?　You [--]Oh, no,...... <cf>well, it's just a matter of ...... mmm,...... ......Gunny......
I'm good.
I'm good.
Oh my god, that's how you get them into the flow of passing it on. <cf>Sneaky.
It can't be helped. If this much [--]
Go ahead, take this <span size="Big">all&lt;/&gt; with you!
What's the matter with you, suddenly handing over everything?
Oh, um, no. <cf>We cannot take advantage of your kindness!
Please do not hesitate to spoil them. <cf>It is the children's food for thought.
Dear Mr. Carvein, ......!
A hero indeed!　I fell in love with your manly spirit! <cf>I will buy that in my store at a very high price!
With the added value of a gift from Mr. Carvein, ...... <cf>that's enough for a big feast!
Dear Mr. Carvein, I will never forget this debt of gratitude!
As for me, thank the master and his Lord. <cf>It's only because these people allowed me to do this.
Yes, I am. Thank you very much for your company. <cf>They were really helpful!
Ah ...... haha ...... that was good, mmm.
This is a difficult case. ...... <cf>We need to report this to the public king and have him take action.
If I, the "Hero", can advise the Lord Kings, <cf>the civil magistrates will not be able to ignore what I say.
...... Yes, that's right. I can't afford to run away from being a "hero" <cf>. I have to do what I can as a hero!
I see. The Master and the Master's Lord invited me to the commission to <cf>teach me this ......!
Eh, no, not really. ......
Thank you!　I'm going back to the castle this time. <cf>See you later!
He was self-contained and <cf>left with a fresh smile of his own satisfaction. ......
Oh no~!　I was actually going to use his title and signature to resell <cf>for a high price [~~~]!
I knew it. ......
Well, I'm glad I was able to help people! <cf>But k~y~y~y [~~~]!
...... is why I can't reach you either. Sorry about that.
No, just enough to keep this place running.
Jake, I'm hungry!　Give me something to eat.
If you're going to say that, you should say, 'Please give me something. <cf>You've got to order it right.
Unlike your dad, I'm not going to let you pick up the tab, okay? <cf>...... and I see.
Hey, if it's your dad, <cf>I think these ladies are better at getting in touch with him, don't you?
Is that so?
You met your dad in Kanaloa, right?
Eh?　Oh, yeah. ......, well, yeah. <cf>But I also happened to be in Kanaloa the last time I saw you.
Nah, I see. ......
Hey, Jake. This one is ......?
Sorry for the delay in saying hello. I'm an old friend of your husband [--], or should I say former husband of <cf>?　I'm an old friend of
I haven't seen him in a couple of years. <cf>I was surprised to hear that the owner of the coin-operated pavilion had been replaced.
I came here to see if something was wrong.
His old friend ......?
We were old adventurer buddies. We used to make a lot of money together until he founded this coin pavilion <cf>
When I became an adventurer, this store was already here <cf>. It's been a long time since my dad was still working here.
Well, ...... I started being an adventurer with that guy <cf>about 30 years ago?　We were so young back then.
You can find out more at ....... Hey, what were your husbands like in the olden days?
Yeah? - Yeah.　He was a cocky son of a bitch!
He showed up in Asterleeds on a whim. <cf>I was in the middle of a fight in town, and he beat me up.
He was naive and strangely arrogant. He had a beautiful sword <cf>and I thought he must have run away from home with some young lad.
Then he said he wanted to be an adventurer. <cf>I thought it was a test of my mettle, so I went along with him. ......
So this coin-operated pavilion was built before you knew it.
No, that's skipping too many pauses. <cf>You could go into more detail like this ...... and talk about a weakness you can take advantage of!
Haha!　Well, consider me and that guy <cf>running through our 20's doing stupid shit.
But if it's sudden when he shows up, <cf>it's also sudden when he's gone, isn't it, that guy? ......
Are you guys regulars here?
We are regulars or ...... husband picked me up, <cf>and I picked him up.
I think I heard <cf>that you picked up a girl a few years ago. ...... Oh, yeah, that's you.
Do you miss him now that he's gone?
Nothing? <cf>I'm a smart and extremely beautiful girl who can handle being alone!
Smart hey ....... Well, as for dirty money, <cf>your old man was a drummer too.
Ha-ha-ha!　That's good! <cf>It's an important thing to live for!
Hmmm, her reaction is somewhat similar to my husband's. <cf>I guess we are similar. They are inedible.
You still have friends who can't eat better than me, right? <cf>Yes, I do: ......
If you're interested in his old stories, you can visit a woman named Ruth in Larpal at <cf>
I think you know his weaknesses better than I do.
Well, I'm off then. <cf>If you see your husband, tell him I was worried.
Mm-hmm. If I could see you.
Is the woman in Larpal, Ruth, ....... <cf>I'd like to go talk to her.
Um, is there a person named Ruth here?
Oh, my dear, sweet customer. <cf>I'm Ruth. What's up?
I am a member of the Coin Pavilion in Asterleeds. <cf>I wanted to ask you about your husband's story: ......
......!　You must be Feste! <cf>I've seen you at the Coin Pavilion a few times.
Huh?　Oh, really?
Yeah. Like when I went to that guy's place for a drink. <cf>So just use your normal tone, okay?　Mm-hmm.
Nuh ...... I see, you are a friend who can't eat ......
So?　He's disappeared? <cf>Just so you know, I don't know where he went.
Oh, that's okay. <cf>I just wanted to hear his old stories.
I was wondering if you have any <cf>embarrassing stories that I could ...... exploit?
Hmmm, what's that? <cf>I certainly know a lot about it.
We had adventures together, and at one time we were reasonably <cf>"friendly" ...... with each other, right?
If it's Feste he's so fond of, <cf>I'd be happy to talk to him. It would be a way to get back at him for suddenly disappearing.
By all means!　Don't worry. I'll forgive you.
Yeah, hey, ......, did you get your pants ripped off by Landfox and flee Asteria Plain in just your <cf>underwear?
Also, I heard he slipped and <cf>ran into a pile of Uribo's shit. ......
That husband of yours?　I wish I could have seen it right in front of my eyes!
Hmmm... I feel sorry for you if all your stories are embarrassing, so I'll have to <cf>tell you a few good ones too.
That guy is pretty family oriented. <cf>He really cared about his brother he left behind back home.
You say you're better made or more serious than you are. ...... <cf>Oh, by the way [--].
I once had a rare book that I had <cf>["]I want to give it to my brother ["]"], he begged me.
It's an old adventure story. <cf> My ["]brother likes this kind of stuff, so ["]he's like...
Brother: ......
That guy was friendly and had a lot of friends, but he didn't talk about himself much <cf>, so I remember his brother's story well.
Oh yeah, he was busy at the time, so <cf>I arranged to give it to him instead.
Do you remember the ...... address?
I think it was addressed to someone named Helge at ...... Kanaloa. <cf>If you care about that guy, why don't you ask him?
You're not going?
...... I'm a little too old <cf>to go into their circumstances.
I'll leave the rest to you. Nice to meet you.
If you see him, tell him <cf>he's an idiot.
Ha, yes.
Excuse me. Are you by any chance Mr. Helge?
...... Oh, you've reached this point!
Welcome, both of you. <cf>The Lord King has told me what you have to say.
Do you know us?
Yes, of course.
The map to sneak into Bernhardt's castle, <cf>that was arranged by me at the duke's request.
What a ......!
I have been asked to tell you the truth when you get here <cf>
[--]Would you like to ask <cf>about the dead and living kings?
...... Mm
Now for a bit of a long old story [--].
I'd like to [--], but first, please go to <cf>and get me a copy of "Duke Herb".
What?
Tell him there's nothing more expensive than free. <cf>I've been told by the King of Kings that there's nothing more expensive than free. It's an information fee.
Gunnu ......!　Ayaame ......!
Let's go, servant!　I know it's annoying to do what he wants, but <cf>you can't come all the way here and go home empty-handed!
Well, good luck. Hohoho!
What do you think?　We've got what you asked for!
This is brilliant. As one would expect from the people whom the King has chosen to work for him. <cf>Now, as I promised, let's go to an old story.
I'll be brief.
Well, that depends on this old man's mood. <cf>Hohoho!
Who are you in the first place?
I used to be the Lord King's educator. <cf>When he left the castle, I was no longer needed.
I left the castle: ......
...... that man was a twin!
Your twin brother grew up in a <cf>locked up to be useful as your older brother's shadow warrior.
However, the elder brother lamented it. <cf>He said that his brother was better than him. ......
My brother did not want to be king. <cf>So [--]
He had to leave the castle just before his accession to the throne. <cf>To give up the throne to his younger brother, who was in a shady position. ......
After that, you know better than I do, don't you?
...... while an adventurer in Asterleeds, <cf>where he set up a coin pavilion. ......
Because of the trouble he would have caused if he had left his own blood, he remained single <cf>and helped his younger brother from time to time.
Thanks to his efforts, his brother's reign was relatively <cf>peaceful. ......
Secretly, but steadily growing in power, <cf>the Drava Royal Research Institute took my wife and child hostage.
His brother scrambled to do something about it, but <cf>he ended up being a puppet for the institute [--].
At the hands of Dunkirk, who was bent on avenging his son's <cf>untimely death. ......
So the husband is back in the fold. <cf>I understand the story, but ......
......You're not convinced, is that the look on your face?
If you would like to speak directly with the Lord King, <cf>I would be happy to arrange for you to do so.
Please. I want to talk to him.
I understand. <cf>Now, please go to Bernhardt Castle.
I'm sure he would love to talk to <cf>you guys!
You've come. Helge told me about you.
I see that Jake has taken over the coin pavilion. <cf>I'm relieved. I'm sure he'll do just fine.
......Your old friend came to that coin-operated pavilion. <cf>He was worried about you.
It was Larpal's <cf>Ruth who told me about Helge. 'Tell him he's an idiot,' she told me.
You're still a harsh woman, aren't you?
...... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yeah?
Do you want to abandon the store you built in Asterleeds and <cf>now live as a public king?
You don't tell the truth to the regulars at the store or to your own people <cf>and then just throw it all away like this?
You're going to pretend <cf>that everything you've got in your power never happened!
Don't hold that question.
......I didn't want to be a king. <cf>I wanted to be an adventurer and live on my own.
It was not only me, but also my brother who was imprisoned ....... <cf>That guy had the same dream.
But I pushed everything <cf>to the side and ran away, good thing I have another me.
30 years. <cf>For 30 years, my brother has been with me in my selfishness.
If that's the case, I guess it's my turn to go along with him <cf>
Fortunately, his wife and children are safe. <cf>We can carry his blood to the next generation.
Once you've calmed down the mess in the country, <cf>you can hand the throne over to your nephew and be done with it.
We'll have to put up with that for a few years or so.
...... What then?　Back to Asterleeds?
...... wouldn't it look bad to be on the run again?
The people will be surprised if they find out that the high king has been replaced. <cf>This is a secret, okay?
...... Alright. I'll keep my mouth shut.
But in exchange, I'm going to need some hush money.
That's what I'm talking about. So how much do you want?
The hush money was Bernhardt's information.
Sometimes I'd like you to do this ...... <cf>and tell me the information directly from you.
Feste......
...... to get the Lord King to tell you information. <cf>That's a very high price to pay for keeping your mouth shut.
Okay, I'll take care of it. Let's just get it over with. Okay?
Yes, of course!
Oh, that's refreshing. <cf>Now I'm done. Let's go home, servant!
Oops. You, give me your ear for a second.
...... Please take care of Feste. <cf>That guy is lonelier than most.
I'm glad to have you on ....... Thanks.
This is a servant!　Don't leave the Lord alone. Come quickly!
Farewell, my golden days. ......
So ...... thanks for letting me know. <cf>You guys take care.
Yeah, I'll let you know if I get any more information. I'll let you know if I get any more information. Bye!
Charlotte ......? <cf>What are you doing here?
Oh, it's Feste and the others. You know [--]
You know what, don't. Don't wander around so much. <cf>Do you know what you're getting yourself into?
The armed group must still be out of the picture. <cf>You never know when they will come after you.
U...... sorry. <cf>But I just couldn't help but notice something this time.
I'm here because I heard a rumor <cf>that might have something to do with that armed group.
What ......?
I overheard something at the coin-operated pavilion. <cf>Recently, I heard that there are thieves who target only traveling entertainers.
But they don't steal anything, even though they are called "wild thieves. <cf>Apparently, they are after the traveling entertainers themselves.
I wanted to talk to others <cf>I came over here ......
I didn't think you were that field thief: ......
I've heard rumors about the outfits, <cf>maybe they're the ones who targeted me.
Wait, wait, wait. It's too early to draw any conclusions.
Anyway, ......, yes. <cf>My servant, you and I will gather some more information.
I think I saw some traveling entertainers in town. <cf>Let's go talk to them.
Charlotte, you go back to the pavilion. <cf>It's not safe for you to be alone.
No, I'll stay here and listen a little longer.
It's okay!　I'm already good friends with the clerk here. <cf>To the point that if they see someone suspicious, they'll let me know.
Huh?　When did you get ......
A traveling entertainer has to know how to get into the other person's good graces, right?
Good grief, she's a horrible girl. ......
Well then, I'll ask you to gather information outside. <cf>We'll report back to each other here later.
Sorry~! <cf>Can I talk to you for a minute, brother?
What?　What? What? <cf>I'll tell you anything you want to know, pretty boy.
Oh no, you're so cute! <cf>You know what I'm talking about!
I have a question for such a brother! <cf>Have you been attacked by a burglar recently?
Wild thieves?　Oh, that. It's a rumor among my friends. <cf>They only target us traveling entertainers, right?
Thanks to you, I can't even get around. <cf>I have to hire an escort for safety, and I'm in trouble.
By the way, where are you going to be?
Hmmm ...... I think the first time I heard the rumor was near <cf>Salamzart
Salamzart ...... I see ......
...... You don't think I'm going to try to beat you? <cf>I don't think you should.
Apparently, they're not proper guys, you know? <cf>Anything [--]
[If you don't kill him, he's going to kill you."] and then he's going to <cf>attack you.
That's ...... a little scary.
Yeah. It's not normal. <cf>That's why I said you shouldn't stick your neck out.
Cute girls especially. <cf>Well then, if you feel like it, come and watch me dance!
Hmm?　What do you want from me?
Yes, I am looking for information on this. I heard that there are some brigands who attack only traveling entertainers. <cf>I was wondering if you have any information about them.
Are you guys going to exterminate them? <cf>That would be a big help!
It depends on the occasion. ......, ehehehe
Hmm?　Oh well. <cf>My friend was attacked by those very same thieves the other day.
Huh?　Who is your friend?
He's dead. ...... <cf>People die so easily, don't they?
It's ...... sorry for your loss ......
She was still a young and pretty girl. <cf>I saw the body, and it was a blow to the neck. It's terrible, isn't it?
Really, the only goal is to take lives. ...... <cf>It's not a bandit anymore.
Where was your friend attacked?
According to a fellow traveler, he was on his way from Larpal to <cf>Minsterhorn~!
That's all I know. <cf>Why don't you ask others?
I will do so. Thank you very much!
Yeah, I'd love to. I wish I could. <cf>Avenge your friends!
What's up, you guys? <cf>If you want to see my tricks, you're going to have to pay for them!
Well, don't say so. I was wondering if you knew anything about the recent rumors <cf>about the brigands who attack traveling entertainers...
Ugh, stop it! <cf>I don't even want to remember those guys!
Huh?　Uncle, you didn't tell me you met a bandit!
Yeah, that was last night. <cf>I think it was about the border of the Minster Hills and Andra Basin.
I felt a gaze staring at me, so I turned around <cf>and saw him standing there in the ...... darkness.
His eyes were bloodshot and red. <cf>He was mumbling the whole time.
I saw what he was wearing and realized that the guy I was with was the bandit I'd heard about. <cf>We both escaped with our lives.
...... didn't attack you?
Come to think of it, I didn't see any sign of ...... moving. <cf>I'm pretty sure he looked at me and mumbled something about ["]man["]["]["]no["]. ......
Oh, I got chills when I remembered. <cf>That's all I have to say. Well, I'm back!
Thanks for your help!　Did you have a good harvest?
Well, there you go. <cf>Let's get the information we've got straight [--].
Wild thieves do not attack male traveling entertainers. <cf>Female traveling entertainers don't steal things, they take lives.
His mental state is not normal. <cf> He is muttering, "["]If I don't kill him, he will kill me["]", it seems.
Sightings are near Salamzart, <cf>between Larpal and Minsterhorn ......
As recently as last night, you said it was on the border of the Minster Hills and <cf>Andra Basin.
...... I knew it was a group that came after me at <cf>in Salamzart.
And it's getting closer and closer to here.
If you can't find me at this point, <cf>all the other traveling performers and troupe members will be able to find me at ......!
No, you can't do that!　I have to do something!
Good grief. I like your spirit, but <cf>I think you need to cool down.
What would you do if you had to do something about it? <cf>Take on an armed group by yourself?
U......
We'll help you.
Let us help you.
Are you sure about ......?
Well, it's a boat we're in. Besides [--]
I have a bad feeling about that armed group. <cf>My horns are tingling.
Um, if you could give me a hand, <cf>can I tell you what I think?
From what I've heard, there aren't that many field thieves <cf>like that. Maybe 3 or 4 at most ......
To that extent, I think we can track him down to some ruins and <cf>me and you guys can catch up with him.
No, it's your legs you're confident in, isn't it? <cf>The arms are not.
I've never had the chance to show it off, but <cf>I can actually handle a bow.
And while I was on the run with Carvein, <cf>I got quite a workout!
It is said that the best defense is a good offense. <cf>So I thought it might be a good idea to try to set them off.
Hmmm......... that's a good idea if you don't have many opponents. <cf>Then, we just need to find a way to lure them to ......
Yes, ...... if the most recent sightings are near the <cf>Minster Hills and Andra Basin. ......
How about something like "Giant Tower Ruins"?
If you walk around that area prominently, <cf>I'm sure they'll catch on eventually.
It's a rough plan, but <cf>there's no other way to rush the solution ...... or
That's fine. I'll go with your idea. <cf>But don't be reckless, okay?
Roger that!　I'll show you a lot of my archery skills.
Okay, so the wild thief sightings are around here. <cf>How do we find them?
You don't have to. <cf>They're already close by: ......
...... traveling entertainers...... women...... baboons, baboons......
You're a wild thief. ...... <cf>You noticed: ......
On the way here. <cf>I pretended I didn't notice and led them away.
I'm looking at ...... over here. <cf>How many people are looking at ......3?　Four?　Maybe.
Charlotte. <cf>Let's see how good you are with that bow.
I know you're looking at me [--] I know you're looking at me!
GWH!
I hit it!
I knew it was those guys from back then!
Women...... travelers...... kills....... <cf>Charlotte...... colossal...... kills......!
Servant! Drive them to the "Giant Tower Ruins"! <cf>Charlotte, keep shooting arrows!
Copy!
[--]Haaah!
G......gu uu......!
They got away!　Good, let's go after them!
Ugh ...... these guys are heavy. Shall we dump them here?
No!　We're not letting <cf>go until we're clear on what these people are up to!
I'll have to ask him to tell me where the rest of his friends are.
So I'm going to continue to take you to <cf>Asterleeds at any cost ......!
Kuu, unexpected hard work. ......
Hmm?　Oh, no, you're awake. <cf>Even though he's tied up, it's not safe for him to run amok.
You're my servant. I'll give him a little shot and knock him out [--].
Uu...... <span size="Big">uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! &lt;/&gt;
Hey, what!　What is it!
Korosu Charlotte korosu Charlotte korosu <cf>Charlotte korosu korosu or else korosarererererererere
Oh ......aaaaa ...... <span size="Big">I hate it! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, hey, you fell down bubbling!
....... <cf>............ dead.
Bullshit ......!
What the ...... servants say is true. <cf>They are ...... dead ......!
Such is the case with ......!　It's our fault!
Calm down. Make sure we're alive. <cf>You dragged us all the way here.
Is this more of a ...... seizure? <cf>We're all ...... at once because we've run out of use?
What is that? You're not a puppet!
...... puppets, huh? Maybe I'm not so wrong.
These guys were acting strange. <cf>They didn't seem to be in a sane state of mind.
Are they all being put on something suggestive, like <cf>that has been unraveled ......?
For that matter, it's such a sudden ......
...... lizard tail cutting. <cf>The main body is separate ......?
Charlotte. I still think you should stay in Asterleeds and <cf>try to stay off the streets as much as possible.
If you are attacked while we are gone, run to the temple. <cf>Einlein will help you.
There are guards there, <cf>and they won't be so easy to get to.
Umm, yeah ......
Haha ...... this has turned out to be a bad aftertaste this time.
I'm sorry I got ...... involved.
It's okay. <cf>Let's go back to Asterleeds.
(I wonder what ...... something ......)
(Something tremendous, <cf>I feel like something big is happening ......)
Oh, Einrain. Are you taking a break?
If you're ...... bounded, you're in good shape.
I see. That's good. <cf>Don't be too hard on yourself.
You can find out more at ....... <cf>Yes, this.
I just received this from Carvein. <cf>Can you give him the letter addressed to Charlotte ......?
...... Carvein, he seems very concerned <cf>about the armed groups.
She wrote in a letter to me at ...... that she wanted me to keep her safe <cf>while she was in Asterleeds.
Come to think of it, he hasn't seen Charlotte much since the whole Duchy and Order fiasco <cf>
All right, I'll give you the letter. I'll give her the letter. <cf>Charlotte will be pleased.
...... If she writes back, deliver it to me. <cf>I will give it to her. ......
It's safer and you get there ...... faster ......
Copy that. I'll let them know.
Ouch. Charlotte!　A letter for you. <cf>It's from Carvein.
From Carvein!　Let me see!
......Good, looks like you're doing well for now.
What does it say?
I'm sorry for staying away from you even though I'm ......["]your escort. <cf>I'll be sure to come see you when things settle down["]......
Carvein looks a bit like a <cf>prince in a play, doesn't he? Heh.
He is not a prince. <cf>He is more of a guard dog.
Well, it's good to be witty.
In your letter to Einrain, you also wrote that you wanted <cf>to take care of you.
Letter to Einrain: ......?
Oh, that letter was given to me by Einrain.
Yes, he did. He also said if you write back, Einlein will put it together and give it to <cf>Carvein!
Einlein collectively ......?
...... Is Einlein meeting with Carvein?
I don't say often, but there are also discussions between the Duchy and the Order <cf>. Maybe. I don't know.
Yes ......, I know. We used to be friends and now we're heroes and <cf>oracle priestesses. We see each other a lot.
It's only natural, yes. ......
What's wrong with you?
It's ...... nothing. But I'll respond to your letter at <cf>I'll go give it to Einrain myself.
No, no, no, you shouldn't go out so much. <cf>We'll [--]
<span size="Big">I'll go on my own.
What is this indescribable pressure? ......!
Well, I'll have to write back to you as soon as possible. <cf>Thanks for getting it to me. Okay, bye.
Hmmm............yeah, I was told that, but I'm kinda worried about it. <cf>We'll go to the temple later, just in case.
I wrote a letter to Carvein. <cf>Can you deliver it to me?
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
(A priestess of the oracle, but a friend of his ......)
(Her face is a ...... beautiful girl, isn't it? She also has a mysterious vibe.)
(And his voice is ...... fragile and adorable.)
(I'm sure Carvein knows <cf>his personality better than ...... I do.)
(Overall, it makes you want to protect ......?)
(And ...... style, also ......)
Charlotte, what's wrong ......?
...... Ohhhhhh, you can't win!
(But, but, but, I'm not losing! <cf>I think I'm on the right track!　I'm a reputed diva!)
(Even the group leaders said it was cute! <cf>If you give up, it's over!　Yeah, it's okay!)
I'm not going to lose!
Eh ...... yes ......? <cf>Uh, God bless Bapharia: ......
Praying there!　It's a sign that you can afford it!
What ...... is not a scene to congratulate, no?
There is none!　Thanks for the blessing from the oracle priestess though!
How about ...... you're welcome ......?
Oh my gosh, I'm sure that kind of pouty feeling is good, <cf>!　I want one too!
？？？？？
What are they doing?
I don't know about you, but I can smell the youth of ...... ......
Oh Myulie, do you have any easy and reasonable requests?
As usual, Feste. <cf>Not so many requests like that[--].
I'd like to say there isn't, but <cf>there is, and this is ......
What the hell?　Tell us quickly! <cf>We'll take it before someone else does!
Relax. This request came in just a few minutes ago. <cf>I haven't put the call out yet. Because ......
The request and the fee are so out of proportion. <cf>I'm a little suspicious.
Huh?　What is the content?
I want you to get me a few days' worth of supplies. <cf>And this is the reward.
What about ......?　What's with the high fees?
Hey, isn't this a mistake? <cf>If it were true, even I would be skeptical.
I thought so too and checked with my client. <cf>They said it wasn't a mistake.
A bad deal called commodities: ......?
I'm not sure if that's a possibility.
......, which is why I'm asking Feste and her friends to <cf>this.
Nothing suspicious about the client or the content. <cf>Just not worth the reward.
Way to go, Feste! <cf>That's exactly what I was looking for: an easy, good-paying job!
Huh?　So you were going to impose on us from <cf>the very beginning, weren't you!
So far, Jake has been taking care of these suspicious requests <cf>with the investigation.
You guys are Jake's favorite disciples, <cf>I'm sure you'll be in good hands!
Who's your disciple?　Who!
......Well, I've been indebted to the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>Maybe we should return the favor once in a while?
Thanks! <cf>If you want to talk to my client, go to the temple.
Oh, no?　Feste and the others ...... <cf>What's wrong?
I'm here today on business from the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I heard you have a client here.
Pioneer Bureau ...... What? <cf>Perhaps you were the one who took care of that request: ......
Hmm?　We've accepted <cf>"Buy me daily necessities." ......
Yes, that's me. That's me.
<span size="Big">You are the one! &lt;/&gt;
Wow, that all became clear at once. <cf>You don't know the price of a commission, do you?
Did I do something wrong with that ......? <cf>Did I do something wrong?
No, well, never mind. <cf>I'm just glad to know it's not a shady request.
By the way, what are daily necessities? <cf>Is there something wrong with taking care of the temple?
No, the people of the temple are very good to me.
This time, I was completely complacent, or <cf>I guess my inadequacy came out in full force. ......
Mm-hmm?　Don't be shy, just tell me what's going on.
...... I stayed here <cf>because I'm worried about Tyris, but [--]
I'm so sorry <cf>for all the burden I've put on you ......
So I was thinking about what I could do to help, and then I got to know the grandmother who came to <cf>the temple.
The grandmother is having trouble going shopping <cf>because her legs have become weak due to old age.
I thought I could help with the shopping for daily necessities <cf>, but I offered to help ......
I have to say, shopping at multiple places and spending money <cf>is quite challenging for me, so I ......
After getting into trouble, he made a request to the Pioneer Bureau, saying...
Yes, I did. I had no idea that <cf>you guys would take care of that. ......
No, I'm rather glad it was us. <cf>I'll have to thank Myulie later.
Well, it turns out there's no case, so <cf>let's get this over with.
The daily necessities I need are from the Pioneer Bureau <cf>Is this list correct?
Yes. Nemalina Soap, Fluffy Flour, <cf> and Safrea Seeds.
OK. Let's buy "Nemalina's Soap" and "Fluffy Flour" from the <cf>peddler.
The "Sufflare Seeds" can be found at ...... <cf>It would be quicker to go and collect this one.
Well, we're off to stock up.
Well, then, I, too [--].
Since you are the client this time, <cf>you should wait here. That's the way it's supposed to be.
I understand ....... <cf>Best regards.
Welcome!　What can we get for you today?
I'd like to have "Nenemalina's Soap" if you have it.
Yes, we have it - "Nenemalina soap"! <cf>This is popular, isn't it?　Hi, here you go!
Mm. Indeed!
Hello~. What are you doing here today?
I'd like to have "Fluffy Flour" if you have it.
Fluffy Flour" has a good one in it!
Oh, this will satisfy your grandmother.
Collected "Safrea Seeds".
This is the "suffragette seed. <cf>I knew it was faster to collect them.
Hohoho. <cf>I was right in my judgment!
Sorry to keep you waiting, client. <cf>I've got your daily necessities!
Thank you very much! <cf>You are indeed a skilled adventurer!
Yes, you're on the list. <cf>Now, let's go to your grandmother's.
Excuse me, granny. <cf>Is this the item you need?
Oh, thank you!　It really helped. <cf>It's hard to shop at my age. ......
I'm happy to help again if you need it. <cf>I would say ......
This time, it was the people at <cf>who helped us with what we needed.
Oh, no, we are ......
I am not strong enough to ....... <cf>I am so embarrassed.
Oh, I see. Thanks, ladies.
And hey, Mr. Aerinse. There's no shame in relying on <cf>people to do what you can't do yourself!
You see, this is why I turned to Mr. Aerinse. <cf>In this world, we help each other. See?
When you go to the Temple, I hope you'll talk to me again. <cf>See you then.
...... This completes the request. Thank you very much. <cf>We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
I don't mind this level of hassle. But [--]
First of all, you need to get your financial sense right. <cf>I'll tell you now, what was that high compensation?
What?　For my part, I thought that was about the market price: ......
It's too expensive!　It's okay that we took care of it, but if we had submitted a request like that <cf>, the market would have collapsed!
To begin with, responding to requests from residents requires a wealth of knowledge and <cf>the ability to apply it to any situation.
You are unfamiliar with this era, and you, who grew up as a princess, <cf>suddenly have limits to what you can do on your own.
Ugh ...... you are right ....... <cf>I may have been a bit hasty!
Feste is right, I will try to get used to the world. <cf>First of all, I need to improve my financial sense!
In that case, what should I do? <cf>Try shopping a lot or ......?
I can only see a future of wasting money. ...... <cf>That's right. ......
To get a better idea of how people in this time and age act and think, how about trying <cf>a customer service job?
And if you are physically active, you are less likely to feel anxious that you are the only one doing nothing. <cf>
...... yes, that's right. Jake's place should be fine! <cf>If you do, I suggest you help out at the Coin Pavilion.
That's a great idea! <cf>I will ask Jake to do this as soon as possible!
After a while [--]
Welcome!
Aerinse!　What are you dressed like that?
Here are your work clothes. <cf>If you are going to work, you have to change, Jake said.
Servant. Go get Myulie. Tell her Jake is happy to have <cf>an innocent woman dressed as a maid.
STOP! You've got it all wrong! <cf>That was Mr. Aerinse's own choice!
Well, that's one of the candidates, but ......
Hou. What else is there?
Hmm?　This or that or ......?
Mewry! <cf>Here's a pervert!
You're just a little short in the skirt, oooh!
I like it, though.
That guy there!　What a strong-looking guy there! <cf>Will you listen to me for a minute?
Hm?　When you say someone who seems strong around here, <cf>Master is applicable, is that right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes. You too, by the way. <cf>You're adventurers, right?　Please, let me make a request.
What's with the suddenness? I'm telling you, we're expensive. <cf>It's not that easy to get a commission.
Are you in trouble? <cf>We'll lend a hand if we can.
Carvein!　Why do you so <cf>cheaply promise?
I'm sorry. My <cf>knightly pride would not allow me to leave someone in trouble.
Ha ...... you are a sweet man. <cf>Oh well. I'm not going to waste my time here.
Tell us what you're asking for. <cf>Be prepared to pay a surcharge in some cases.
I hope you don't mind the extra charge, but you can get it at ....... <cf>We're in real trouble.
A while ago, monsters started showing up, <cf>and they're wreaking havoc on the village.
They come in the morning, at night, sometimes even during the day. <cf>People don't have time to work anymore. ......
That's tough. You don't even have time to relax.
Master!　I would like to help these people. <cf>May I?
Oh. Can't overlook someone in need.
Yup. Can't overlook someone in need.
Thank you!　You are indeed a master!
Huh, at ......?　What do we do? <cf>Do we intercept the monsters as they come at us?
No, I want you to get ahead of this if you can. <cf>I can't stand to have my village raided anymore: ......
I know where he lives. <cf>It's just west of here.
Please save us. Please! <cf>If we don't, our village will die!
Yeah, leave it to me and my master! <cf>We will surely save the village!
Oh dear. Good-natured teacher-disciple. <cf>Well, if it's a request that comes with a reward, so be it.
The monster's home is west of here. <cf>Let's take a quick peek.
According to information, this area seems to be the home of the <cf>monsters that come to attack the village. ......
...... Looks like he's not here right now.
Muuu...... let's see how it goes for a bit.
[I've been waiting and waiting, but he hasn't shown up at all! <cf>Are you sure this is the right place?
Maybe we're in the wrong place. <cf>Let's go back to the village once.
Oh, you guys! <cf>I guess we must have gotten separated.
A monster attacked me earlier. <cf>I should have had them intercept me here: ......
Oh my!　And so the damage to the village!
It [--]
Don't worry. There is no damage whatsoever.
After all, our proud Knights of Bernhardt have <cf>welcomed them!
You, Bernhardt's ......
Mr. Hugo!
No, I happened to come across the scene of the attack. <cf>I couldn't pass it up. ......
However, it could not be stopped. <cf>That thing is smart, isn't it? He knows when to pull back.
What a nasty monster to be targeted by!
Even the knights of the duchy missed it. <cf>What are we going to do about it? ......
...... Carvein, did you guys <cf>get a request from this gentleman to take down?
Ha, yes. As one of the knights of the principality, <cf>I cannot overlook someone in need.
You are so humble to call yourself one of the knights. <cf>You are a "hero," so you should be more dignified.
I'm ......
Now, those of you who know Carvein. <cf>What do you think?　How about a joint fight here?
You think it's a co-op?
Yes, we do. It takes a lot of manpower to defeat that monster. <cf>And you have to be good at it.
Unfortunately, however, there are only three knights that I am bringing <cf>as escorts for the inspection
That's where we need your help, including Carvein, <cf>You guys can help us out!
Oh!　Of course, if we are successful, <cf>we'll give you all the rewards!
I am still a public figure. <cf>I can't line my own pockets on an inspection tour.
So, it is purely a matter of helping people. <cf>What do you think?
...... We haven't even seen the monster yet. <cf>But the Knights have already fought him off.
Then, as he says, it would be more efficient to join forces with <cf>
So we have a negotiation. So, now that we are friends.
As soon as possible, can you take me to <cf>where the monsters live? I need to check a few things.
I'll leave the protection of the village to the Knights, so <cf>I'll leave you guys to protect me.
You're Mr. Hugo's escort or ....... <cf>I have to be careful not to look at the lady on the way.
I don't like it, Carvein! <cf>I'm always all about work, right?　Haha!
We have arrived. This area is where the monsters live. <cf>...... Apparently, they haven't returned yet!
That's convenient. <cf>Let me do a little research for you.
...... Hey, what if <cf>he's headed back to the village?
I'm sure you're right. <cf>And I made sure it happened before I left the village.
Well, what about ......? <cf>The ...... that made it so!
Yes, I know. But it's okay. <cf>What do you think I left the Knights in the village for?
See, while they're attracting the monsters, <cf>we'll be looking for a place to live!
You, from the very beginning, were planning to use your friends as bait!
Please don't be so angry. <cf>I couldn't help but notice something.
...... That monster is not attacking villages for food. <cf>There must be another reason to attack a village somewhere.
Well, I have an idea what it is. <cf>I just need one more dot to connect the dots.
Oh, the knights of the duchy are sturdy. <cf>They won't die in the slightest, don't worry.
You're a smart guy!
Sorry. Hold it down for now.
All Knights are used to this kind of thing. <cf>It's our job to be physical.
Better yet, as Mr. Hugo said, <cf>Let's explore this area.
Mr. Hugo is a man of one or two habits, but <cf>he has not served as a high civilian official.
I am sure He will find a way to reach a solution.
...... If you, a member of the Order, say so, I can't blame you. <cf>I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'll check around here.
......!　Look at this!
......!　Watch this!
...... human footprints and the ruins of the razed. <cf>I knew it.
This is definitely what caused the monsters to attack the village: <cf>
What do you mean? <cf>I don't really understand it myself. ......
Someone in the village took the monster's children. <cf>That species can sell the children for a higher price as material.
Material ....... <cf>Greed in the making. ......
It is enough to know this. Let's hurry back to the village. <cf>We need to check the current status of the children.
Dear Hugo!　I am so glad you are safe!
I knew you were attacked by a monster. <cf>Are you struggling?
I am ashamed to say. I have succeeded in directing you to <cf>, as Mr. Hugo told me to do [--].
Capturing them is a painstaking process. <cf>Anyway, we are short of manpower.
It's okay, it's okay. <cf>Carvein and the others will lend a hand.
[--]So, please take care of them. <cf>Oh, and please capture the monsters, not kill them.
You can say whatever you like. <cf>It can't be helped. Let's go, Carvein to the servants!
Okay, it looks like you managed to capture it.
Let's go back to the village and report back.
I never thought I'd really catch that monster. ...... <cf>Thank you!　Thank you!
Now I can finally sleep in peace: ......
Oops, I haven't solved the problem yet. <cf>I have to ask you something.
I know there are people in ...... this village who took that monster's <cf>children for money!
......ッ!
In the meantime, I don't care if the child is alive or dead. <cf>Would you please come forward?
[--]If you remain silent, <cf>I'll release the monster right here and now, but
No, don't! <cf>It was me!　It was me!
You ......!
I'm sorry. <cf>I just had a hunch when I found the nest. ......
......What about the children?
Still alive. I can sell it for more money that way. ......
You've got to be kidding me! <cf>We're all in trouble because of you!
I'm so sorry! <cf>I was too scared to tell you. ......
You son of a bitch!
Yes, that's enough. <cf>Don't make things worse!
But because of this guy, everyone!
Fortunately, there were no fatalities, right? <cf>Then there is still room for discussion.
First of all [--] what is the problem in the first place?
Huh?　That's because this guy kidnapped <cf>a monster child ......
Why did you have to?
My ...... grandma is not feeling well. <cf>I wanted to get her treated in the Principality or Asterleeds: ......
So I needed some money as soon as possible. <cf>There's a limit to how much money I can borrow from people in the village. ......
You got your answer. <cf>So, poverty was the cause.
If he didn't have to worry about money, he wouldn't have gone on such a rampage of stealing monster children <cf>
Yes ...... but ......
With all due respect, this village is not affluent as a whole!
Then why don't we first think about how we can all enjoy the wealth <cf>
Well, that's such a hard thing for us to do. ......
If it's okay with me, I'll be happy to discuss it with you. <cf>I have a certain amount of face in the Principality.
....... <cf>In the meantime, meet my dad, ......, the village chief.
You go get your monster child. <cf>And we'll take care of the money. ......
......ッ!　Sorry. Thanks ......!
That's okay too. I told you I'm facetious in the Principality <cf>
It is nothing more than a doctor's appointment. <cf>Rest assured.
Well, thank you <cf>for your assistance this time!
We'll take care of the rest, so don't worry about it. <cf>Oh, and I'll give you your reward, too.
Now, I will go to the village chief's house to see him. <cf>Have a good day, everyone!
As ...... you said, <cf>you have not served as a high civilian official.
He took advantage of the uproar to win the hearts and minds of the villagers.
I believe you said you were on an inspection tour for a resettlement project. <cf>...... will be one of the candidate sites.
Geez, ......, you winked at us. <cf>You know we'll know what you're up to.
He never misses an opportunity he finds. ...... <cf>You are a bottomless pit.
You are both just in the right place. <cf>May I ask you a small favor?
Yes?　Depends on what you have to say. Let's see.
Thank you very much. Because of your closeness to Mr. Einrain and <cf>you are the ones we are asking you to help us with this case.
In fact, someone claiming to be a "oracle priestess" has recently appeared and has been misleading the people of <cf>[the city].
Is that not Einlein that escaped the ...... temple?
I don't deny that Mr. Einrain has [wanderlust] <cf>
But Mr. Einrain is doing his job well here at <cf>
So, I can assure you that the oracle priestess who appeared in [Shisei] is <cf>a fake!
Priestesses of the oracle basically do not appear <cf>in public except in ceremonies and pilgrimages. I thought it was therefore easier to deceive them.
I see. ...... So, from the flow of the conversation, <cf>you want us to catch the impostor?
Yes, I am. As you know, due to the incident with the Duchy of Bernhardt, <cf>the Order does not have the manpower to spare.
That said, you can also hire adventurers to work for ...... for the content of the content. <cf>What do you think?　Would you be willing to take on the job?
All right, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.
Okay, I'm on it. Got it.
I am also interested in the Einlein impostor. <cf>As the servant says, I'll give you a piece of my skin here.
God's people in Bapharia. <cf>Thank you very much for your help.
It is a fake, but one of the priests witnessed it just the other day. <cf>It would be better to speak to him directly.
There you are, priest!　Is it you who claims to have seen an impostor priestess?
Yes, sir. Mr. Lugerio has asked me to tell you <cf>the details.
It was in Bergmar that I saw the shaman impostor.
I've been going over there <cf>regularly to pray for the victims of the destruction of the village.
There were a few former residents of <cf>the village when I was there, probably to clean up the mess.
And at the center of it all was the impostor.
I had never seen the oracle's priestess <cf>before, so ......
From the stories of the villagers, I mistakenly thought that the priestess was <cf>here!
So I thought I'd take this opportunity to say hello, and when I spoke to him, he <cf>ran away.
I was caught in a strange and impatient attitude, so I <cf>hurried back to the temple and reported the Berkmar case [--].
It was a fake.
Yes, I am sure that the oracle priestess was praying at that time. At that time, the oracle priestess was praying in the <cf>sanctuary
Hmmm ....... What was the reaction of the people in Berkmar at that time <cf>?
Everyone praised the impostor. <cf>They said he treated them all very well.
He said that they not only prayed for him, but also treated his injuries <cf>without compensation and helped him clean up the village.
You're not trying to [discredit] our reputation. ......
...... I'm ashamed to admit that if I hadn't run away, <cf>I might have believed it was real too!
She was a simple girl, 15-6 years old in appearance. <cf>She was graceful, kind, and had pure eyes.
I don't think that girl is up to anything <cf>and I don't think she's very ......
Still, there's no doubt <cf>that the oracle maiden's name was deceitful.
Yes, yes ....... Yes, that's right. ......
I would like to hear what the villagers have to say. <cf>I would like to know what their impressions are of the imposters.
Once that is decided, we will leave for Berkmar as soon as possible!
Hmm?　What is it, you guys? <cf>Are you here on business in an abandoned building like this?
Sorry I'm in the middle of cleaning up. I heard that there is a <cf>oracle priestess around here.
Oh~ that's too bad. <cf>There used to be a priestess of the oracle until the other day.
He was truly a wonderful man. <cf>He was kind and caring. ......
To think that someone like that is leading a cult, <cf>only increases my faith!
I see. I would love to meet you! <cf>By the way [--]
Was the oracle priestess alone? <cf>Did you have an attendant or anything like that? ......
No, I was alone from the beginning. <cf>I wandered into this abandoned building and ......
["]Is there anything you need help with[,]"] and he <cf>was willing to help me.
At first I thought it was some village girl. <cf>The way she prayed for the victims in mourning was so divine. ......
Some village girl: ......
Um, did the oracle priestess identify herself?
Well, I never got to name names: ......
Someone called out "oracle priestess" and she was laughing <cf>like she was in trouble. I bet she was a ninja.
I see. Thank you. <cf>Good luck with the cleanup!
Hey, guys. <cf>I hope you guys get to meet the priestess too!
Just a quick question: <cf>Have you ever met the oracle priestess?
Yes, I have. Just the other day! <cf>Look, look. This injury was treated by a priestess.
When I was cleaning up, I accidentally cut my palm. <cf>The priestess noticed it and immediately treated me.
Really, hey ...... that guy is great!
I thought I'd do something to thank you. <cf>["]Your smiles are the best thank you ["].
You are indeed a person who can hear God's voice. <cf>You are different from us!
...... Excuse me, but <cf>was that person really a priestess of the oracle?
What are you talking about?　If she's not the oracle priestess, <cf>who is?
Well, I guess he was on the road. <cf>He didn't identify himself to me, but ......
I see. <cf>Thank you very much for your story!
I guess he doesn't identify himself, after all. <cf>Hmmm ......
Excuse me, do you know <cf>where the oracle priestess went?
If you're the oracle priestess, I went to Larpal. <cf>It's not safe for her to be alone, so I offered to give her a lift.
They said, "["]God bless you, you'll be fine["] <cf>and I got Decline.
I see. Thank you very much.
Muuu....... I don't feel refreshed. <cf>I'll give you some time to think about it.
First, let's organize the information.
The fake is a naive girl of 15-6 years old, but <cf>enough to make a third priest who witnesses her fall in love with her.
He is adored by the villagers he has met in person and is <cf>very kind and thoughtful.
She also apparently acts alone and <cf>does not call herself an oracle priestess, but neither does she deny it.
When I first heard about ......, I thought you were taking money from <cf>under the guise of Einlein's name.
There doesn't seem to be any sign of that at this point. <cf>Or will they reveal their true nature after they win the hearts and minds of the people? ......
Let's go to Larpal. It can't have been that long since the girl left here <cf>
Let's go to Larpal. It can't have been that long since the girl left here <cf>
That's right. Even if you had already left Larpal, you could at least pick up some information at <cf>
Priestess of the oracle!　Please present this to me.
Thank you very much. <cf>But please, just the sentiment is fine.
I cannot take it. <cf>Please share it with others.
Miko ...... how merciful!
Excuse me for interrupting! <cf>Are you the oracle priestess?
We are from the Order. <cf>We are here to welcome the priestess of the oracle.
[--]!　Oh, um, I ......
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm interrupting. See you then. <cf>Thank you very much, miko!
Now, let's get down to business. <cf>Let me get straight to the point. You are an imposter of the oracle priestess, aren't you?
The Order has asked me to search for you. <cf>I want you to come with me to the temple in Asterleeds.
...... Yes. Understood.
Hmm?　You are so obedient. <cf>You don't resist or run away?
Because if the Order has found out about my existence, <cf>there would be no point in running away. Besides ......
I am actually a little relieved. I thought I would no longer have to trick <cf>the oracle priestess into believing her name.
Before we go to the ...... temple, can you tell us what's going on?
......I am an ordinary and unremarkable girl. <cf>My family used to tell me that.
[You're the same whether you're here or not. <cf>You are like air.
Then one day, an oracle priestess stopped by the village and approached me <cf>
It was just your voice through the door. ...... <cf>["]You are not air. You are talking to me ["]"]
[Thanks to your presence, I am having a good time during my pilgrimage <cf>.
[I am sure that the time with you is a <cf>gift from the God of Bapharia ["]"] and ......
This makes Einlein quite the <cf>philanderer ......
For me, the miko's words were an oracle. <cf>She said that even an existence like mine could be useful to someone.
So I took the plunge and left home. I joined the Order <cf>to serve God and live a life of service, just like a priestess.
...... helping people along the way has thrown a wrench in the <cf>gears!
I was so happy when he thanked me. When he asked me my name, <cf>I didn't think to say ["]I'm a priestess of the Order ["]I'm a priestess of the Order ["]I'm a priestess of the Order.
Well, I'm a [I'm going to be] a priestess of the [I'm going to be] a priestess of the [I'm going to be] a priestess of the [I'm going to be] a priestess of the [I'm going to be] <cf>but I was so excited about it ......
Then, people who were there <cf>started asking me for help with one problem after another!
It's nice to be depended on, so if <cf>we were sincerely trying to solve the problem [--].
One of these days, someone will say I'm <cf>a priestess of the oracle and ......
Wouldn't it have been better to deny it right then and there?
When I looked into your expectant eyes, I felt uncomfortable <cf>to say that I was different, so I just kept on cheating ......
I knew it was wrong. <cf>How could I be misunderstood by the oracle priestess?
But I didn't want to cloud everyone's faces. <cf>I was afraid of disappointment!
So ...... now that you've come to catch me like this, <cf>it's more of a liberation.
Finally ...... they can punish me ......
I know you have no ill will. <cf>You can tell me everything you just told me in the temple.
I don't think it will be made to look so bad ......
No, I will Accept any punishment. Of all people, <cf>I deceived you in the name of a respected oracle priestess.
Mwah ....... In the meantime, let's take this girl down to <cf>Lugerio.
[--]And well, this girl's deception of the oracle maiden's name started with a misunderstanding <cf>around her.
The girl herself never had any guilty thoughts, <cf>and her only motive was to help someone else,
Just because you were afraid of disappointing <cf>those around you by denying the misconception that you were a priestess of the oracle.
...... I see. I understand what's going on.
What a pure heart! <cf>This is simply too much to punish.
What do you think, Mr. Lugerio? <cf>As for this girl, I say that the sentence is reduced [--].
As a priest, don't let your emotions get the better of you.
Regardless of the circumstances, the crime of making people think that she was a priestess of the oracle is a serious one. <cf>It is the same as having conspired against the god of Bapharia.
No, but this girl ended up helping people and gaining respect for <cf>the oracle priestess, right?
It's okay. I'm ready.
There was no malice. But sin is sin. <cf>I must Accept the punishment for having conspired against God.
You should try a little legwork, my friend.
Originally, I was going to serve God in body and soul.
Mr. Lugerio ......
...... you are ready to serve God and <cf>be a martyr to Him?
Yes, I am. It was the words of the oracle priestess that gave me, an airy person, the meaning of my existence <cf>
I would be more than happy if you could punish <cf>the god of Bapharia whom that priestess serves!
...... understand. <cf>Now, as Chief Priest, I will pronounce the verdict.
You will be working under the oracle priestess <cf>Einrain-sama from today!
What, ......?
Oh!
You should study under a real oracle priestess. If you love God and are willing <cf>to follow his will, we will accept you!
Oh thank you for ......! <cf>I will work hard!　I offer myself to God!
Good. Then, after giving thanks to God, <cf>ask the priest there to show you the way.
Oh, thank goodness. You are one of <cf>God's fellow servants today. Let's work together!
You are also very mean. <cf>If you were going to forgive, you should have done so from the beginning.
I thought my intention to be a martyr to God was genuine. <cf>Had I been different, I would have sentenced him to severe punishment.
...... By the way, what is severe punishment?
Those who [fool] God do not deserve to breathe in this land. <cf>It is the same for those of us in our cult. ......
If I or Master Einrain were to act against God <cf>, we would be severely punished as well!
We always serve God with that much determination. <cf>Please remember that. ......
Oh, hey. Are you okay?
Lalaforte......I'm tired of singing too much......
Oh ...... it's hard to keep singing in shifts, even if it's to create offerings to the <cf>gods!
No, no, no. It's a prestigious and important job, and <cf>we can't afford to be weak at this level!
...... but you can't deny that it's stressful <cf>......
Normally, I'm in a singing class with all my students <cf>to relieve stress ......
A singing class, you say?
Yes...Â It's part of the Order's outreach.
I was the teacher, and we had singing classes for congregants and non-believers alike <cf>
Lalaforte's singing class, I loved it too. ...... <cf>I miss that one: ......
Thank you, Dear Einrain. <cf>I miss you too: ......
I put out a notice the other day that classes are back in session. <cf>Due to cutbacks in public relations expenses, it didn't get everyone's attention for a while.
I think as long as the students return, we can reopen ....... <cf>I would also ask Lugerio for more ......
So I hope ...... students will deliver <cf>the notice of reopening ......
What a casual and natural request!
I ask you to do the same. <cf>It is also important to create a stress-free work environment!
Yes, yes, yes, I understand. <cf>We can't do without the Chronogram.
Where are those students now?
Where are those students now?
That, sir, seems to have scattered quite a bit.
If we could get in touch with the five people who played a central role, <cf>we could reach the whole ......
I heard that one of them used to show up at a place called "Rudder Wheel Pavilion" <cf>
Her name is Grace. <cf>She might be able to tell you where the other students are.
Please contact us at ...... and we will do our best to serve you well. <cf>We will do our duty. ......
Well, first of all, there's Grace from "Rudder Wheel Pavilion". <cf>Don't worry, leave it to us!
Oh, what is it?　Is this an announcement from the Temple?
...... Well, the singing classes are back on track! <cf>So nice to hear you sing again, Lara.
Lara, your songs always inspire me. <cf>Thanks for bringing the news to us.
Lalaforte told me to find the 5 main people <cf>. ......
Yup, one is in Asterleeds. <cf>I'll give him a call!
Oh, that helps!
The other three are a bit far away. ...... <cf>Can you contact them for me?
Of course.
Then please, they should be in <cf>Larpal, Litze, and Salamzart, respectively.
I'm sure everyone will be flying in when they hear the news of the reopening. <cf>Looking forward to it!
It's all been beautifully dispersed. <cf>Well, let's go where we can!
Hi, is there something on my face? <cf>Hmm?　Is this an announcement from the ...... temple?
Wow!　Lalaforte's singing class is starting up again? <cf>I'm going, I'm going, I'm definitely going!
Why don't you try to learn it? <cf>It's a lot of fun and you'll get a better voice!
Yes, I can't let this happen. <cf>I have to call everyone else!
La~Lalaforte~♪ Hmmm ...... I knew it, <cf>I'm not as good as Lalaforte.
Me?　Yeah, I'm a student in the singing class. <cf>[--] What?　You're doing the class again?　Really?
Glad to hear it! <cf>I love Lalaforte's singing class, it's fun!
I have some students in this village, so I'll talk to them! <cf>I'm sure they'll be very happy to hear from you!
...... An?　What's up, guys? <cf>What do you want from me?
Singing class oooh ......?　Ha, no such thing ......
<span size="Big">Of course I'm going! &lt;/&gt;
I can't tell you how hard the days were for me not to see Lalaforte at <cf>!
He took away that sun-like smile and angelic singing voice <cf>I thought I'd just die ......
Ugh ...... I'm so glad I'm alive. ...... <cf>Thank you God!!!
Okay, let's keep it up and see what else we can find.
Okay, that's everyone we've been assigned. <cf>Let's go back to the "Quartermaster's Pavilion" in Asterleeds.
One more person, Grace should be calling out to you.
Oh?　Welcome back <cf>Did you see the three of us?
Mm-hmm. This one is perfect. <cf>They're probably at the temple by now.
What about you? <cf>Did you find the student you said you would call on?
Yeah, it's him. ...... <cf>He's got a little favor to ask[--].
Haha ...... Mr. Lalaforte ....... <cf>The time we didn't see each other made us love each other. ......
Oops sorry ...... if the singing classes are going to resume, <cf>we'll need something to celebrate, right?
So I thought. <cf>Brightly colored flowers inspired by Ms. Lalaforte: ......
I can describe that gentle voice like melting snow <cf>wonderful flowers ......
It is "Mizushiragiku"! <cf>Let's make a bouquet of it and give it to her!
[--]So, I wonder if you could do me a favor?
You want me to go to ...... and pick some "Mizushiragiku" <cf>, don't you?
Yes, please. <cf>They should be blooming in "Andra Basin" this time of year.
All right, all right. <cf>One more task, my servant.
Oh, that's a magnificent "Mizushiragiku"! <cf>I'm sure Lalaforte will love this one!
Thanks, guys. <cf>Well, I'm off to class!
Thanks for everything. You've been really helpful! <cf>Okay, I'm off to class now.
Oh dear. ....... <cf>Oh well, we'll go check it out.
Thank you! <cf>Thanks to you, we have heard from students one after another!
I will open a class as soon as possible. <cf>I have invited Charlotte to be a special instructor for the first time!
Since we're here, <cf>I hope you guys will join us...
Singing Classrooms ...... Well, that's a nice change of pace. <cf>Let's take a peek.
LOVE!　LOVE!　LOVE!　LOVE!　Lalaforte!
Great today!　Always the best! <cf>Psycho Psycho I love you!
Thanks again for the great calls today! <cf>I'd love to hear everyone's responses.
Oh my god!　Not only Lalaforte, <cf>call me too!
na ......
<span size="Big">What the heck is that? &lt;/&gt;
If it's only for this course, I can sing songs that have nothing to do with the Bapharia religion or <cf>trendy songs with a gun!
Great stress reliever! <cf>Come on, let's all sing along!
Ye[---]☆
Ye[-----]☆
No. ......*
Even the oracle priestess is ....... <cf>Oh no, my head is starting to hurt. ......
Come on, you guys, let's sing and dance!　Let's go!
Yeah, let's have some fun! <cf>Yeah [---] yeah!
yay
Here goes the next song!　Oh, fun!
....... <cf>...... I thought it was something because of all the noise, but it was more than I expected.
Lalaforte asked me to be his singing instructor. <cf>It's a good thing I didn't take him up on this offer.
And I'd rather be reading history books than singing. <cf>Now, the archives stacks: ......
Oh, I found Millene!
Hee!
I'm so glad you came, Millene! <cf>I'm so glad!
Oh, no, I was just passing by and it was different [--].
Oh wow, three divas all together! <cf>The best situation!　Hot!
Okay, we're going into overtime☆ <cf>We'll make you even more captivated by our songs...
Yeh [-----]!
Ye[----]y!
No. ......!
yea
That's why I'm different!
Hmmm!　Singing is good after all!
Haha ...... I'm worried about you ......
Hmm?　What's wrong with your gloomy face? Are you worried about something?
Feste-chan and Hope, isn't it? <cf>...... Speaking of which, you guys are getting along well with the Order these days, aren't you?
Well, I often get requests.
Perhaps you've even met with the oracle priestesses of ...... <cf>?
...... Well, not quite?
I see!　Hey, is the priestess well? <cf>Are you really sick or something?
What is this all of a sudden?
Look, the opening ceremony of the Star Festival. You just had the opening proclamation, right? <cf>Usually there's a talk, but there wasn't one this year.
It doesn't feel like a Seirei Matsuri without that thing. <cf>The priestess looked a little tired when she declared the opening of the festival. ......
There's a rumor going around <cf>in some circles that maybe there's something going on.
I see what you mean. <cf>Well, ...... I think you've just been busy, huh?
It's unheard of to not have a priestess speak at the Hoshirei Festival. <cf>Is there such a thing as being that busy?
Yeah, I'm worried. I knew there was something wrong with <cf>in the skirmish with the principality the other day.
Is he so sick that he can't talk to you? Or is it an injury? <cf>You might want to send something energetic to ......
Calm down!　The oracle priestess is really all right.
That being said... ......
Well, it can't be helped. <cf>I will let them know that you are worried about them.
Please take good care of them. <cf>All the customers who come here are worried about you, too!
Mm-hmm. Then we should go to the temple. <cf>I must let them know that we are all concerned about the oracle priestess.
I'm tired of being tired of being tired of being tired of being tired of being tired of being tired of being tired. <cf>Phew, I'm tired indeed. ......
Woah!　What a pile of gifts!
Oh, this is a tribute to Master Einrain.
People who were concerned about Einrain's health came to <cf>with their sympathy gifts one after another!
We appreciate it very much, but there are so many of them that <cf>it's hard to carry them to the storage place. ......
Muuu....... Apparently, more people are concerned about <cf>Einlein than we think.
[Let's go to the Sanctuary of Blessings. <cf>We must tell Einlein the details of what happened.
How are you doing?　Einrain. <cf>I saw a pile of gifts in the temple earlier [--].
Yeah....... <cf>Everyone seems to be worried about ...... me. ......
Yes, that's right. As a matter of fact, we were asked to check up on you <cf>.
The people of the city seem to think that <cf>the lack of word from you at the Seirei Festival was due to your poor health.
...... physical condition is not a problem
I didn't talk about doctrine because <cf>I couldn't leave here much ......
I sent out a goodnight <cf>to the congregation that always helps me maintain the wards.
I wanted you to at least have fun at the Star Festival. ......
That's why you're spending more time here.
....... <cf>I can't tell everyone about the boundaries and ......
I really didn't mean to worry you.
And yet, I even got a gift ....... <cf>Lugerio says it's good to have your faith confirmed. ......
I feel like I'm fooling everyone. ...... <cf>I'm ......
Do you want to tell everyone at ...... not to worry?
....... If I could. <cf>But Lugerio said, 'Don't say anything unnecessary.' ......
Hmmm. As was the case in the Principality, <cf>it's no problem to leave here for a little while, right?
Yup. And now the congregation is coming back. ......
Then how about a spur-of-the-moment mini-mini story-telling session?
Sudden ...... mini mini ......?
There are many people who would like to hear what you have to say. <cf>Lugerio will not be able to stop them if you do it suddenly in the city.
I want to do that ....... ......
Okay, then what about the location?　Then let's see where we can find a place ...... <cf>to do it with that cook.
He will be relieved when he sees Einlein's <cf>healthy appearance with his own eyes!
What? <cf>The oracle priestess is going to hold a story-telling session here!
Yes. It will be short and secret to the Order. <cf>As long as everyone can see the priestess in good health, that's all that matters.
That's why I'd like to borrow your place for a moment.
If that's the case, you can use the balcony there. <cf>The people outside will be able to see the priestess.
I'm so sorry, but it's a big responsibility. I'm getting the shivers. <cf>I'm sure there will be a lot of people there. ......
Yes, I know!　Maybe we should serve something to the people who gather at <cf>for the priestess's storytelling sessions!
Ahhh!　But I just now got the ingredients ...... <cf>I should have stocked up on more if this is the case!
Well?　If there is anything missing, we will get it for you.
Really?　I appreciate that! <cf>Well, I'll take your word for it, then.
What I especially need right now is meat. <cf>I need you to get me some fresh ones.
Okay, I've got the contract. <cf>In exchange, I'll rent this place for free, okay?
Ha!　You're so solid!　That's fine. <cf>I'm not trying to take money from you, miko.
See this note for the ingredients needed. I'll see what I can do! <cf>Now, we have to get ready to welcome the priestess!
...... Skyfish, shrimp mushrooms and crab spider meat, huh? <cf>Okay, let's get some live ones!
Here, I've got the ingredients.
Thank you, that's very helpful! <cf>Actually, we've already got quite a few people here.
I told only the regulars about the miko's storytelling sessions, but <cf>it went around and quite a few ......
Good, good. It's only for a short time. Besides, it would be more worthwhile for the priestess to have some <cf>people to talk to, don't you think?
Well, we're all set. <cf>Let's get started on our sudden mini-mini storytelling session!
...... so that we do not wake the beast <cf>with daily reflection and compassion ......
I'm so relieved to see you looking so well, miko!
And I was able to listen to a very nice talk in such close proximity. <cf>Anyway, ......
Yeah. But still, it's really [--]
<span size="Big">Boring ......! &lt;/&gt;
...... yes?
But that's good [--].
The boredom of the story itself and the <cf>miracle of boredom produced by the miko-sama's peculiar 'pause'!
It's become a habit. I can't stand it. <cf>My ears, no, I mean my body is asking for it. ......
What a ...... <cf>world we don't want to understand too much ......?
The layman will not understand[--].
OK. I see that Einlein has some strange fans of <cf>stories.
Well, if word gets out that we're having a storytime here <cf>I'm sure everyone will be relieved.
Well, perhaps it's time to ......
What are you doing here! <cf>Mr. Einrain!
I thought it was about time the sentry spotted us! <cf>Let's get out of here!　Einlein, your servant!
Yup!　See you guys at ......!
Wait a minute! <cf>Please wait, Mr. Einrain!
Thank you, miko! <cf>I will let everyone know that you were well!
Well, the priestesses smile in a manner befitting their age, don't they?
That was adorable. <cf>Yeah, but really as I expected [--].
That was a boring story!
Haha ...... I'm glad to hear that the Star Festival went well. ......
Millene is still ......
I came to check on you somehow and found ...... <cf>What's the matter, you look very depressed, don't you?
Oh!　Thank you very much for your help on that occasion. <cf>You were all associated with the Order.
I saw you talking with Mr. Lugerio at the Hoshrei Festival <cf>in a friendly manner.
Familiar is a misnomer. <cf>Well, I'd say they're related, no doubt.
Were you also at the Hoshinrei Festival?
Yes, I am. Even though I've been kept away from <cf>I'm still a bit of a priest myself. Besides, [--]]
I was also concerned about Millene becoming a diva <cf>
...... How is Millene doing since then?
I was hoping <cf>that he would come back here after the Seirei Festival, but there is no sign of that!
Don't worry. I am doing my duty in good health! <cf>Well, in exchange for the books and documents in the temple.
Haha, that sounds like a thing.
I saw her sing at the ...... Star Festival and <cf>it was stunning!
I still think she's going to end up on the ...... singing path!
Wait a minute. I don't think so. <cf>I just can't go back now because I still have work to do.
Diva is a prestigious job. It is different in rank, treatment, and everything else from a <cf>mere historical researcher with no backing!
Ale would be happier living as a diva. <cf>Yes, she would. It must be. No, it must be.
No, no, first check with him to see if he is willing [--].
Could you please pass this paper on to <cf>Millene
This is a joint research project with her, completed by me. <cf>She told me to think of it as a parting gift from her mentor to her apprentice who was moving on to a new path.
Oops, he didn't listen to me <cf>, he just finished it in his own mind.
I've had nothing but debates with that thing when we've seen each other. <cf>I guess that won't be possible anymore.
I'm happy and sad to leave the nest. ...... <cf>Heh ......
Oh, ...... no good, this one. <cf>He's completely in his own world.
We have no choice. I'm going to deliver this paper to Millene. <cf>The only thing left to do now is to let the master and the disciples discuss it.
What's wrong? <cf>The offerings aren't ready yet.
This is a gift from Walken to you. <cf>He told you to consider this paper as a parting gift from your master.
[parting gift]......?
He thought you were going to quit your career as a researcher <cf>and become a diva!
Huh?　Huh? <cf>What is that?　It's not even a good misunderstanding!
I never said anything about quitting my position as a researcher! <cf>I only accepted a diva in exchange for the temple materials!
That's what we said, too, <cf>but it seems that once they get an idea, they go straight to it.
Hah ...... that's so typical of you ....... <cf>That kind of stubbornness shows in his research.
I'm sorry, but you and I will have to discuss this further. <cf>Well then, we'll leave you to it [--].
If this happens, let's examine every inch of this paper thoroughly <cf>so you can get a sense of how serious I am. That's the only way!
So, I'd like to ask you guys to do a quick <cf>field survey, if that's okay.
Wow, master and disciple indeed. <cf>He got me involved so easily!
Because of my duties as a diva, <cf>I can't leave the temple for long periods of time.
So please do me a favor. <cf>I'll sing for the offerings properly. Okay?
...... I don't have a choice. You're in charge.
Thanks!　Well, just a quick look at <cf>I knew I was missing a lot of material here.
I've been talking to the doctor about it for a while, but <cf>it's too dangerous, so I've given up halfway through.
A bossy monster brought it into his den, and I've been having trouble <cf>confirming it for years!
So, please go to a place called "Sophra's Mountain Path" <cf>and collect a little bit of relics!
You're asking a lot of me, but <cf>you said you'd do it, so go for it, servant!
Only because I have faith in your skills. <cf>Best regards!
Alright!　 <cf>You got the relic or whatever it is that Millene asked you to get!
Let's get this to them ASAP.
See, I brought you a relic, just as you wanted.
That's great!　Thank you! <cf>I'm glad I asked for you guys!
Okay, I'll call you when I've finished verifying the paper. <cf>Until then, you'll have to wait a bit.
Pfft ...... with this relic, I'm going to blow away this ridiculous assumption that I'm going to quit being a researcher <cf>
The humiliation of being corrected by an apprentice, <cf>I'll let you have plenty of that, sir. ......
A few days later[--].
Thanks for your hard work ...... <cf>I have finished verifying the paper - ......
You look amazing. ...... <cf>Did you sleep well?
I slept 3 hours in 3 days ...... or ......?
That doesn't count as sleeping!
It's all right. I had done my duty. <cf>Above all, I wanted to clear up the teacher's misunderstanding as soon as possible.
So, yes. Please deliver this corrected and red-covered <cf>humiliation-ridden paper to your teacher!
...... because if you read this, you'll know how serious I am.
It's a complicated master-disciple relationship. ...... <cf>I'll make sure to get it to you. I'll make sure it gets there, so you go to bed.
Yeah ....... <cf>Well then, nice to meet you ~ ......
...... Oh, I forgot. Message to the teacher. <cf>["]............["]]
...... Oh, got it.
...... Yeah, got it.
Please! <cf>A delivery from Millene!
Is this the ...... paper I sent ......?
[He said, "[Read this and you'll know how serious I am.
Mumu...... is it full of corrections? ......
Hmm, I see. ....... <cf>Well, the comparative verification of Document 1 and Document 2 certainly wasn't enough.
Problem with cited material?　Older papers than this are at ...... <cf>Oh, in the closed stacks of the Temple. I can't get my hands on this one.
Mm?　I think Millene would agree that the conclusion is too forced. <cf>What you are saying has a point, but it is only a deduction!
Oh, here and here ......! <cf>Totally, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... ......!
Message from Millene. <cf>[I'll defeat you someday until there's nothing left! ["]"]
I see. Ha ha!　That seems to be the thing!
Apparently I was mistaken. <cf>She never had any intention of quitting her position as a researcher.
I am ashamed of myself for assuming this on my own. <cf>No, I am only sorry.
It's true. Indeed, the master and the disciples are all <cf>in a straight line when they think something is true.
She has her duties as a diva now, but <cf>she's using them for research.
When he has completed his duties, he will return in due course. <cf>Until then, you can wait.
Yes, I agree. But we can't let our hard-working apprentice <cf>master slacken off!
I will wait and prepare a new paper <cf>that I can be proud of her as a mentor!
That's why I'm heading out to do a site survey as soon as possible! <cf>See you soon!
Wait!　You are not to go alone! <cf>You want to get lost again!
The Master will not be defeated, Millene!　When I come back, I will <cf>[beat you to a [complete] pulp!
Hmm?　You are Merlouf, aren't you?
Hey, you guys. You look good.
We met here, but for the hundredth time! <cf>Today is the day I'm going to ask you who you are!
Who are you? <cf>What are you doing here in the first place?
Merlouf, you are [--] yea, you hear me!
Yeah ...... a little quiet. I'm looking for you.
Looking for ......?　What [--]
[--] Found it.
Whoa!　He's flying away again! <cf>Oh, my God, it's always this way!
You said you were looking for ....... <cf>What on earth are you looking for......
I'm curious. I'll try to track it down.
I'm curious. I'll try to track it down.
Mm-hmm. This is a good opportunity. <cf>Let's get a little closer to his true identity!
He flew off into the desert. <cf>I wonder what's out there. ...... I'll be on the lookout!
There he is!　It's Merlouf!
We met here for the thousandth year! <cf>This time is your [--]hmm?
What's with the kid?
Hey, good to see you again.
I saved him from being attacked by a monster.
If you've made it this far, you're all set. <cf>These people will take care of the rest, and they will exterminate the monsters.
Hmmm?　It's admirable that you saved him, but did I say something about <cf>that you didn't want to hear?
So, take care of the monsters. <cf>I'm sure you'll get some good training.
Don't push it so easily!
Oh, you're abandoning us? <cf>What a terrible thing to do to such a lovely little girl.
...... I don't have a choice. I took care of it.
Thank you. You are indeed the bastard child of hope.
You should take a good look at how he fights. <cf>There's a lot to learn from him.
Ha, yes!
Muuu...... I feel like I've been talked out of it, but it can't be helped. <cf>Let's go, my servant!
That's great!　I beat that monster! <cf>That's awesome!　That's so cool!
Oh-ho-ho! <cf>That's what I and my servants can do!
What do you think?　Did you learn anything?
Yes, I want to be strong like him!　I want to be strong like him!
That's a good mindset. <cf>But let's start by protecting ourselves first.
You seem to have some skill, too, <cf>but it's too dangerous to come here alone.
Don't ever misjudge your own competence.
Sorry ......
Why were you alone in the first place?
...... I know it's an excuse, but <cf>we knew it was dangerous!
But I really wanted the herbs that you can only get here <cf>
My neighbor's uncle is suffering from an injury. <cf>I couldn't stand to see that, so I went to ......
Reckless out of the goodness of their hearts or ......
I guess I was just <cf>smug because I'm stronger than the other kids.
If my brother and you guys hadn't come along, <cf>I'm sure I would have died without anyone knowing.
......After all, you couldn't have done anything on your own.
That's how you get strong. <cf>It's important to look at yourself.
Face your failures without turning away from them. <cf>It sounds easy, but it's a very difficult task.
I think it's wonderful that you can do that. <cf>I hope you cherish your honesty.
......, yes!
Well, then, I'll help you with the herbs. <cf>I'll reward you for your honesty.
Wow!　What's wrong with you today? <cf>Each line of dialogue makes my horns itch. It itches!
Huh. Naturally, you guys will help me, right?
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that. ...... Well, it's a boat you're stuck in.
Come on, then, let's all get our medicinal herbs. Let's go for it!
Is this enough medicinal herbs?
Not just enough, but enough change! <cf>This will surely help my uncle's injury!
Yeah, then you can deliver them quickly. <cf>You okay from here on your own?
Yes, and it's just around the corner. While picking medicinal herbs, I also checked <cf>for monsters!
Okay. Well, take care. <cf>I'll see you somewhere else.
Yes, I am!　Thank you all so much! <cf>I'm definitely going to be strong!　Bye then!
Case closed, huh? <cf>You were so kind to me, I was scared.
Switch the response you take depending on the subject. <cf>I'm a [so...][u...][i...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...
Then be nice to us too! <cf>There is such a super beautiful girl!
You have been in possession of a certain amount of power from the beginning. <cf>Then there should be no need for me to respond in kind.
The conversation is not going well with you. <cf>Conversation with you is exhausting.
She was a good, positive ...... girl, but <cf>was she the one you were looking for?
Yes, I know, I'm not sure if I'm right. As a thank you for helping me, I can tell you <cf>
I was looking for that girl[--], or <cf>who has the qualities to be strong like her, I guess.
That boy is going to be very strong physically and mentally <cf>in the future!
You want to help someone, and you are even willing to sacrifice yourself <cf>to do so. That mindset is the first step to being a hero.
To help and guide them, <cf>that's how I travel around.
Is that part of the reason why you are so concerned about us? <cf>You seek "strength" because you want to raise heroes?
You're half right. The other half [--].
[--]Too bad. <cf>I can only answer so much with my work this time!
Oh, this pattern again? <cf>You coward!　Don't fly away [---]!
To lead us to our heroes, or ......
...... Why does he want <cf>so much for a hero?
If that child or servant becomes <cf> strong enough to be considered a hero [--].
What does he want next ......?
Aerinse ...... Mr. ...... that ......
Yes. Yes, sir?
Well, that ...... I ...... <cf>Aerinse's ...... sa, sa, sai ......
Sais?
...... Nah, it's nothing. Excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Einrain!
Einlein ran. <cf>What's wrong?
That's what I don't understand either!
Sometimes I'm approached by people who say oh, <cf>something to me and then they leave, so I ......
What is my ......?
I see. <cf>Perhaps you'd like your autograph?
Oh! Surely it sounded like a signature? <cf>But is it my ......?
Einlein looks like he's <cf>a bit of a snob, but he's also a bit more worldly than you'd think.
The god you believe in is right in front of you. <cf>You might want to get one of his testimonies.
But I'm too thick and embarrassed to <cf>say so ...... and I can't bring myself to say it. Is that about it?
Well ...... if that's the case, <cf>what a cute request!
But are you sure you want me to sign <cf>?
My signature is not <cf>authoritative in any way, but ......
Still, what makes me happy is happy. <cf>That's what longing is all about.
I see. ...... Then, as a token of my appreciation, <cf>I would like to present my signature to Ms. Einrain!
But it would be so quaint if I just wrote it down. <cf>I would like to surprise them with other gifts as well.
Oh, that sounds interesting. <cf>If that's the case, we'll cooperate with you!
Thank you very much. By the way, what is it that Einrain would be <cf>pleased with?
Ummm ...... he likes singing, so <cf>something related to singing would be good?
That's very good! <cf>Now, let's get someone who knows how to sing to help us out!
As for singing, Charlotte and Lalaforte, ...... <cf>they are very close to Einlein.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to talk about it at any moment. If that's the case, [--] <cf>the right person for the job is Millene, who has a good sense of distance.
If you are Millene, <cf>you just went to dinner at the Mermaid.
Mermaids, huh? Okay, let's go.
Oh, there she is. <cf>Millene, lend me a little of your knowledge.
What is it?　Something troubling you about history?
Unfortunately, it's a different matter. <cf>I'd like to ask you a few questions about your singing.
I would like to give a gift of thanks to Einrain for all she has done for me <cf>in confidence!
So, I was wondering if you had any good gifts <cf>that are related to songs she likes ......
I see~. Songs, songs, you know, ....... <cf>Well, the standard is to give away a song you wrote yourself.
And that is indeed a high hurdle. <cf>And sometimes the recipient of the gift is not so subtle.
That would be ...... hmmm ......
Yes, I do!　How about a music box?
Is it a music box ......?
A collection of the latest popular songs. The look and the gimmicks inside <cf>are so cute, they're all the rage amongst girls!
Each one is handmade by Kanaloa's craftsmen. <cf>They are sold out as soon as they come in.
It's what's called a rare item. <cf>Wouldn't you be happy to receive it as a gift?
Good idea, but they sell out quickly, don't they? <cf>I'm not sure how hard it is to get one. ......
If you really want it, it looks like you can go to <cf>directly to Kanaloa to buy it.
I see!　Buying locally is a possibility.
Well, then, let me and my servant go to Kanaloa.
Um, I'm ......?
Mr. Aerinse should stay in the temple. If he disappears, <cf>Mr. Einrain will get suspicious. You don't want to tell her, do you?
Certainly, yes. <cf>Well, I will be waiting for you in the Temple.
Mm. Wait for good news.
Now, where is the rumored music box maker? ......
Hm?　Are you guys here to buy a <cf>music box?
Oh, how did you know!
Lately, all the other people who come here <cf>are just looking for a music box!
But hey, you're adventurers, right? <cf>You've come at the right time. ......
What the heck, maybe <cf>the music box was just finished!
In the meantime, ask the craftsman directly. <cf>He'll be roaring on the beach.
Snarl and ......?
Help him. See you~.
I have a bad feeling about this, but let's go to ...... beach.
Ummmmm ...... how do I ...... ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ......
He's really roaring. ......
Are you the popular music box maker? <cf>We are here to buy a music box.
Oh, wow!　Sorry! <cf>Sorry I missed the delivery date!
No, I wasn't slacking off, I just couldn't get the parts <cf>, so [--]
Calm down!　We are customers!
Heh?　Oh, really. I'm not the head of the company: ......
I'm sorry to show you the embarrassing part. I was on deadline <cf>and couldn't make the numbers, so I was trapped ......
Is it the parts that are not in time?
Yes, we are out of "precision gears" which are essential for making music boxes. We ran out of <cf>"precision gears", which are essential for making music boxes. ......
I asked my adventurers to get a substitute, but they Declined, saying it was <cf>too dangerous. ......
Substitutes?　How do you get them?
I have a <cf>"[PM (proto-machina)] Mook Elder" in a place called "The Abandoned Mines of Miasma",
That guy's parts are made of <cf>just the right gears!
Hmmm... ....... Well, that request, <cf>, we can take care of that for you.
Huh?　Are you sure? <cf>The other party is Machina!
Instead, when you get the gears, <cf>make us a music box before anyone else does.
Yeah, with hazard pay, too, <cf>specially made a little different from the rest, right?
Uh, yeah! <cf>We will do it, please!
If you kill about 3 of the "[PM (proto-machina)] Mook Elder", <cf>you will have enough!
Well, we've come to an agreement! <cf>Leave it to us!
Is this the desired gear?
Oh, here it is, here it is! <cf>Yay, now I can resume making music boxes!
I'll make one for you guys as soon as possible. <cf>As promised, I will make it a bit special!
Yes, it's ready. <cf>How about this way?
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? <cf>Well, this is certainly going to be popular!
Yours is a different color than the regular ones. <cf>This is the only one in this color, and it is a very limited edition!
Mm, I like it! <cf>This would make a great gift!
Well, I'll take it then. <cf>I have to get the numbers before the headmaster arrives!
We must return to Asterleeds. <cf>First, we must deliver this to Aerinse.
Thanks for your time. How did you like the music box?
I got it successfully. <cf>And it's a special edition!
Well, as expected! <cf>I'm sure Mr. Einrain will be very pleased.
Now all that's left to do is to finish it up. I want you to write your signature here <cf>.
I'm kind of nervous. ......
...... Yes, it's done! <cf>It is a music box signed by me!
Well, it's beautifully written. <cf>Let's go deliver it to Einrain right away!
Ms. Einrain. <cf>Could you please accept this one?
What?　What? What?　Why ......
Thank you for all the help you have always given me and I thank you for that. <cf>Hope you like it: ......
Eh ...... Oh, no ....... <cf>Taking care of you is such a normal thing to do. ......
Just take it. <cf>It's not every day you get a gift from God.
Feste and his team have cooperated with us. <cf>So, please accept them.
So ...... then ...... excuse me ......
...... Wow!　This is a trendy music box! <cf>But the color is ......?
It's specially made for you. <cf>And turn it over and look at the bottom.
Bottom ......?　Uh, yeah!
God's signature!
I hope my signature has not damaged the value of the music box <cf>......
That's what I'm talking about: ......!　Thank you! <cf>I can't believe God gave me a signed gift ......!
...... I myself am not such a revered <cf>person!
...... Aerinse?
Certainly, some of the God-families are wonderful. <cf>But ......
As a decorated member of the royal family, I have nothing to be proud of but to live in peace <cf>in my boxy court. ......
...... but Aerinse is here <cf>for the future of the planet!
And now I'm <cf>trying to save my ...... friend, Tyris, because he's ...... trying to save his friend, Tyris.
It's not like I haven't done anything.
Ms. Einrain: ......
Aerinse, who shows us such a figure, ...... <cf>is still my admiration ...... for me!
Ms. Einrain. <cf>Will you be my friend?
Regardless of whether you are a priestess of the oracle or a Bapharia deity, <cf>as a friend, I would like to talk to you!
is ...... yes ......! <cf>But ...... what, talk to ......
Well, first of all, tell us about the <cf>latest popular song in that music box.
I'm not very good at this kind of thing. ......
Yes! <cf>Well, ......, there's three songs in all, and they're all on ......
Good grief, what a pair of tiresome people!
But I'm glad you two became friends.
Yes, I suppose it is.
This song is ...... like this, with a melody like ...... <cf>la~ ...... la~ la~ la~ la~ la~ la~ la~ la~ la
Oh, no!　Einrain, <cf>started singing in a fit of excitement!
Run away, my servant. <cf>If you keep listening to that out-of-tune sound, you'll lose your tune!
(Oh, you can't <cf>run away from your friend's song, you shouldn't ...... do that!)
Oh, behold my servant. Be patient and keep listening to Einrain's song <cf>Aerinse.
That's how I respect friendship. ...... How beautiful. ......
There's a lot to be said for ...... friendship.
There's a lot to be said for ...... friendship.
......That's all for this damage report!
Mm, thanks for your help.
Monsters around the forest are more active than before <cf>
If things continue as they are, there will eventually be deaths. <cf>Before that happens, I would be grateful if you could give me your thoughts on the queen.
However, I am ......
I would like to raise everyone's morale with the Queen's words. <cf>Please, please, let the queen herself give us instructions [--].
...... do as you wish.
Dear Pipimarka: ......
...... We have taken your request. <cf>We will make a decision here in a little while.
Hah ......
You guys are at ....... You've been here. <cf>Did you see the exchange we just had?
Oh~...... sorry. I've come at a bad time.
No, thanks. Whenever you come, <cf>you'll still be exposed to my pathetic appearance.
Pathetic is such a ......
Don't care. <cf>It's even harder when you do.
As I ...... settled down, I had more to think about. <cf>Kapakuku forgave me, but [--].
I have deceived my people for the sake of my daughter. <cf>Am I really qualified to be queen?
I wonder what power there is in my words like that. ......
I'm sorry. If it's not urgent, can we do it later? <cf>I'm a little tired. ......
Master Pipimarka seems to be very tired.
No wonder. After what happened to my daughter. <cf>But I didn't realize he had lost so much confidence.
...... I am also in a position to lead my people. <cf>I understand your anguish, Master Pipimarka.
I'd like to cheer her up somehow. ......
Muuu....... <cf>I'll see if I can talk to Kapakuku about it.
How to restore the Queen's confidence: ......?
Hmmm. Pipimarka seems to have lost a lot of <cf>confidence in his judgment.
Now that the Shinrei thing is over, <cf>it won't be good for the forest people if it continues like this!
...... I'd rather know how to do that than you.
I, as a forest citizen, <cf>would like to support you, Mr. Pipimarka.
But no matter what I say, it will never reach <cf>the back of that person's mind. That One will always be alone.
......I'm not enough to help that man[--].
Don't be so down on yourself!
is ......?
Indeed, the heart of those on top is lonely. <cf>But [--]
If you know that there is even one person who cares for you from the bottom of their heart, <cf>you will not be alone at that moment!
Really, ...... just one person can make ...... <cf>people stronger in a strange way!
(...... This is Aerinse's actual experience, I'm sure.)
Now Master Pipimarka is covering his ears, but if <cf>Mr. Kapakuku does not give up, his voice will surely be heard!
So please don't make light of your existence by calling yourself "like" <cf>
...... extra. However [--]
I'm sorry to say, but you're right. <cf>I'm not even close to realizing it until someone else tells me.
If I don't believe in myself first, <cf>even Master Pipimarka won't believe a word I say.
...... Yes!
Ouch, Kapakuku!　Give me your hand!
There is a monster rampage in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life" at <cf>!
What!　All right, I'll be right there!
Help. The more manpower, the better, right?
I'll help. The more manpower, the better, right?
Yeah, let's be honest and ask for help here. <cf>I look forward to working with you!
Ah, Kapakuku!
They're bringing reinforcements. Where are the monsters? <cf>What's going on now?
The monster is just up ahead. They're pretty tough opponents, man. <cf>Fortunately, no one lost their lives, but ......
Damn!　If the Queen had taken action sooner, <cf>this wouldn't have happened. ......
That's not true!
Ka, Kapakuku?　What's that, suddenly ......
The Queen is only now losing confidence. <cf>Have you forgotten how you have always been?
Even in hard times, He sacrificed Himself for the sake of <cf>our people!
It's ....... And, but she's the queen, right? <cf>You gotta make the right decision anytime. ......
The Queen is not a machine. <cf>She is one forest people with a heart.
Forest people must support each other in times of need
That's ...... even if it's the Queen. <cf>That's how I see it.
I will support the queen. <cf>Consider this fight an expression of that determination!
Wait, Kapakuku!　It's not safe for you to go alone!
Don't worry. We'll go with you. <cf>You guys take care of the wounded first.
Subhumans and humans as helpers?
I wanted to help <cf>Mr. Kapakuku's desire to support the Queen.
It doesn't matter if you are subhuman or human in the mind that thinks so. ...... <cf>I believe so.
Let's go!　If we dawdle, <cf>Kapakuku might go in alone!
Support, or ......
Well, the defeat is complete!
Oh, you beat that thing!　That's just like Kapakuku! <cf>Even without the queen's instructions [--]
No, this is the Queen's order. <cf>The queen said she would leave it to us, didn't she?
I'm not ....... Indeed, you said so, but ......
The queen trusted our judgment. <cf>And I trusted her and moved on. That's all.
Kapakuku......
I support the Queen at my own will. <cf>Not because someone told me to.
This victory is for the Queen, Lady Pipimarka!
Oh my God!　There's a monster over there, too: ......!
Okay, I'll go [--]
No, I'll go. <cf>Kapakuku is the watchman, right?　You guys go back to your hometown.
...... We don't want to be dressed up just for you. <cf>We, too, want to support our queen.
...... Huh, I see.
Let's go!　For our queen and [the township]!
Oh dear. Well, we'll be at the Queen's mansion <cf>waiting for the victory report.
Thank you all for the great job you did in defeating them.
Thank you very much for your kind words.
I'm really ...... giving everyone a hard time.
I'm sure there are many hardships <cf>for someone like me to go through because I am the queen. ......
...... Dear Pipimarka, With all due respect, that's not true!
Kapakuku?　What ......
We fought the monsters because <cf>we wanted to protect this Ulrau Village and--
We are here to support you and to help you <cf>to be free from any sorrows!
Pipimarka must have a strong <cf>idea of what a queen should be!
We cannot deny that we, too, had such thoughts. <cf>But when we realized that even the queen is one forest people, ......
I was finally able to <cf>think about how that thought had been tormenting Master Pipimarka!
We, too, noticed it only after Kapakuku told us.
I thought we were supposed to serve the Queen, but <cf>that's not enough!
We will protect the Queen with our will. <cf>And we must become a people that the Queen wants to protect.
From now on, we will support the queen!
Everyone ......
I couldn't protect [the township (sato)] on my own. ...... <cf>So [--]
To protect this Ulrau Village, <cf>can you help us all?
Of course!
We support the Queen!
A new bond of the forest people, here!
Is it possible to get a case closed at ......?
Yes, I am glad to hear that you are feeling better. I am glad that Master Pipimarka is feeling better.
You guys have helped me out quite a bit. <cf>Now the foresters can start on a new path.
Everyone must feel closer to Master Pipimarka than before <cf>
Yeah? - Yeah.　What's up?
It's nothing!　Nothing, it's just that it's good for Pipimarka to be <cf>close to everyone!　Mm!
Hohoho ......? <cf>Well, let's not be frivolous on this happy occasion.
Hmmm, yes.
What's with that smile? <cf>I'll give you a reward, get the hell away from me!
Hey! I've heard about you! <cf>I heard you had a fight with a dragon tribe at the forest people's place.
[--]!　How did you know that?
There is nothing that this top of the top, Mr. Jake, <cf>doesn't know about!
Well, thanks in part to the connections my father left behind. <cf>My information network has definitely grown since before, right?
Muuu....... You were surprisingly good at it, weren't you?
Oh well. Thanks to your business, we are on the verge of opening our second <cf>coin-operated restaurant!
Oh, I hate this talent that tops everything I do. <cf>God, aren't you creating me too Perfect?
Let's go, servant. <cf>I don't have time to listen to Jake's bragging.
Wait! <cf>Feste's little girl likes to talk about rewards!
All right, talk! <cf>We're on the same side. Let's hear it.
You're right, you change fast when it comes to money. ...... <cf>Well, listen up.
The dragon tribe that showed up at the forest people's place. <cf>We are getting reports of sightings here as well.
There's no major damage, but <cf>my gut is telling me something fishy.
It could affect business. If possible, I'd like to go to the location where the sighting was reported <cf>to check it out in person.
However, it's dangerous to go it alone <cf>against a dragon tribe, even if it's me. So you want a skilled companion.
So that's what you're talking about. Acknowledged.
If it's about the dragon tribe, <cf>we can't just leave it at that.
Thank you! Well, let's get going.
The location is "Mukai Jukai" in Andra Basin. <cf>I'll meet you at the entrance!
I've been waiting for you. <cf>In the meantime, I'm going to check all the way to the back of this thing.
If you encounter a dragon tribe, I will leave it to you to decide whether or not to fight. <cf>Then, tighten up and go!
I agree with bracing yourself, but <cf>do you have any more info on the enemy?
Sorry, nothing except that they seem to be dragons.
I couldn't go through <cf>the Bureau of Reclamation because the information is too uncertain. Besides [--]
In case you're dealing with a guy like Leanbluhm, ...... <cf>a normal adventurer can see the [o(∙)][ch(∙)].
That's why you're here. <cf>We're used to dragon people.
I'm sorry, but you are right. <cf>Considering the risks, it's the right choice.
Don't you agree?　The SAFETY of other adventurers is also <cf>considered, and that's what makes it top of the line!
You guys are strong, but in terms of the real top, <cf>you still have to learn from me [--].
Oh, shit. I carelessly praised him. <cf>His self-esteem knows no bounds.
Servant. Leave Jake alone, <cf>and we'll move on.
Well, watch my back on this survey and learn what it means to be a top <cf>[--]Hey?　Don't leave me!
There was a dragon tribe, but it was a demi-dragon. <cf>There were a few others as well. ......
Why is there a demi-dragon here at ......?
It's strange, isn't it? Well [--]
Maybe ......[so(-)][i(-)][ts(-)] would know what's going on.
That guy?
That's the guy hiding behind the tree over there!
What the ......?　Damn!
Let him go!
Ow, get off me!　You son of a bitch!
You've been watching us fight demi-dragons all along <cf>
You look familiar to me at ....... <cf>That's the guy who used to get in trouble a lot at the Pioneer Station.
We all know how good you are, don't we?　How did you survive with all those demi-dragons wandering around <cf>?
Hmmm... ...... seems to be a tough nut to crack.
Jake, let's take this guy back to the coin pavilion. <cf>This is not the place to continue the interrogation.
Yes, I agree. <cf>You never know when the demi-dragons will come out again.
Come on, get up! <cf>I'm going to invite you to my signature coin-operated pavilion!
Damn it, who talks!　Damn you all!
The adventurer I caught in "Mukai Jukai" <cf>easily cracked when I flashed him some money.
...... that guy was a collaborator hired by the dragon tribe, it seems.
A collaborator?　What the hell for?
He and his demi-dragons were planning an attack on a trading party that was going to and from <cf>around Asterleeds.
...... hiring people, making plans, <cf>such intelligence, demi-dragons don't have.
Oh. Of course, there is a mastermind, a dragon tribe. <cf>His name is [--]
[--]Leanbluhm
The money and goods taken from the merchant corps were contracted to be divided <cf>by fifty-fifty.
Leanbluhm. I thought you had disappeared from the Duchy of Bernhardt <cf>, but here you are in the dark.
It was a good thing I asked for your help. <cf>We could have fought Leanbluhm.
Well ....... <cf>For once I admire your instincts.
Right?　As a top adventurer, my intuition is always sharp at <cf>any time of the day!
You can admire me more, right? Here's <cf>. Don't hold back. Praise is welcome!　Come on!
Damn!　I'm annoyed with that kind of <cf>face forwardness from you!
Feste, your tone is shifting.
Yes! <cf>I feel Respect from Feste's missus ze!
Noooooooo!　Humiliation!　Humiliation!
Hmmm, the raid on the merchant corps was stopped by those guys?
Too bad. I would have loved to have seen Asterleeds fall into <cf>doubt by pairing humans with these demi-dragons.
We don't know who is getting through to us ....... <cf>If we poke around a bit where such fears have risen to the top [--].
It didn't take long <cf>for a city full of adventurers to get there.
With all due respect, sir, I am afraid to say this. Dear Mr. Leanbluhm. <cf>I have been ordered by Mr. Avninte to join you. ......
I'm not his guy. As for Bernhardt, <cf>I only cooperated with him because our interests were aligned.
And yet ...... haha!　It makes me laugh that it's an order!
Rub that cocky [face] on the ground and ask <cf>if I can do you a favor?
...... reply how
No need. Leave it alone.
I'm me, I just do what I want ...... kuku ...... <cf>haha, hahahahaha!
...... yes, thanks for letting me know. <cf>I'll let you know if I need anything else.
What's wrong, Charlotte?　What's wrong? <cf>You look serious. ......
Oh, ...... Yeah, I heard something that kind of caught my attention.
Lately, there have been <cf>frequent monster attacks around Salamzart.
It seems that the level of <cf>reinforcement requests are also coming to the pioneer station here: ......
Speaking of Salamzart, ...... I see. <cf>Your troupe is still stuck there.
Maybe it's the monsters <cf>that make it hard to get out of there.
......I wish I could be there for you at a time like this.
Salamzart, why don't you come with me to Salamzart to see how things are going?
Salamzart, why don't you come with me to Salamzart to see how things are going?
What, ...... good?
Even though she is a Star Spirit Diva, Lalaforte and Millene are both <cf>there, and it wouldn't hurt to get away from the temple for a little while, would it?
Sure, making offerings[--]chronograms to God <cf>is not as busy as it used to be, but ......
I wonder if I can go see you at ......
The armed group has been settled. <cf>No one will complain if you go to meet the troupe.
I see. <cf>I guess it's safe to go see him now.
Well then, I'm going to indulge you guys. <cf>Please escort me to Salamzart!
Oh, I'm in charge! <cf>Well, I'll get paid for it, though, won't I?
Haha, you are so solid. <cf>I'm okay with compensation. I'm getting some money from the Order.
Haha ...... I haven't seen you guys in a while and I'm <cf>starting to get nervous. Hope you're doing well......
Commander!　Everyone!
[--]!　Char!
It's Charlotte!
Oh, it's Char!　It really is Char!
I'm home!　How are you guys?
Yeah, I'm fine! <cf>You're the one who ...... ugh, char ...... be respectable!
You were the diva at the Star Festival. <cf>Congratulations, you did a great job!
Heh heh, I pitched the idea to <cf>and it worked out well.
Your singing voice deserves it. Be proud of yourself.
Everyone in the troupe is happy to have their noses in the air. <cf>After all, one of our own has become a star spirit diva!
Yeah thanks ......
By the way, what's up with that star-spirit diva today?
Perhaps you are back in the troupe!
Oh, um, ...... it's different. I've solved the problem, but I still have my job as a <cf>star-spirit diva to do.
I heard today that there's been a rash of monster attacks <cf>around Salamzart, and people are getting worried.
Then he told me <cf>that these guys were going to escort me. So I came over to see how things were going.
Oh!　You guys are taking care of Char now <cf>
You've met the right one, Char.
Yup!　So, on to the main question: ...... <cf>What are the monster attacks like?
Apparently, they've built a nest near the street. <cf>They attack anything that comes near them indiscriminately.
It's caused a trade stalemate and a shortage of goods. <cf>It's hard to get out of the oasis, and it's a mess.
Even if we ask adventurers to escort us, <cf>a large group like ours would need a lot of people.
I heard through the Pioneer Bureau that <cf>a strike force has been formed. ......
Yes, ......, that's ....... <cf>I think it's faster if you look at it.
We're meeting at the Pioneer Station. <cf>Have a nice day.
I'd love to hear from your escorts as well.
I don't know what's going on, but in the meantime, I can go to <cf>here at the pioneer station, right?
Yes. Because then we'll know why we can't keep <cf>defeating monsters forever. ......
That's why I said no! <cf>That's what I said!
But if we hadn't retreated there <cf>there would have been more injuries!
Hey - what should I do with this equipment?
As far as I'm concerned, the current strategy is too appropriate.
Oh, oh ...... this is stunning ......
It's all over the place. ...... <cf>I wonder if they have a leader.
Oh my, did you guys also come here to see the call for a strike team? <cf>Sorry, we have our hands full with administration right now: ......
No, I'm still considering whether to volunteer. ...... <cf>Which one of you is the leader of this strike team?
That's why our adventurer in the leadership role <cf>left early due to injury!
I was trying to decide who to replace him, but everyone wanted to be the <cf>leader and ...... this is what I got. ......
This is not the way to go about defeating monsters. <cf>Someone has to take the initiative, even if it's by force.
Unless you're an outstandingly skilled person, <cf>the people here are all very good at what they do. ......
I see.　So you want someone with outstanding skills. <cf>Well, we have just the person for you.
Well, before we do that, we need to turn our attention to this one: ......
Charlotte?　What are you [--]
Hey everyone!　It's a special performance by the beautiful diva Charlotte! <cf>I'm going to make you fall in love with me now!
[～～～]♪
Oh?　What is it?
You have a beautiful voice. ......
Cute~!
Thanks for listening to the song! <cf>There is someone I want to introduce to you all today!
What is it?
This adventurer is the liver of Jake, who is a <cf>top of the line adventurer in Asterleeds!
Oh~~!
On top of that, he's a great adventurer who has a good face for the Principality of Bernhardt and has even fought <cf>against the dragon tribe!
Oh~~~!
Oh, I heard about that a while back. <cf>I heard that Asterleeds got a terrific new recruit.
He's been growing his track record at a tremendous rate and ...... <cf>that was him.
I also heard you beat Avaritia!
Yes, you were such a great person! <cf>I would love to have you as a leader of the strike team!
What, yeah?
Please. Do me a favor here. <cf>You're good enough.
Charlotte's strategy won out. <cf>I've come this far, I have no choice but to take the job.
Thank you!　Sorry about that. <cf>I'll make sure to follow up!
Now, please take down the monsters as soon as possible! <cf>The monster's nest is in "[Windsprite's Rostrum]"!
OK, let's all go. <cf>Enjoy my songs on the way!
Woohoo!
Looks like there's a monster's nest in the back here.
Visibility is poor due to sand. ...... If you're not careful, you might get into a fight with each other. <cf>It's not safe to go in with a large group.
Divide them into groups based on chemistry. <cf>So that they can go in at different times.
Let's see, ...... that one was good at close range. <cf>So let's pair him with this one, and the other one is ......
You've already figured out <cf>their characteristics in this short time you've been here?
Yeah, I know. Chat along the way. <cf>A song can bring us closer together.
Ha ha ....... When you said you were a future leader, <cf>it didn't ring a bell, but now that I look at it this way, I see what you mean.
I still can't believe it myself on that one. <cf>These tricks are just like those of the Commander's.
But if it is my future <cf>flesh and blood ......
I wonder if I can go to ...... future and still feel close to <cf>the group leaders.
Charlotte......
No no no! <cf>Now we have to concentrate on getting rid of the monster nest!
Hey everyone!　I'm going to explain the policy now, so listen carefully. <cf>First, we'll break into groups [--].
...... I'm sure he's got a lot on his mind.
...... Okay, everyone's ready, right? <cf>Okay, let's go with the plan!
Good work! <cf>Now Salamzart shouldn't be attacked anymore.
Good grief, I thought I was just coming to check on you, but <cf>I didn't realize you were even going to take down a monster.
I'll give you a special reward there, will you forgive me?
Oh, guys!　Good work everyone! <cf>Hope to see you in the central square later.
My troupe will give an extraordinary performance. <cf>Let's launch there.
He has been in charge for some time now. <cf>You've been made to look good, haven't you?
Come on, let's go back to Salamzart. <cf>We need to let the troupe know we're okay now.
I'm home. <cf>I'm back, and I've successfully defeated the monsters!
Ho, really?　That's great, Char!
These are the ones that are great. <cf>I'm just a follow-up.
Ah, yes, Commander. Can I give a performance to commemorate the defeat? <cf>I've made a promise to the whole defeat squad.
It's not that bad!　Performing because of the raid <cf>wasn't the air, but now I'm not [afraid] anymore!
Let's make a triumphant return to commemorate the defeat of the monster!
Yay!　It's been a while since I've seen everyone on stage!
You, of course, will be there, won't you?　Charles.
...... yeah. <cf>Best regards!
...... Char, you.
You, see: ......
Uh-oh. Yo, yo!　The Jill Wett Traveling Troupe, <cf>is about to begin its first full-member performance in a while!
Hey everyone!　Have a great time today!
Woohoo!　Charlotte-o!
Char-chan~, you are so cute!
Captivate me!!!!
Hey, this is the hottest stage ever! <cf>It's as if this is the last ......
...... Oh, right.
I'm still going! <cf>I'll make you all my prisoners!
That was great, Char. <cf>Maybe it's because you've been a star-spirit diva, but you've become even better at it again.
Hmm, I'm glad to hear you say that.
...... Hey, hey, Char. <cf>You're ......
You ......
...... I know. I know.
Charles. Whenever and wherever you are, <cf>you are our troupe, you are our daughter.
Our hearts are always with you. <cf>Don't forget that.
Commander: ......
I'm sure you'll be fine wherever you go. <cf>Take care of yourself.
...... yeah, yeah. <cf>Thanks ......
Now go. We hope you get to meet your real parents someday. <cf>We hope we get to meet you too!
...... Yes. I'll be there!
...... are we good to go?　Charlotte.
Yes, I have received the feelings of the group leaders well. I've received the Commander's feelings very well.
Let's go back to Asterleeds. <cf>We need to finish the chronogram.
Someday we will go, for the future: ......
(Surprise - Action Scene)
You can find out more at ......
(Action Scene)
Hope ......
Wake up: ......
All to you: ......
Please make this world a better place ......
Stars, the future: ......
Wake up, ......!
(confused) ......
(Running away) ha...... ha...... ha...... ha......
You are persistent!　Give it up already!
(Surprise!) Oh!
What [--]!
Get down!
(Collapses) Ugh!
I didn't think there were others. ......
You are unlucky, too. Well, it's a good thing we met here.
Even I, as you can imagine, can't dream of leaving a man to die.
Give it some time. When I give you the signal, <cf>run past him in one fluid motion. Okay?
...... you?
...... What about you?
Don't worry about it. I'll just run away.
(surprise) Oh ......
You, what [--]
To see and kill is not to dream, right?
To see and kill is not to dream, right?
...... is great!
If you think it's blurry, <cf>you're a moderate user!
Oh, my lord, there's something to see!
Hmm?　What's going on?
Stay with me!　Hey!　Hey!
If you are ......
...... the future ......
Good morning, how are you feeling?
Do you understand me?
Good ......
Well then, let's start over. <cf>I'm Feste!　Nice to meet you!
Remember when you collapsed at the ruins, big brother? <cf>It was so hard to carry him!
Sis, remember when you collapsed at the ruins? <cf>It was so hard to carry you!
That site was only recently discovered and <cf>few others should know about it. ......
Why were you in that place?
Huh?　What should I do? Did you hit your head when you fell down or something? <cf>But I wasn't seriously hurt. ......
Ah, yes, a name!　What's your name?
......[player name]
What else?
I can't remember: ......
That's right ...... you too ......
...... one without a memory is a lonely one...
Actually, Feste can't remember much of the past, either. <cf>So, mates, right?
That's right!　Feste, I can help you get your brother's memory back <cf>!
That's right!　Feste, I can help you get your sister's memory back <cf>!
You saved me at the ruins, right? <cf>So let Feste help you this time?
All right. Once you've decided that, you have to act!
If you feel okay, let's go to that site <cf>one more time. Maybe there will be some clues!
OK!　...... Oh, yeah. Before you go, <cf>can you sign this guestbook for me?
(Buri &amp; wakuwaku) ahehe
Hahahahahaha, yay!
A guest book is a temporary form, and this is a servant contract with me!
You are now my servant from this day forward! <cf>You will work hard and reduce my debt!
What the ......!
You had a very good arm, you know. <cf>I thought it would be a shame to let him go.
Let me introduce myself once again. <cf>I am Feste, or as I like to call myself, the eternally beautiful girl.
Don't worry. It's true, I can help you find clues to your memory at <cf>. And while we're at it, right?
Then go, my servant! <cf>A treasure awaits you that you have not yet seen!
...... and well, so nice to meet you, ahem*.
Well, first of all, let's say hello to the innkeeper.
They carried you out of the ruins. <cf>You should at least thank him.
Your husband is downstairs at the counter.
Oh, you're finally awake. <cf>How's it going?　I hope my bed was comfortable for you.
I am the owner of this restaurant [--] "The Two-faced Coin Restaurant. <cf>I am indebted to you in many ways.
Really. I'm starting to lose track of how much you're <cf>doing to pay the bill.
Ho-ho-ho, okay, just forget about it.
This time, it's one more order of magnitude.
Damn it, you miser.
Which is it? Damn, you're so blinded by money <cf>that you're stupid enough to go to those ruins alone.
I was so worried about such an idiot that I came all the way to check on him <cf>I wonder which good-natured husband he is~?
(Figure) -- ......
Hmph! <cf>If they die, they won't pay the bill!
You're not being honest. You should have told me <cf>that you're in love with this Feste girl.
(Duh) hah ......
Well, don't worry!　From now on, <cf>this servant will earn his money by putting his body on the line.
(I'm surprised that it's so self-indulgent.) What?
You've got your eye on a tough guy, too. ...... <cf>This guy is older than he looks, and older than he is.
What is your husband talking about? <cf>I don't understand Feste!
(Dumbfounded) Huh~!
Are you going somewhere now?
Yeah, I know. His memory is a little suspect, so I'm <cf>looking for clues.
Well, ....... Be careful. <cf>It's dangerous out of town.
If your memory is drowning, be more vigilant. <cf>Listen to your surroundings and don't be unprepared.
Here in Asterleeds, <cf>the largest commercial city in the neighborhood. There is nothing you can't get here.
If you are interested in the store, you can check it out at <cf>
And there's also a <cf>"Pioneer Bureau" where adventurers Accept requests.
Anyway, it is a big city. <cf>Take your time and get used to it.
Outside that gate is a world inhabited by monsters. <cf>Know that once you cross it, a battle awaits you.
Now, before we head out of town, <cf>we have one thing to prepare for.
First, let's head to "Gaimon Plaza". <cf>At the gate we saw earlier.
No need to rush. <cf>I don't mind if you take a look around town first.
This is the Gaimon plaza.
Now, before we leave, let me tell you one thing.
The device in front of us [--] <cf>is called a "Transfer Portal".
It is an excellent tool that allows you to return instantly to wherever you are!
We'll get it working as soon as we can.
It's easy. <cf>All you have to do is touch it gently.
These portals are located all over the world. <cf>Be sure to use them when you find them!
Then, once you've touched it, you're off on your adventure!
This is the Asteria Plain. <cf>This is the richest grassland area on the southern tip of the Magna Continent.
You can find all sorts of useful things, and <cf>Bapharia's ruins lie here and there.
Maybe you'll find a clue to your lost memory.
The ruins where I met you are over there. <cf>You should go there first.
Recently discovered and not yet hand-picked.
But since you were at ...... such a place, <cf>you must have been very well informed?
Don't force me to remind you now. <cf>Anyway, let's go!
Damn!　I didn't realize what I had done!
Go, my servant. Kick them to the curb!
Hohoho. I was not mistaken. <cf>You are very good at what you do!
Now, the place where you fell down was back here, wasn't it? <cf>Let's go check it out!
It's around here: ......
Hmm?　 <cf>Something fell down there. ......
The Imagine Seed. <cr>
What, you forgot about Imagine Seed too? <cf>This is a very troublesome amnesia. ......
Is that clear? <cf>An Imagine Seed is a crystal of will.
The "Engram" [--] <cf>that all things living on this planet have, and a strong will acts on this and materializes it.
That's the Imagine Seed. So far so good, right?
Imagine Seeds can draw various powers by pouring their owner's engrams <cf>
Well, it can't hurt to have it. <cf>Now, is there anything else that might give us a clue?
Well ...... we have no choice. I'm going back to Asterleeds. <cf>We can't stay long in a dangerous place.
Wow! I never thought I would meet you at a newly discovered site. <cf>You still have a good nose, don't you, little subhuman girl?
That's Jake. <cf>He is the "self-proclaimed" top adventurer in Asterleeds.
I'm very flattered by the compliment. Though "self-proclaimed" is superfluous.
I am sorry, but we have already been through these ruins. <cf>Latecomers should go home.
What did you say?　What monster was inside?
I'll have you know that in a moment.
I'm sure it was nasty there in the preliminary survey. ...... <cf>Did you take it down?　All by yourself?
Good! That's great!　You don't look like you're from around here. <cf>New to Asterleeds?　Are you a registered adventurer?
I haven't yet. ...... <cf>What is it, you're gonna talk to me?
Yeah, competent guys are always welcome!
Hey, rookie. <cf>If you're willing to sign up as an adventurer and Accept requests [--].
I suggest you come to Master Jake for help. <cf>You are always welcome.
I'm at the Pioneer Station. <cf>Visit me when you're ready. See you later.
Hmmm, he's still a raging bitch.
Well, with him around, <cf>adventurer registration should be a piece of cake.
It's a bit annoying, but he's in Asterleeds <cf>and he's sort of the organizer of the adventurers.
Perhaps it is fortunate that we met here. <cf>You have a lot of 'stuff', don't you?
Is that okay?　You may be concerned about your own memory, but <cf>first you must have the means to make a living.
What is needed for this [--].
It's all there: ......
If you are good enough, you can earn money as an adventurer. <cf>To do so, you must register with the Pioneer Bureau.
Besides, that's where all the information is. You may eventually come across something that connects to your memory <cf>
Once that's decided, we have to act! <cf>I'm off to the pioneer station to see Jake.
Oh, yes! <cf>This is the time to use spatial transfer to get back to the city!
See, you can use the transfer portal <cf>when you leave town, right?
It's convenient to get back to your home quickly. <cf>You'd better get used to it while you can.
This is the "Pioneer Bureau". <cf>This is an organization that supports adventurers from all over the world.
It's a bit formal to say [--], but <cf>well, it's kind of like a job referral agency.
If you become an adventurer, <cf>you'll be able to Accept requests here and make some money!
Hey! Welcome aboard, rookie. Welcome to the club.
To become an official adventurer here in Asterleeds, you must take the <cf>exam and register with the Pioneer Bureau.
You are now "provisionally registered" with me as your nominee.
I will now ask you to Accept the request as a registration test. <cf>Think of it as a test of your skills as well.
They said that if you successfully fulfill the request, you'll be 'registered'. <cf>How it works sa
For more information, ask the Hot and Cute information lady. <cf>Myulie, Come on!
You must be the newcomer. <cf>I'm Myulie, the general information clerk. Nice to meet you.
Well, let me start by explaining this pioneering station at <cf>
Various requests come in from all over the country. <cf>Anything from exterminating monsters to finding what you're looking for.
When you Accept and accomplish a request, you will be given a reward. <cf>The harder the request, the better the reward.
That's all for the basic explanation. <cf>So let's get started with the registration exam, shall we?
You don't have to be so hard on yourself. <cf>I'll make sure you get a request that matches your abilities.
Oh?　Isn't that an Imagine Seed you have at <cf>?
I picked it up at Cliffside Ruins. ...... <cf>We're not very familiar with it.
Can you show me something?
This can be found at ......
Goblin Battle Imagine.
Damn, goblins. ......
Oh, ......? <cf>This is ready to go right off the bat.
How lucky you are to have picked it up in this condition. <cf>Please put it to good use.
Then let's start the registration test. <cf>Talk to me when you are ready.
If you become an adventurer, I'm sure I can get you a good job at <cf>one of these days.
Well, it's a good deal! <cf>You don't have to say two words, do you?
Of course! That's why you have to pass the exam <cf>easily!
I'm looking forward to adventures with you too. <cf>Good Luck! Do your best!
Accepting the Adventurer Registration Exam?
OK. <cf>Um, your nominator was Jake. ......
He has already defeated goblins with ....... <cf>So, I guess it's enough to confirm my ability.
Now, let me explain about the test
You are now headed to <cf>to investigate the dungeon.
In Asteria Plain, in the Skyquake Fields, there is a place called <cf>"Reikrid Tunnels".
Reikrid Tunnels. <cf>That's an old mine, isn't it?　I hear the name sometimes.
More precisely, the remains of a former mine shaft. <cf>Explore there and reach the deepest point.
Actually, after it was closed, the monsters took up residence. <cf>The danger isn't that great, though.
The Pioneer Bureau is monitoring it, and I just thought I'd <cf>use it to test the new guy's skills.
Oh, wow. You're thinking rougher than I thought.
I'm not sure how much I'll be able to do. As adventurers, we need you to overcome this much difficulty <cf>on your own.
So, the search for "Reikrid Tunnels" will be the <cf>Adventurer Registration Test!
Jake is the one who approved and I have high hopes for you. <cf>Good luck!
Over there, there is a place where engrams are spewing out of the ground. <cf> That's the marker.
It's called a "star vein hole. They are connected to ruins and caves. <cf>If you find one, remember where it is.
The Reikrid Tunnels are connected to <cf>through a star vein hole here.
So, let's go in. Myulie said it's not that <cf>dangerous, but ......
It's a place to see how good a newcomer is. <cf>You have to anticipate a problem or two.
Are you ready? <cf>Don't worry if it's you, but be on your guard!
Well, back here ...... <cf>you may have a tough opponent[--].
Do not be afraid. <cf>Together we will make a name for ourselves!
You say that's an ...... ogre?　 <cf>I never heard of an ogre!
...... surprised me. <cf>That was an ogre, wasn't it? ......
I didn't know they were going to have something like that! <cf>I thought it was just Mook at best: ......
Even if it's part of the exam, <cf>it's probably too tough for a fledgling.
Well, you've beaten me. <cf>That's my servant!　I commend you!
This should be the end of the test. <cf>Now, let's report back to Myulie with an open mind!
Welcome back. We've been waiting for you.
From the looks of it, ......, it went well. <cf>How did you like the Reikrid Tunnels?
That's what I'm talking about. <cf>I think it's a little too difficult, no matter how much the test is.
I didn't hear anything about an ogre! <cf>I'm sure they're too tough for a novice.
An ogre?　What are you talking about? <cf>I didn't Accept that report.
What, it wasn't part of the exam?
Of course. There's no way I'd let a dangerous monster like an ogre <cf>into my exam project.
...... hmm?　Eh, wait a minute. <cf>Maybe you've defeated an ogre!
Oh, that was indeed a challenge. <cf>Oh, my dear servant.
Eh!　Really! <cf>Even adventurers can have trouble with these monsters!
Anyway, there's an ogre in the Reikrid Tunnels, isn't there? <cf>I'll call upper management right away!
Fu ....... Thanks for your patience. <cf>In the meantime, I've sent out a survey team to "Reikrid Tunnels".
By the way, ...... you are amazing. <cf>I can't believe you beat the Ogre out of nowhere.
People were amazed. <cf>I thought, "Who knows, maybe someone will join us!　They said.
Eh, ahem!　Right?　Right? <cf>Well, I was the one who spotted it first!
So, what about the important test?
Of course, congratulations. <cf>You have passed the Adventurer Registration Exam!
The Pioneer Bureau welcomes newcomers. <cf>We're counting on you and glad you've joined us.
Now you are an adventurer. <cf>From now on, you can Accept requests from the Pioneer Bureau.
You did it!　You did it! <cf>Let's go out there and make a lot of money!
Earn money, but don't forget to increase your <cf>"Adventurer Rank"!
Adventurer Rank?
How skilled and strong are you as an adventurer and how far are you willing to go <cf>to overcome the dangers? Those are the overall indicators.
If you complete certain "Adventure Boards", you can go to <cf>me and I can process your rank up.
Hmmm at ......?　What's in it for me if I move up the ranks <cf>?
Of course!　For example, you can Accept more remunerative requests at <cf>or
Some facilities that work with the Pioneer Bureau are being released, <cf>and some places you have to reach a certain rank to get to.
Really?　That's something to look forward to.
Right?　Okay, I'll give you the first adventure board at <cf>
If you have any questions, give me a shout at <cf>
Oh, yeah! <cf>And then there was a special bonus for you.
What?　A special bonus*? <cf>That's outrageous!　That's a bit of a misnomer, that's for sure!
You took down the <cf>ogre in "Reikrid Tunnels," didn't you?
As a reward for providing this important information and taking down the attackers, the <cf>Pioneer Bureau will present this to you!
This is Glory Coin. This is a "GC". <cf>You can exchange them for all sorts of things at the Souvenir Exchange.
Not only will you find useful items for your adventures, <cf>but you will also find unique outfits.
I hope you'll take advantage of <cf>"GC" as much as you can, because your appearance is also an appealing point for adventurers!
The memorabilia exchange is at the counter to the right as you face me. <cf>It's right there, so please take a look!
Costume. You don't see many of them in regular stores, so <cf>might be a good place to get them.
You've taken care of a lot for me. <cf>Thank you, Myulie.
You are welcome. So, thank you for your continued support of the <cf>Development Bureau!
Congratulations! <cf>You're finally an adventurer!
Then, as promised. <cf>I'll get you a good paying job.
Oh, I've been waiting for you! <cf>That's the way, that's the way!
Oops, looks like you're still at rank '1'. <cf>I'm going to have to go with "2" or higher, or we'll never talk about this again.
We're going to a bit of a tricky place. <cf>I'm requiring Adventurer Rank 2 or higher.
If you clear <cf>the adventure board you get when you pass the exam, you can move up to the rank of "2".
Unnunu...... is not impatient!
Sorry! <cf>I know you're good at what you do, but that's not the same thing.
Once the Adventure Board squares are filled, you can go to <cf>and report back to Myulie.
She'll show you the steps to rank up ze. <cf>In some cases, there's a Battle there.
All right!　This can't go on, my servant. <cf>Put away your adventure board quickly!
Let's hear the details of that "good-paying job" at <cf>
As a matter of fact, a little something bad has appeared in the "Dragon Claw Valley" northeast of here: <cf>
You and I are going to take him down. ......
Wait a minute. <cf>Didn't you just say "Dragon Claw Valley"?
You don't think it's related to the dragon tribe, do you!
I hear that they are attacking Bapharia's holy places all over the <cf>world without regard!
I don't want to deal with those ferocious people!
Wait, Wait! How can you offer such a dangerous request to a rookie <cf>?
The target is not a dragon tribe. <cf>Eyewitnesses say it's a boar-like beast.
Hmmm ......
Rookies have a lot on their plate, don't they? <cf>Especially if that little lady is around.
You really are a meddler, aren't you? <cf>If only Myulie could see that you are so good at taking care of him. ......
What? <cf>Did she say something about me?
Well, there's no harm in Accepting. <cf>Seriously, I appreciate a good reward.
OK, we have a deal. <cf> We'll see you there, buddy.
By the way, what did she say about me?
We'll meet there. <cf>All right, let's get ready and go!
<span size="Big">Oh, hey ......wait! Please!
I've been waiting for you. <cf>You're with me from here on out.
I'll show you. <cf>I'll show you what a top of the line fight is!
Servants, steal all the skills you can. <cf>Stealing is free.
I can hear you!
Oh, well. If it makes you a better adventurer, <cf>I'll make a way for you.
That's a reliable thing to say. <cf>If you have any advice for my juniors, I'm listening, okay?
Yes, ....... The Dragon Claw Valley is <cf>one of the biggest Bapharia ruins around.
It is probably at a higher level than "Reikrid Tunnels". <cf>The monsters inside are powerful and numerous.
It's important to Check your 'skills'.
Hmmm... skills.
The degree of difficulty varies greatly depending on how you handle your skills. <cf>It is not only about you, but also about the safety of your companions.
If you can't make the best move when the time comes, <cf>you'll ruin your reputation as an adventurer.
Skills, Imagine, Items. <cf>Let's prepare for the Challenge!
That was more sound advice than I expected. <cf>Well, that's what makes you Jake, isn't it?
You have been taught well. <cf>Do not neglect to check your skills, my servant.
All right, let's go then. <cf>The target is just down the hall!
All right, let's get fired up and charge!
(surprise) ......!
This guy ...... no way!
[--]No, don't worry about it! <cf>Concentrate on defeating them now!
You're amazing!　You're just what I expected of you!
But ...... bad. That was stronger than the info. <cf>This is my fault for not casing it.
What's the matter, girl?　You don't look so good, do you?
......I didn't think so, but ......
...... This one is "Avaritia".
Haha, you're joking too hard. <cf>Avaritia is the monster in [adventure story], right?
That's the thing, right?　You know, the one where you're guilty of disobeying God, but you're still alive <cf>transcending time and space ......
It's that strong. It must be Abaritia.
...... You beat that guy, didn't you? <cf>Who the hell are you?
I'll soon run out of things to teach them. <cf>I'm glad to see that I'm such a reliable junior!
Anyway, I'm going home first.
I hope it's just one avaritia, but if <cf>others show up, we need to warn the town.
See you [--] oh!　Come to the pioneer station later. <cf>I'll pay you exactly what you owe me!
Is that ...... what you mean ......?
Hmm?　What's wrong?
(notice &amp; surprise) Oh, ......
Bibbibi, you scared me! <cf>What are you?　Didn't you just fly out of the sky?
Are you a ......[visitor]?
Laijia?　What's that?
This "shimmering" is from [raija (来者)] at ....... <cf>No, but ......
Do you know anything about it?
Do you know anything about it?
...... for that ...... yeah ......
......It's too early to make a decision, or
Hey there!　Who are you? <cf>You've been mumbling incomprehensible things for a while now!
......Yes, that's right. I'll at least give you the name. <cf>We might be friends for a long time to come.
My name is Merlouf. I'm just a wanderer.
well then ...
But he was a strange one, wasn't he? You know what? <cf>When you get tangled up with people like that, just ignore them, okay?
Don't let a little kindness go unnoticed. <cf>You will be taken advantage of.
Why are you staring at me?
Anyway, he said something about ......[Raija], didn't he?
[来者(来じゃ)]......[来者(来じゃ)]...... I think I've heard of this ....... <cf>......Ah no, I can't remember!
Anyway, there it is. I've got to get <cf>Jake's reward before I forget!　Let's go!
Hey, good job! <cf>This is your reward. Take it.
By the way, I got some interesting information from ....... <cf>I'll pass it on to you guys.
I've been re-checking the <cf>unidentified creature sightings that have been rumored in various areas in recent days [--].
There's quite a bit of information at <cf>...... that speculates that maybe it's avaritia.
Law ......
And one more thing.
That spike in sightings coincides with the time <cf>when the dragon tribe started rampaging.
Hmmm... ....... <cf>It's a bit tricky to put it aside as a coincidence.
I hear that the dragon people, unlike before, <cf>were terribly organized.
I don't like to imagine too much. ......
...... someone came out on top. <cf>It also has the power to unite [my] strong dragon clans. ......
Well, this doesn't prove that the Dragon People and Avaritia are <cf>related [--].
I'm going to keep exploring.
Let me know if you guys get any info.
Oh yeah, and you should get a new weapon in case you run into them. You should get a new <cf>weapon in case you run into them, right?
That said, I have a question. <cf>You don't know the word [raija], do you?
No?　Never heard of it?
Mu...... right......
But more importantly, there's that thing, see. About Myulie, <cf>...... what did he say about me, see?
Oh, yes. <cf>["]Jake's hot eyes are ......["]"]
You're looking at ......!
With this reward, I can only teach you so much. <cf>So long, my friend.
Hey, wait a minute!
Ho-ho-ho. A woman's secret is expensive, you know. <cf>And at market value.
Please see ......!
...... Oh yes. You should go to the Coin Pavilion. <cf>The owner said he would buy you a drink to celebrate the accomplishment of your request.
What the hell?　Don't say that kind of thing too soon! <cf>All right, let's go to the coin pavilion, servant!
Oh, what's up?
<span size="Big">I came here because I heard they were going to buy me a drink! &lt;/&gt;
What are you talking about?
I was told you were coming to pay the <span size="Big">bill&lt;/&gt;?
I hear they're going to turn <cf>all the rewards this time around to pay the bill. Oh no, that's great!
Who is it?　Who told you that bullshit?
Jake. I'll pay you well, <cf>I've been told to feel free to rip you off.
Damn ......!　He set me up, didn't he?
Come on, come on, come on, I paid. You've got to give up. <cf>Or I won't let you use this place anymore.
...... Oh, yes. <cf>Before that, have you ever heard of the word "raija"?
Yeah?　[Raija?
Apparently, it might be a clue to the servant's memory <cf>
Heh, that's a clue. ...... <cf>[Raija]...... or ......
Wasn't that something from the Bapharia religion?
Bapharia Church: ......
Fortunately, there is a large temple of the Bapharia religion in this city. <cf>Go there if you care to.
But still, there are so many strange things related to Bapharia religion in Avaritia, [Raija], ...... <cf>
...... ha!　Hey, hey, hey! <cf>Pay the bill and go [ooo]!
Um, are you a priest? <cf>I'd like to ask you a few questions: ......
Oh, it is unusual for a subhuman young lady to come to the temple. <cf>Are you interested in the Bapharia religion?
Bapharia is open to a wide range of people, even subhumans. <cf>If you want to talk to us, you are more than welcome.
Thank you very much! <cf>Do you know the meaning of the word "[raija]", Priest-sama?
[raija]...... Oh, this is a very old word again!
You know it!
I know. <cf>But I am a little hesitant to answer.
What?　Why not, <span size="Big">Stingy! &lt;/&gt;
Keh, call me stingy: ......
[Raija] is one of the most difficult words in the doctrine. <cf>It is not something that should be spoken carelessly.
That is exactly the kind of ...... that is not immune to controversy, depending on the interpretation. <cf>All I can say is this.
Sorry, subhuman lady. <cf>I have some business to attend to, so here it is: ......
Muuu......
Oh boy. Is there some kind of cult <cf>word you don't want to be mentioned too much?
But as for us, we're curious and ......
Hmm?　Hey there, girl. What do you want from us?
...... you are, are you?
Yeah? - Yeah.　You know him?
Hmmm......... Well, okay. You must be a member of the <cf>cult, judging by your clothes, right?　[Do you know anything about the Raija?
『Minsterhorn......』
If you go to Minsterhorn, <cr>maybe you can find out: ......
Minsterhorn, huh? But was there anything there that <cf>could be a clue ......?
Well, let's give it a try. Shall we try it?
Tell me [--].
(surprise) ah...... ugh!
What a strange girl. ......
Hi, I'm looking for some information on [raija]!　Does anyone around here know more about [raija] <cf>?
[Raija?　Then that's my teacher's specialty. <cf>I'm kind of out of town right now. ......
You guys are adventurers, right?
Just in time. My name is Millene, <cf>and I was wondering if you could get me one job.
I'd like you to go find that very teacher at <cf>......
All right, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.
I understand. I'll take care of it.
Thank you!　That's very helpful!
We have questions too, so don't worry about it. <cf>By the way, who's the teacher?
Dr. Walken, a Bapharia priest of the third rank.
He's a priest of the Order and a historian who studies the <cf>history of the Bapharia religion.
Well, that research went too far, and I was sent to <cf>here, didn't I?
Let's leave it at that for now. My teacher, like me, <cf>is a real sucker for anything related to history.
We're going to do another ["] field survey! ["]] and flew from here to <cf>the Giant Tower Ruins [--]].
They haven't come back after the scheduled date. <cf>So I was just about to submit a request to the Pioneer Bureau.
Dr. Walken is all about research. <cf>I'm not sure how flattering it is to say that he can exercise.
I was worried that if <cf>we were attacked by a monster while we were preoccupied with our research ......
Okay, I understand. Don't worry about your sister. <cf>This super beautiful girl, Feste-chan, will find it for you!
Thank you!　Super beautiful girl Feste!
So, let's go, servant. <cf>Find them quickly!
Oh, God!　Please help me!
(Noticed)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　Let's help him!
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your help. <cf>God bless Bapharia for this.
You must be Walken. <cf>Your disciples were worried when you didn't come back.
Oh, you met that thing. <cf>It seems I've caused you some concern.
It's a bad habit of mine, and while I was engrossed in the research, I went <cf>too far into the back of the house.
I found myself completely surrounded <cf>by enemies. No, it was a terrible blunder.
But this is how I live. <cf>This is also the result of my thick heart of faith in the Bapharia religion [--].
Yes, that's it!　We are here to ask about <cf>matters related to the Bapharia religion!
Can you tell me a little bit about the word "[raija]" at <cf>?
Oh!　You guys want to ask about [raija]? <cf>This is a good point!
[The word [raija] is found in a small part of the ancient texts of the Bapharia religion <cf>.
The word originally meant "Gentiles. <cf>In ancient texts, Gentiles are considered to have special powers.
Using this special power, the Gentiles ......[raija] followed <cf>around one by one!
But because of their power, [raija] were considered heretics in ancient texts and were sometimes regarded as <cf>plaguers!
But!　I find a contradiction here!
When we read the descriptions related to the [Raija], we find that they have much in common with the founder of the Bapharia religion in terms of their power and knowledge <cf>
In other words, the founder of Bapharia was one of the [raija], and <cf>other raija lost the power struggle with the founder and were stigmatized [--].
Wait a minute. I can't <cf>get my head around it if you suddenly start talking about it!
Uh ...... you mean [raija] refers to gentiles and <cf>they have special powers ...... and?
Yes, it is!　And the founder of the Bapharia religion is also likely to be <cf>[raija (来者)]!
Here I proposed a further new theory!
The special power that [raija] possesses, it is not divine power, etc. <cf>but further knowledge beyond our knowledge, i.e. ......
<word size="Big" id="来者(らいじゃ)"/><span size="Big">is a human being from another world! &lt;/&gt;
No, no, no, that is indeed a leap too far. <cf>Moreover, that theory is subtly undermining the founder, isn't it?
Ah ...... I see. I think I know why you were sent to Minsterhorn <cf>
I am!　Because I have faith in the Founder and in God! <cf>I only want to reach the truth!
And yet the priests, who were too stupid to understand this, kept me away and forbade me to enter <cf>any religious site!
Oh, ...... yes, that's right. Especially the "Pillar of Divinity"! <cf>I couldn't even get in there, where the founder suddenly appeared. ......
If we could investigate the "Pillar of Divinity" in detail, we might be able to find evidence that the founder was a [raija] ( <cf>)!
Pillar of Divinity" ......
There must be a secret in [the Mihashira]! <cf>Even if it shakes the very foundations of religion, I [--]
I understand your passion. I understand your passion.
Go home for now. See? <cf>Your apprentice is worried about you.
Oh, yes, it was!　Ale and I had an appointment to discuss ancient civilizations at <cf>!
Ha ......, he used to talk a lot.
Now, I would like to go to "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>right away, but ......
In the meantime, I'll have to report back to my client at <cf>
Oh, you guys, thanks! <cf>As you can see, the doctor's back.
And then the discussion started right away [--].
The more I look into that "Giant Tower Ruins" the more interesting it is. <cf>Don't you think so?
So, sir. <cf>How many times have I told you that that tower is the tomb of the Bapharia civilization [--].
That's not right! <cf>Why would you determine that that was a tower in the first place!
The shape is indeed a giant tower. You could call it that. <cf>But some people believe that it is actually a huge cannon!
Isn't that just what the teacher says?
There are also traces of something that looks like it was shot out! <cf>And from the angle, there is a heavenly crest at the end of it!
What does that mean: ....... In the past, man tried to attack the God of <cf>Bapharia!
That's the kind of thing you say out loud, and that's why they move you to the left.
Now let me get back to you. If that was a cannon, <cf>where did the people who built it go?
If they can build such a huge weapon, <cf>the technology must have been passed on to the modern world!
No matter how much civilization collapsed and technology regressed, <cf>those ruins are far from modern technological standards!
It is the same in terms of architectural technology. <cf>It is inconceivable that a building of that size could have been built by man.
Then, that is clearly a relic of the Bapharia civilization. <cf>And the tall tower is of great symbolic importance.
Both the "Pillar of Divinity" and the temple of Asterleeds <cf>are important facilities of the Bapharia religion, many of which boast of their "height".
In other words, "height" is the symbol of authority. The ancient ruling class <cf>built tombs that reached to the heavens to support [--].
Gunnu...... my disciple, but <cf>a brilliant rebuttal that even takes into account the cultural background......!
No, we cannot fall behind here! <cf>Humans and the gods of Bapharia have a history of fighting [--].
Not only historical events, <cf>but also the lives of the people of that time are hints[--].
Oh dear........., so there is this master and this disciple. <cf>They both can't stop talking once they get going.
I can't listen to this. <cf>Anyway, I'm glad you're not hurt.
Now, we are going to <cf>"Pillar of Divinity" to find out the secret of "The Raija".
The place is "Bahamar Highland". <cf>There are much stronger monsters than here!
Are you ready for this?
All right!　Then let's go!
What do you want?　This is the "Pillar of Divinity. <cf>It is a sacred place of the Bapharia cult and is strictly controlled.
No one is allowed to pass through <cf>without permission!
Wow, it was such an important place! <cf>No wonder it was such a magnificent ruin!
Your <cf>uncle must be amazing to be the gatekeeper of such a place!
Hmm?　Oh, yeah?
<span size="Big">Yeah!　Cool~☆&lt;/&gt;
Ha, ha, not so much. Well, only the best of the Order are appointed to this <cf>role, right?
After a rigorous screening and battle, I finally won it. <cf>Well, it's no big deal, right?　Ha ha!
<span size="Big">Wow, lovely!　I adore it&lt;/&gt;.
Haha, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Hey, Uncle? <cf>May I take a look inside for a minute [--]
What a cheapskate! <cf>It's only a little bit!
I told you.　It's a very important site, you know.
This is the holy place where the founder of our Bapharia religion is said to have <cf>first landed!
Did you think it would be so easy to pass <cf>just because you were happy to receive some praise?
So how do I get in?
That's what I'm talking about. Not without the permission of the chief priest class.
Come on, you get it now, don't you?　No matter how you try to <cf>enter, you will never get in. You'd better leave as soon as you can.
Tch...... can't help it. Once we're around "Larpal" <cf>we'll settle down and have a strategy meeting.
...... Servant. <cf>Don't you find something strange and noisy?
In times like this, I don't hesitate to ask around!
Hey, hey, what happened?
Oh, there's a Bapharia pilgrimage group nearby.
Huh?　Even though it's not time for pilgrimages yet?
You know that strange monster that attacked "Berkmar" recently? <cf>They came to mourn the victims of that attack.
I'm told there's even a Priestess Lugerio, the Chief Priestess, and <cf>Einrain, the Priestess of the Oracle, who we don't usually see!
What do you think? <cf>Why don't you go to Bergmar and see if it's a good idea?
With my cuteness and my talkative nature, I might be able to negotiate with the <cf>bigwigs at the Order and get permission!
Generally speaking, the more places that are not allowed to be shown or entered <cf>, the more treasures lie in them.
Let's definitely take a look inside [the mihashira] when we get here. <cf>Wait for me, treasure!
Um, sorry. I heard that the chief priests and priestesses are here <cf>......
errr ...
...... We are all offering prayers of condolence right now. <cf>Please don't interrupt me.
Um, how long does that prayer feel like it's going to last ......?
Oh, no, I am at a loss. How long do we have to wait? <cf>Shall we look around there first?
Hmm?　That girl is ......
Thank you for your help the other day. <cf>Are you also a member of the pilgrimage group?
By the way, is there a chief priest or priestess here?
I'm at ......, what do you want?
I was wondering if I could get permission to enter the "Pillar of Divinity" at <cf>for a little bit.
...... Is that what you need?
(surprise) ......
...... you, if you want.
This: ......
What a permit!
How in the world did you do that? <cf>No, no, wait. First of all, it's real!
Just show it to the gatekeeper and he'll tell you at .......
I'm surprised at you. ...... Who are you? <cf>And why are you doing him a favor?
...... says to do so.
I gotta go.
You're an elusive girl. ......
Anyway, we got the permit. <cf>Let's slap that gatekeeper in the face!
Hello, Uncle! <cf>Here you go.
This is a ...... permit! <cf>How in the world did you do that!
Hehehe, I'm a little acquainted with the great man.
I don't believe it ...... but the sign is real. <cf>No, but I'm not sure it's so easy to let an outsider through ......
If you doubt it, send a messenger to confirm it. <cf>We don't mind.
But if you've ever doubted a real permit, <cf>you might say that the eyes of our elected gatekeepers are knotty, huh?
If you believe your own eyes, this is unquestionably the real thing. <cf>Then ...... leave the rest to [Mihashira]'s judgment. ......
There you two, you may pass. <cf>[You have permission to enter the Mihashira.
Wow, thanks!
But [--] be careful.
What do you mean by ......?
[The Mihashira is equipped with its own defense system. <cf>It's to keep out unwanted intruders.
If you are the ones who will be welcomed by the [Mihashira] <cf>you will be able to overcome those ordeals!
But if not, then [--].
...... if it's different?
It is not my intention <cf>to retrieve the bodies of those with whom I have exchanged words. Go inside with an open mind.
Don't worry. <cf>Your skills are improving. Have confidence.
Now, let's get going!　Treasure [--] Gohon! <cf> Seek the mystery of the [raija]!
Hmmm ...... it has a great atmosphere indeed ......
Well, it's standard practice to find the treasure at the top of these things. <cf>Let's go all the way to the top!
What is that?
Apparently it's sealed. ......
Whoo!　What the hell? <cr>
I didn't touch anything!
(surprise) ah...... ah...... wow ......
(Amazing) Oh, ......
(glare and shock) ugh ...... ......
Servant!　The girl!
(Open your eyes) ......
Dear Aerinse!
(Blown away by the impact) Kyaaaah!
(Blown away by the impact) Whoa!
(withstands roar and shock) ugh ...... ugh ...... ugh ......
(Eyes meet avatar) ......!
(He looks at Aerinse.) -- Oh!
Now that's ......!
Run away!
(stands up) Tsk ......!
(Confronting the enemy) Ha!
(Blown away) Damn ......
You're not going to help us!　You're dealing with avaritia!
We cannot leave them to die!
[--]Yeah, you softy! <cr>
You managed to beat it. ...... <cf>Totally chilled my guts out.
......I don't mean to help you, but be careful, servant. <cf>They are suspicious.
It appeared different from the usual space transfers, <cf>and the atmosphere ......
We appreciate the help you have given us. <cf>However, we ask that you leave this place immediately.
I will say no more. Leave. <cf>If you do not obey, [--]
Tyris!　This man risked <cf>his life for us!
However [--].
!　This is ......
(Surprised at the surroundings) Oh ......!
(Upset by the surroundings) Oh ...... oh ......!
No way. ...... such ......?
(Notice) --!
(Impact of exterior wall broken) Ugh!
(Impact of the outer wall being broken) Gee!
(Impact of outer wall broken) Ugh! --(Impact)
The Dragon King!
Voldigen......！！
What the hell?
That's ......
King of the Dragons......?
What an intimidating feeling: ......
I feel like I'm going to be crushed just looking at it. ......
...... only this much power, huh?
...... that ate avalitaire ......?
(Tasteless Situation &amp; Warning) ......!
There you are, woman.
[--]! <cf>No, Mr. Aerinse, please run away!
But you can also visit ......!
When did you guys get back!
(Surprise) --!
[--]!　Dragon people!
You, from where!
Stop it!
Stop it!
(Running toward Voldigen, spear at the ready) <cf>Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
(Accepts the attack and is sent flying) Whoa!
(When he died) Gosh ......!
[--]!
It's not worth the feathery ...... eats.
(Weapons at the ready) ......
No, no, please run away!
It has nothing to do with you!
...... I saved him once.
...... and I helped him once.
We can't just run away here.
Huh?　You saw what I just saw, and you're still standing up to me?
Nice. Very nice indeed.
Now ......
Shall I kill this bug slowly this time?
First, the foot
Next, hand
And ...... head.
Tillis!　Tyris!
Alicia bless you!"
Are you going to jump in this condition?
(Attack on Voldigen) Ah!
You too, quickly!
(Attack) Hmph!
Kukk ......
They're moderately reckless.
Until that time eventually comes, you can at best run for cover: ......
(Chuckles) Hahahahaha!　Hahahahahaha!
Voldigen is not ......?
(Surprise.) Ahh!
(surprise)!
Somehow you managed to escape the difficulty. ...... <cf>Dear Aerinse, you made the right decision.
However, are you feeling okay? <cf>It's ...... to activate the device in that state.
...... is fine. I only went back a few hours. <cf>And the consumption of the chronograms was minimal.
Hey, who the hell are you people?
Why is Abaritia, whom I thought I had defeated, here? <cf>And why is the Dragon King after her?
What in the world is ...... happening to us right now <cf>!
I almost said this earlier, but <cf>I can't talk about us, so ......
No, now that we've gotten this involved, <cf>we can't just say we don't know about it.
There is a possibility, albeit slight, of space-time interference. <cf>Wouldn't it be too late for history to be changed?
My apologies. <cf>Once again, my name is Aerinse.
This is my squire, Tyris.
The event that just happened ...... <cf>No, the event that happened to me happened ......
[--] "Chronoleap".
Chronoleap: ......?
Yes, what you experienced is an act of <cf>time jumping!
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, so I was limited to going back a few hours to <cf>......
The art of leaping through time: ......?
I know it's hard to believe. <cf>But [--]
Let's get out of here for now. <cf>Voldigen will be here shortly.
That's right. ...... I don't want to stand around and talk. <cf>Why don't we go outside for now?
Then you will surely realize that what I am saying is <cf>true!
This time that we are in now is located in the past than <cf>just a few minutes ago. ......
[--]!　Don't, hide!
What, what?
(Surprised to see myself in the past)!
There was an eagle and ...... servant ......?
We have jumped past [--].
So that's <cf>yourselves a few hours ago!
No wonder they have defense equipment at ......[Mihashira]. <cf>It would be unbearable to have such a device used so readily.
Yeah ......?　Wait a minute. <cf> The founder who landed on the [Mihashira] ......[Raija] if that's what you mean. ......
[Raija], is it?　...... Oh, I'm sure [--]
I've heard people like us who "chrono-leap" <cf>called it in the olden days.
Well then, you [--]
It's okay ...... I'm fine, Tyris ......
Excuse me, is there a place to rest around here? <cr>
If so, there is a village near here called Larpal. <cf>You can rest there.
We'll be there. I'm sure they have more <cf>questions to ask.
Mm?　You guys came out already? <cf>Didn't we just enter the Mihashira a few minutes ago?
And what about the two guys behind ......?　Are they with you? <cf>When did they join up?
The ...... that is alive and ...... that is alive. <cf>Well, this is what it means to leap into the past: ......
?　What are you talking about? <cf>What the hell happened in there?
No. ...... Let's see... <cf>Uh, you know - what can I say. ......
...... sounds fishy.
This looks like I need to see with my own eyes what happened inside ...... <cf>
……！！
No, you can't!　It's not safe to go there now!
Dangerous ......?　Then even more so! <cf>[As the gatekeeper in charge of the Mihashira, I cannot overlook it!
<span size="Big">Wait!　You, death ......! &lt;/&gt;
<span size="Big">You must not! &lt;/&gt;
Why not?　Why can't you tell me? <cf>You could save a man's life.
By surviving that gatekeeper, <cf>I don't know what will happen in the future!
Such an exaggeration ......
What are you sneaking around for? <cf>Anyway, let me check inside!
Not now.
Not now.
Unu....... <cf>...... Do you insist on not going?
...... Okay. Let's take a moment. <cf>If you've done what you had to do, you can leave too.
Phew. Somehow you managed to stop it. <cf>Well done, my servant.
I understand how you feel. ......
Tyris: ....... <cf>You are not wrong.
But there is a line that even these people cannot cross. <cf>You understand, don't you?
Anyway, let's hurry to the village. <cf>I am worried about Master Aerinse's condition.
Are you all right?　Mr. Aerinse.
Thanks, Tyris. <cf>A little rest won't be a problem.
Sorry, but it's about time you explained it to me first.
I'd like to know who you are and what you came here <cf>to do.
We've crossed time and space ...... is <cf>somewhat familiar to you, right?
Yes, we are. We and Tyris are from <cf>1000 years in the future from now!
A thousand years in the future? <cf>That's ridiculous[--].
No, because we are now also <cf>timeless beings ......
So it's just a different range of time that we've exceeded, I guess.
Thank you for understanding so quickly.
So?　What's the purpose of coming from 1000 years <cf>into the future?
...... Avaritia Liberation, is
Avaritia is a distortion. <cf>Just being there distorts space-time.
The [distortions] created by avaritia are slowly accumulating and <cf>will swallow this planet in the not-too-distant future. ......
Such observations have been confirmed in our time at <cf>
The avaritia of our time is <cf>[distorted] and bloated and out of control!
But if you're a thousand years old, ...... in this era <cf>avaritia, you can still try your hand at it!
We will seek out and free the Avaritia and <cf>eliminate the [distortion] of space-time [--].
That is why we came from the far future. <cf>To save this planet!
The story has suddenly become more epic. ......
But can we alter the past? <cf>It's going to be something of a hassle. ......
We are giving more than enough consideration to that.
The plan is based on weighing the impact and scope of the changes caused by the release of Avaritia, <cf>and the future of the planet!
Now, I have told you everything about us. <cf>Have we convinced you?
Mm, I got the gist.
I see. Then again [--]
This story is a vital secret, and the chronoleap itself is <cf>a forbidden secret that is not allowed to anyone but a select few!
Now that you know them, <cf>you now have a choice to make!
(unavoidably agreed) ......
Help us or ...... die. <cf>Choose whichever you prefer!
Yes!
Cooperation or death. <cf>......If you choose death, I'll be serious.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. <cf>Right, servant?
...... You know I'm not joking, etc., don't you? <cf>Please, make your choice here.
...... Let's cooperate!
...... to cooperate
...... Well, I guess I'll just have to answer like this
Sorry ......
Sorry for forcing you to do this. <cf>But thank you!
Well, if you say the future of the planet is <cf>adventurous, we have to cooperate, don't we?
Oh, and [--]
Yeah, and [--]
Again, you are not to tell anyone about this. <cf>If you tell anyone [--].
Death, right? I know, I know.
Oh, yes!　If you insist, let's make a pledge. <cf>Here, sign here.
All right.
(I couldn't stop the Feste) Oh ......
(Grinning)
Yes, I wrote it. <cf>...... hmm?　A servant contract ......?
All right, I've got a new servant! <cf>I got a new servant!
Huh?　A servant!　Wait, wait [--]
I won't wait. <cf>This belongs to Feste now.
...... Dear Aerinse, I still think we should make these people <cf>disappear!
Hmmm...isn't that nice? It's actually reassuring to have someone as strong as this <cf>as a collaborator.
All right!　Now, my servant. Take care of your junior servants and <cf>make them useful to me, will you?
What?　You fell for it too?
Yeah, that's why he called me a servant earlier: ......
Well, you were a senior at Tyris! <cf>That's reassuring.
Well, well, ...... please take care of me for a while. <cf>Seniors."
Now, I have a quick favor to ask of you all.
It's okay. We don't ask you to move right away. <cf>Just rest a little and when you're ready, give us a call.
Have you had enough rest?
If you're ready, <cf>I'll tell you about my request.
Now, let's get down to business.
We have a device <cf>to look for avaritia
But it seems to have been broken in the fight we just had. ......
Are you referring to "Omnistron"? <cf>Is it perhaps difficult to repair ......?
No, it's okay. <cf>As long as we have the parts, we can make it work.
Let me ask you a few questions: <cf>Is there a place where I can get "luminous cores"?
Speaking of luminous cores, <cf>I wonder if they can be taken from the Bapharia heritage machine.
If you're looking for them around here, go to <cf>"Valley of Machines".
Now, please collect those parts.
What, we're going?
I have a duty to protect Mr. Aerinse.
Then, I will be with you [--].
No. The truth is, you're not really recovering at all, are you? <cf>You're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Anyway, Mr. Aerinse and I will stay here. <cf>I leave the parts collection to you. That's all.
Good grief, your new servant is a bit of a jerk. ......
Well, here we are, here we are! <cf>Let's get this parts gathering thing over with!
All right, servant, let's do it!
OK...I got the "luminous core" successfully! <cf>We have successfully obtained the "luminous core"!
Come on, let's get this to Tyris.
Did you get the "luminous core"?
Ah, here it is! <cf>This should replace the broken parts.
I'm going to incorporate it into Omnistron as soon as possible. <cf>Please wait a moment!
On behalf of Tyris, I would like to thank you. <cf>Thank you.
Actually, it would be better if I could give you a proper <cf>......
Then ...... is the way to go. <cf>I just want to check something.
You said ...... that those from the future are called "[raija]," but <cf>[raija] can be recognized among [raija]?
Yes, I am. When you do chronoleap, you'll have a special fluctuation in the <cf>biological engram for a while, so you'll have a special fluctuation in the biological engram.
Well, then, by the way [--].
When you first met this guy at the [Mihashira], <cf>did you feel that particular fluctuation or something like that?
No, not particularly. I thought you were a very engrammatic person ...... <cf>
It seems that you are not a visitor. <cf>Merlouf and the others are saying the right things.
Merlouf......？
The repaired Omnistron has responded!
In the area known as "Montegnor Valley" during this period, <cf>anomalous reactions of engrams can be seen!
Oh, you found avaritia early!
Not confirmed, but probably. <cf>We'll have to head to the site and investigate.
There is a village in the Montegnor Valley called Ritze <cf>, I believe. We should go there first.
Seniors are requested to go to the site first and gather information. <cf>We will leave after checking on Mr. Aerinse.
Hmm?　What's this?
This is a child of Omnistron. Please bring this with you. <cf>You will be able to communicate with this one.
I will see you later in the Ritze village. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
Then we can head to Litze. <cf>Ready?
But avaritia in Montegnor Valley? <cf>I didn't think it would appear so readily.
The Dragon King, those guys from the future, ...... <cf>what on earth is about to happen?
Hmm?　Omnistron, is it? <cf>It's responding to something.
[--]This is Tyris. Seniors, can you hear me? <cf>If you can hear me, please respond.
Oh!　I see. <cf>You said you could make a call.
Yes. Now we can share each other's location and information. <cf>Good. It seems we can communicate just fine in this day and age.
That's not all. <cf>This is how you do it: ......
&lt;Aerinse. <cf>I hope you have received it safely. &gt;
Oh my!　The letters have come to life!
Not only can you make calls, but you can also send and receive letters. <cf>This is very convenient. It is indeed a tool of the future!
If you keep in touch with us at Omnistron, <cf>we should be able to facilitate the release of Avalitia.
However, please do not use it in public without permission. <cf>Please do not use it in public. See you later.
What's the matter with you?　I am not a child. <cf>Don't act like you're showing off!
If it's about standing out, you are much more <cf>conspicuously dressed than I am!
&lt;I am sorry if I offended you. <cf>Tyris is really a very sweet girl.
&lt;Now that he is my only escort, <cf>he must be much more tense.
&lt;Different times, different places. <cf>Please forgive my unfamiliarity.
&lt;We and Tyris would be grateful for your help at <cf>. From Aerinse
Unu ....... Yeah, I can't be mad at <cf>when you apologize so honestly!
Let's go, servant!　They have no choice. <cf>Let us teach them the ways of this age.
Oh?　I guess we got to <cf>earlier than you did.
Because Master Aerinse is in too much of a hurry: ......
Because I knew that if I didn't join you as soon as possible, <cf>I would cause you trouble.
You know what? <cf>Mr. Aerinse should be a little more dignified [--].
Dear Einrain.
That girl ...... of the Bapharia cult <cf>was the "oracle priestess" ......
Do you know each other?
I've only talked to him a little. <cf>Well, I thought you were somewhat out of touch with the world.
But why is a priestess of the Order here <cf>
It is a pilgrimage. That's how we visit the holy places and pray to <cf>God.
That ...... girl like that, with only that many people?
It is said that the more rigorous the process of the Bapharia pilgrimage, <cf>the more rigorous the prayers reach the sky!
Besides, there was a recent attack by the dragon tribe, wasn't there? <cf>The atmosphere in the world is a bit rough because of that.
The anger is directed at the Order. <cf>[What is God doing, who is supposed to protect the world? [What is God doing?
People are afraid. The dragon tribe suddenly activated and <cf>avaritia beginning to show itself. ......
To appease them, he is making an untimely pilgrimage to <cf>dispel the people's distrust of him.
In fact, it is hard for the people of <cf>to complain when they see a girl like that endure so well. You know what I mean?
Are you a god protecting the world ...... or ......
Do you believe in God?
What is it all of a sudden? Are you soliciting me?
That's not the case. ......
I was wondering, if there really is a God, why does he force some <cf>to put up with him or be unreasonable?
If God can hear my wish, I wish for a world where we can all live equally <cf>
Well, it's a dream.
But dreams can be within our reach if we don't give up. <cf>That's what I believe.
Don't forget the ...... objective. <cf>Let's make exploring avaritia our top priority for now.
There is a reaction on Omnistron. <cf>Apparently, they are southwest of this village.
(Notice)!
That's it!　It is the avaritia that should be released!
All right!　That's my servant.
Well done!
We beat Avaritia, is that right?
No, not yet. Just knocking them down is not enough. ......
What's that, ......?
quietly
(Holds mouth) Ugh ......
Let us now proceed to ...... to perform the Avalitia Liberation Ceremony.
(Ritual movement like blowing on the air) Hah ...... phew ......
(Surprise!) Ah!
This is ...... what ......
Interference with space-time
The [twisted] cause and effect of avaritia was <cf>undone and released!
[twisted] twisted cause and effect: ......?
Do you know how ...... avaritia is created, or <cf>?
(Shakes head, not knowing the answer) Ugh ......
You have met your past selves.
What if at that time [--] I killed myself?
What?
Let's see... ......
Because the eagles of the past will die.
In the future, living eagles will no longer exist. ......
Because future eagles will never return to the past.
Eagles will no longer be killed by future eagles. ......
The eagles of the past will be alive and well.
Then eagles from the future will come to kill eagles and ......
Yeah, I don't know!　What's going to happen!
As you are now struggling with, there will be tremendous discrepancies
And unresolved contradictions [distort] space-time.
A being born from the [distortion] of that space-time [--].
That's what avaritia is all about.
What a ......
The only one who can correct this [distortion] is Mr. Aerinse <cf>who has a special biological engram ......
(collapses due to ritual fatigue) is ......gug......
Large ...... sturdy ......
......As I said, this ritual is very consuming!
Excuse me, we are going back to the village ahead of you.
So be it. We'll join you later.
Good work, seniors!
Well, it's a great cause to welcome you. <cf>How is Aerinse?
He is sleeping now.
The reckless chronoleap and avaritia release ceremony ...... <cf>must be taking more of a toll on your body than you can imagine!
Well ...... I hope it recovers a bit.
That ......
What's wrong?
Thank you so much <cf>for your help in liberating Avaritia!
And I apologize for my initial rudeness.
I confronted you with such a terrible choice ......, <cf>and you still helped me like this ......
Oh, don't be so awed. <cf>I'm not good at that kind of thing.
For us, it's just the right amount of boredom. <cf>Boredom rots adventurers. Right?
I feel better now. At some point, <cf>I thought I should properly apologize and thank you for your kindness.
I'm sure you'll continue to liberate <cf>avaritia in a similar fashion down the road, won't you?
That is the plan. But ...... the Dragon King is ......
Voldigen. I didn't think there was such a thing as a <cf>monster that eats avaritia. ......
...... No matter how strong the dragon tribe is, <cf>can it eat avaritia?
...... No matter how strong the dragon tribe is, <cf>can it eat avaritia?
Normally, it's impossible. <cf>But with Voldigen, it is possible.
Because [--]Voldigen himself <cf>has already become an avaritia!
What?
Voldigen is a dragon tribe that is originally <cf>sealed in this time period!
Did you know that in prehistoric times there was a conflict between the Dragon Tribe and the Bapharia God Tribe <cf>?
Yeah, ...... is close to a myth, though.
That was not a myth, but a fact. <cf>Voldigen is the Dragon King of his time.
After being turned into Avaritia, the Dragon King was sealed by the Bapharia Gods <cf>and awakened in our time ......
Seeing the dragon tribe in decline compared to the past, <cf>they started a great war for their restoration!
In doing so, he fed off other <cf>avalitiers to make himself more powerful!
Thereby, both in power and in distortion, ...... Voldigen goes beyond <cf>the bounds of normal avaritas!
Homophobia. Not horrifying at all ......
But then, trying to free Avaritia <cf>Aerinse is nothing more than a distraction to him, isn't he?
...... I guess he showed up in this day and age because he heard we were planning to liberate Avaritia <cf>
It is meaningless if they release the avaritia that is their power. <cf>That's why I'm trying to get rid of Mr. Aerinse: ......
And by the way, the distortions have not yet become bloated <cf>You can eat all you want ...... if you're an avaricious person in this era.
If left unchecked, <cf>Voldigen will grow stronger and stronger!
And this planet won't be far <cf>from being under his control.
So please ...... please <cf>protect Master Aerinse's body with us!
May we follow through on Master Aerinse's aspiration to protect <cf>all the people who live on this planet ......
Please ...... help us get to Avaritia before the Dragon King and <cf>help us achieve its liberation!
Of course, we will cooperate.
Ho-ho-ho, leave everything to this Feste-sama. <cf>It is the Lord's capacity to do what you and your servants ask of him!
Who are the servants, at all?
But thank you for ....... <cf>I've been alone and anxious all the time ...... so that's really reassuring!
Now, when Aerinse is able to move <cf>we can move on to the next Aberritya liberation as soon as possible.
Yes, I am sure it is. Next is ...... I believe, in this time period, <cf>a place called "Soundless City"!
Hmmm... ...... "Soundless City".
That place is under the jurisdiction of the Order. There should be few people going in and out. <cf>自然、お宝も……フフ……グフフフフ……！
(Duh) haha ......
After all, that amount of engrams is ....... <cf>What on earth are you thinking?
Oh well. I'll just keep doing what I do.
I'll just have to show you ....... <cf>Your 'intentions'.
Well, now that Aerinse seems to have recovered, <cf>we can head for the Soundless City, right?
Here we are! <cf>This is the Soundless City.
ククク……するぞ……お宝の匂いが……。 <cf>I can see ...... the [Golden Road] to debt repayment. ......
Our first priority is to liberate the avalitaire. <cf>Please don't forget that.
I know what I'm talking about. <cf>The treasure is just an afterthought, just an afterthought!
Now let's go to ...... again!　Treasure [--]Gohon! <cf>Aiming to liberate the second avaritia!
...... I see. <cf>That's the kind of vibe I wouldn't be surprised to find in Avaritia.
(OFF action scene) Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Is there anyone else besides us?
That's not good!　Treasure first ...... No, no, no
It would be a problem if they collide with Avaritia!
(OFF action scene) Huh... huh...
(Blown away and kneeling - fatigue) -- Ahh...! Huh... huh...
Hey, are you all right, Lord?
...... dangerous down the road.
You guys need to get out of here.
You can find out more at ......!
(See Carvein.) ......
To this person, no more fighting is ......
(I agree with Aerinse.) Hmm.
Is that avaritia ahead of us?
Yes. Biometric records matched.
It's one of the avalitias to be defeated.
I'll go. Take care of him.
I'll go. You check on him.
Aerinse and Feste, please.
Aerinse and Feste, please.
I'll take care of this place.
Please, take it easy.
(Nods and braces himself.) N...... gg!
It looks like it went well. <cf>You are indeed my first servant!　Well done!
This one didn't go so well ....... I've done some first aid, but <cf>I'm going to need to take it to the right place.
Could you please take this person to <cf>and head to the exit first?
We will stay here and <cf>liberate the avaritia
Well, that's probably for the best. <cf>But will you two be all right?
I am Master Aerinse's bodyguard. <cf>I will protect you even at the cost of my life.
Besides, the main enemies were defeated by my seniors.
All right. Then, we'll take him and go on. <cf>There is a garrison of the Order on the way. That should be fine.
Well then, please take care of them. <cf>We will be right after you.
Hmm?
Servant, <cf>didn't you just hear the omnistron ring?
Oh?　You have a message from Tyris.
&lt;Tyris. <cf>Thank you for defeating Avaritia.
&lt;Avaritia that is defeated will <cf>disappear after a few minutes to a few hours &gt;.
&lt;If you don't release them in the meantime, you will have to wait for them to be restored. <cf>How long will that take ......&gt;
＜As soon as the liberation ceremony is over, <cf>we will head to the garrison immediately.
＜How is the injured young man doing? <cf>It is not a serious wound, so I think he will be fine.
＜I'll see you later.
He's more disciplined than you'd think.
Well, let's hurry to the garrison.
Oh, I noticed. How are you feeling?　Big brother.
Is this ......?
It's the garrison of the Order. <cf>Don't worry, we've defeated that avaritia☆.
Avaritia: ......
Avaritia!　I knew that was Avaritia!
(Carvein's momentum pressuring him) Ugh ......
Oh, oh. Yes. <cf>You were fighting without knowing it, weren't you?
Avaritia on the cult's holy ground ...... <cf>Is he right? ......
......What in the world is a Knight Commander ......
Knight Commander?
Oh, no, ....... <cf>Uh, you guys helped me out?
Yeah!　 <cf>It was easier than [twisting] the hand of a baby!
That avaritia like a baby ......?
How amazing!　Please let me call you Master! <cf>No, I want to call you Master!
Don't you ever think about the possibility that I might have beaten you? ......
No way!　Such a dainty, cute, <cf>little girl, the object of our protection, fought with us!
......!　Ho, ho, ho! <cf>You are quite a sight to behold. I like it!　What's your name?
Oh, no!　This is rude. I should have said my name first. <cf>My name is Carvein.
I am Feste. This is my servant. <cf>By the way, why are you there?
It's ...... its, I'm doing a little research. <cf>A friend asked me to ......
...... but on the way there <cf>I got caught off guard by that avaritia and ......
Yes!　I have to thank my master. <cf>He saved me, but if I don't do this, I'll lose my gratitude!
...... Hmm?　Huh? <cf>My wallet, is it missing?　You must have dropped it in that fight!
Okay, let's go pick it up. Let's go now. <cf>And give me all the money.
But ...... going to pick it up now would be an unnecessary inconvenience to <cf>the master, wouldn't it?
Besides, I should be repaying the favor with my own body. <cf>But I also have a favor to ask of York: ......
...... I see. There was that one!
Please accept this!
Is this a ...... Imagine Seed?
Master ...... Oh, no, it's not a master. <cf>It was given to me by another master.
It's an imperfect Imagine Seed, and I've never been able to use it, but ...... <cf>it's strangely calming to have it.
To others it's a piece of junk, but to me it's my most prized possession. <cf>So I hope you'll at least let me have this.
Of course, I will thank you appropriately later. <cf>But for now, that's all I can do [--].
......, hey, servant?
What's the matter?　You just daze off?
(Is that my memory now?　Or is it ......)
(Is that my memory now?　Or is it ......)
Carvein?　He's already gone. <cf>It's good to see a young man recover so quickly.
I don't like being given an Imagine Seed that I can't use. ...... <cf>Well, it may come in handy. Keep it.
He was quite a noisy fellow, wasn't he? But he had a good eye to see that I was <cf>pretty and cute.
Carvein, huh? ...... <cf>Next time I see you, I'll make you pay for it. ......
Oh, did the avaritia release go well?
Yes, thanks to you, there has been no delay. <cf>By the way, who is she?
He just left. <cf>I guess it wasn't that big of a deal.
I see. Good. ......
Well, what's next?
From here to the northeast ...... in this time period would be the desert ......? <cf>There is an avaritia response that should be released there.
Desert ...... Oh, you mean the "Salamzart" one. I believe there is a <cf>barrier on the way. Let's go through there.
Well, gentlemen, are you ready?　 <cf>Let's head for the gate.
Would you like to pass through the barrier?
If [--], you will need a guarantor.
Huh?　A guarantor? <cf>We've never had such a system before, have we?
It started a while ago. <cf>...... See, you've had a lot going on with "Bernhardt".
So, the Commander of the Duchy Knights, <cf>Dunkirk, who is acting on behalf of the recuperating King, came to Salamzart to say hello.
That's why Salamzart has asked us to tighten <cf>the general immigration checks.
I see. ....... <cf>Time to get politically minded, I see.
And what about a guarantor? <cf>What kind of person should I ask?
Yes. Basically, those who have <cf>permission from Salamzart's side or [--].
A resident of Asterleeds for more than 10 years, <cf>
What a pain in the ass!
It's a hassle for us to check every single thing. <cf>But it's a rule, so what can we do?
Anyway, please have your guarantor certificate ready. <cf>That's a condition for getting through customs.
So, do you have a ...... guarantor for your application?
Well, it's the husband of the coin-operated pavilion at a time like this, isn't it?
I believe he's had his store there for over 10 years <cf>
Are you acquainted with the person?
Yes, I and my servants too. <cf>I will owe my husband another debt, but it can't be helped.
If you two trust each other, <cf>we can trust you too!
Mm-hmm. <cf>Well then, let's set off for Asterleeds!
<span size="Big">Guarantor! &lt;/&gt;
That's out of the blue!　You're borrowing money from a bad credit institution? <cf>I don't want a co-signer!
No, it's not!　It's the I.D. The guarantor! <cf>You need it to get through the customs!
Oh?　Oh, ...... that. They say Dunkirk is coming. <cf>What's with you guys, are you going to Salamzart?
Well, I have some business to attend to. <cf>But I was told I need a guarantor.
Well, I don't mind, but ......
You've got two very pretty babes with you. <cf>I hope you didn't do anything wrong. ......?
I'm not doing anything wrong! <cf>Rather, I'm helping people!
[--] I know you say that, but really?
Yes, yes! <cf>Feste and the others have been very helpful.
We are happy to welcome Tyris here as a new servant of Feste's <cf>and ......
New servant: ......
Yes, I have senior servants, and <cf>I receive daily guidance and encouragement from them!
Senior servants: ......
Let me give the guarantor some thought.
We didn't really do anything wrong!
Haha, just kidding. <cf>I know you guys ain't that kind of guys.
...... has one condition for being a guarantor
Oh, yeah? If it's not about the money, I'm all ears.
I need you to help me fix this guy.
Hmm?　Imagine Seed?
Yeah, I broke it in my carelessness. <cf>I'm in a lot of trouble if I can't use this thing.
Hmmm... ....... What kind of Imagine Seed is this?
It's to keep in touch with my brother.
Huh?　You have a brother!
Oh, yeah. I'm taking over my family's house instead of my prodigal son. <cf>What, you think it's funny that I have a family?
No, well, ....... Oh yeah, family. ......
If that's the case, I'll take care of it. <cf>So, what's needed to fix it?
It's the sap of the spiny dogwood. <cf>You'll need a good amount of that.
You can look for it on the Ritze Tradeway. <cf>You should be able to pick a lot in that area.
I'm asking you. If Imagine Seed can fix it, <cf>I'll be your guarantor or co-signer!
Let us handle this one. <cf>You guys get some rest.
No, then we will survey the surrounding area.
Well, be careful.
Oh, you brought what I asked for. <cf>That's a big help. Thanks a lot!
Leave the rest to the experts. <cf>As long as you have the right materials, you should be fine, right?
Oh. Then I'll be your guarantor as promised. <cf>Just give me a minute.
You got what you needed.
Mm-hmm. All is well. <cf>Did anything change on your side?
Yes, there was no problem. Thanks to our seniors.
See, here's the deed. <cf>It's properly watermarked with Asterleeds.
Oh!　That's what I'm talking about! <cf>What you have is what you have, my friend!
I hope ...... you can communicate with your <cf>brother with that Imagine Seed!
Yeah, I know. <cf>Well, all he does is complain.
Take care of your family. <cf>If you are left alone, you won't be able to listen to their complaints.
Well, the guarantor problem is now solved. <cf>Now, let's get back to the barrier!
Would you like to pass through the barrier? <cf>Then let me see your guarantor's certificate.
Hmmm... ...... you are doing it right. <cf>Very well, please come on through.
Okay, now we can get through the barrier with a big smile on our faces. <cf>The desert is right in front of us!
It's been a while since I've had this dry wind ......
Feste, I see that you have traveled in the desert <cf>
That's reassuring.
Well, well, don't worry. <cf>Leave this to my experienced hands!
(Panting)
What's wrong!　What's going on!
Monsters appeared ahead of us! <cf>Are you adventurers?　Then help us!
We still have one girl left! <cf>She took the bait herself and let us go. ......
Please!　Please, please, let her [--]
(Amazing) u...... u......
(Guns firing) Hmmm ......
What's with that priestess!　She's so strong!
You're adventurers!　Give me a hand [--]
Gohonk! <cf>You're adventurers, aren't you?　Give us a hand!
*For audio division* <cf>You adventurers, right?　Give us a hand!
Oh, oh?
You guys go ahead and <cf>rescue the child who was used as bait.
I'm going to beat the crap out of them around here!
I don't know, but I guess I'll follow that priestess for now. <cf>I'll go with you, servant!
[――]！？
There!　Servant!
(Running away from enemies) hah...... hah......
You're so persistent!　That's enough!
Stay back!
Here it comes: ......!
Thanks. That was helpful. ......
I heard you took the bait yourself. <cf>You are a fool for taking the bait. ......
I'm not reckless. I have confidence in my legs. <cf>I've been trained on stage.
Stage?
(Smiles) Phew!
My name is Charlotte. I'm a member of a troupe of traveling performers.
Well!　A traveling entertainer! <cf>I've never seen you before!
Really? <cf>Well, then, you'll definitely have to see our troupe!
I'm going to be performing at Salamzart down the road. <cf>You are welcome to come and see it. My singing has a good reputation.
Yes, definitely!　I'm looking forward to it.
Why not ......? <cf>I've never seen a performance before. ......
I don't have a choice now.
Thank you, Tyris. I love it!
You must be very boxed in. <cf>So, are you guys escorts?
Well, that's about it. <cf>By the way, are you alone?　Who are your troupe mates?
You should have gotten to Salamzart first. <cf>I was just going to pick up a few things I forgot. ......
Hey!　Charlou!　Charlotte-oo!
Oh, just in time. <cf>Looks like my buddies are here to pick me up.
Okay, I'll be there. You should definitely come see the show!
A performance by a traveling troupe of entertainers? I wonder how good her singing is. <cf>Maybe I can go listen to it?
Yes, by all means, let's go!
I will be at <span size="Big">ready to go&lt;/&gt;!
Well then. Now that we've finished our work, let's get going.
It's dangerous to wander around the desert for nothing. <cf>Let's go to the base town first.
Here is an oasis in the desert, <cf>Salamzart!
What do you think? <cf>Don't you think there's something unique about it?
That's no wonder, this is a city of peddlers, nomads, drifters, and <cf>a motley assortment of others.
Rest assured, we have everything you need for your daily life. <cf>It's a perfect base for adventure!
Mhmm, I see [Kousai-fu] is out. ......
It's a common phenomenon in desert areas. When it appears, <cf>it temporarily disrupts the flow of engrams.
I see, this is ......
Don't tell me you can't use Omnistron?
I knew it was a phenomenon that happens on earth in these times, but I never thought I'd actually encounter it <cf>
I'm stumped. This doesn't help us locate <cf>in Avaritia.
Relax. <cf>Give it a minute, and it'll all be over.
However, we can't just sit back and wait <cf>. We can't let the Dragon King get ahead of us. ......
Is there a Bapharia temple here?
Hmm?　Yeah, most big towns have one.
Then go to the temple. <cf>You might get some tips on avaritia.
What?　Why is there information about Avaritia in the Temple?
Anyway, please believe in me now. <cf>Please.
This is Salamzart's temple. <cf>Now, anyone who might know anything about avaritia, please visit ......
Hey!　Is anyone there?
Oh?　You guys are at ......
Oh, you are the strong priestess of yore!
My name is Electra. <cf>Thank you for your help on that occasion.
What happened to the girl who took the bait?
Don't worry. I'm sure they'll be here before us. <cf>We'll be able to take on even the most ferocious enemies with a single blow!
Well, how wonderful!
Thanks to you, a young girl's life was saved. <cf>The God of Bapharia must be very pleased.
Sometimes, I would like to ask you one question: ...... <cf>Have you seen a girl in a miko outfit different from mine?
I'm part of a pilgrim group and was supposed to meet up with them here <cf>I couldn't find them no matter how I looked ......
Pilgrimage group ......?　The Girl in the Miko Dress ......?
...... No way, Einlein?
You know the oracle priestess!
<span size="Big">Sssshhhh! &lt;/&gt; Saved me the trouble of explaining!
Cohon!　...... Yes, it is Mr. Einrain. <cf>I am his escort.
I came to replace my predecessor, but <cf>that crucial priestess was not there. ......
......He's always wandering off in a daze. <cf>No matter how many bodies I have, it's never enough!
Hey, you're leaking your true feelings.
Oh my goodness, ugh. Well, that's why I was wondering if you know Mr. Einrain at <cf>if you could lend a hand?
Mu...... what do you do, servant?
Let's take on ....... A priestess of the oracle would have more information at <cf>avaritia
I will tell you why later. Anyway, now that Omnistron is <cf>unavailable, I'm willing to bet on any possibility!
Oh, God!　Mercifully bless these people!
Master Einrain should be in this town. <cf>Please let me know if you find her.
Sis, I'd like to continue our conversation.
What happens when there are beasts?
Oh, ...... yeah, yeah, continue. <cf>That "beast" has destroyed all the old civilization.
But the beast is not bad. It's the humans that are bad. <cf>Because we have treated ourselves as the best. ......
Such a tragedy must never happen again. That is why <cf>we must worship the God of Bapharia and be modest[--].
It's kind of boring.
Do you have any more <cf>interesting stories that would make me go baaaack?
Bwah, bwah ......?
The Beast That Destroyed the Old World. <cf>Surely, this story must be a bit boring for children.
But ...... other stories, it's only about doctrine ......
What, you don't have to talk about it, there are other ways. <cf>To soothe your child, go to .......
(singing a cappella)
...... and, well, not like this.
What was that song?　Beautiful!　Tell me!
Oh, me too!
Ho-ho-ho, you like it. All right, all right.
That ...... I, too, would like to know that ......!
Oh, you've also attracted the attention of the oracle priestess. <cf>But actually, I don't know much about the details either. ......
No, no [--] there he is!　Mr. Einrain!
(Frightened) Wow!
Please do not wander out alone. <cf>I have told you many times that it is dangerous.
Here we go. If you don't get rid of your [wanderlust] any more, I'll have Lugerio scold you at <cf>!
Wait!　That ...... you are avaritia ......
Please go ahead. <cf>I have to talk to these people: ......
Huh?　But [--]
I will return properly. <cf>...... what you don't want Lugerio to scold you for.
Well, these people can ......
Excuse me, can I speak to Mr. Einrain, please?
You want to ask me about ...... avaritia?
Please let me know <cf>where I might find Avaritia in this vicinity. I know you are in trouble too.
....... <cf>Maybe you are more likely to be in "[Insect Fortress] in [Insect Fortress]" ......
How did you know that?
I have to get back soon. <cf>Lugerio is pissed at me. ......
...... having secrets from fellow travelers is not a very favorable trend <cf>
I'm sorry. One day I will tell you all about it.
When you are done liberating avatars, all of them are available at ......
It's a creepy place, ....... <cf>Let's get this over with.
You can afford such a guy now!
You did it!　That's the third one!
Seniors!　Behind you!
(Notice) Oh, ......
(surprise) Oh ...... oh!
[Avoid.
(Responding to a call) Ah!
(Sticks spear in) Mn!
(Jumps while pulling out a stinging spear) <cf>Eaaaahhh!
(Landing)!
What a ...... blow or ......!
You're a great shot, but ...... you're still a bit stuffy.
Dear Dunkirk!
Sorry, Veronica. I beat you to it.
No, we are more ashamed of ourselves for falling behind.
Dunkirk......? <cf>Dunkirk, Knight Commander of the Duchy of Bernhardt?
...... these men?
He was the first visitor. He was fighting Aberritya earlier. <cf>Maybe he's stronger than you?
I know the Commander is not crazy in his eyes, but I'm not going to lose to some <cf>who-knows-what horse-bone!
Totally, you're not a jokester. <cf>Well, that's what I'm buying into.
Haha ...... sorry!
I have seen you fight. <cf>I see you are an adventurer of some renown.
It would be too dangerous for ...... to bring the <cf>weak to a place like this, no matter how skilled they may be!
Avaritia is like a mass of engrams. <cf>Even though it's a corpse, what impact can it have if it's nearby: ......
Go quickly to a safe place. Apparently there is no treasure here <cf>such as you seek, my lords.
...... It appears to be a very old site. <cf>I don't see the need for further investigation.
We're leaving now. What about you? <cf>We will escort you to the exit if necessary.
No, it's okay. <cf>I'll just be grateful for your kindness.
The pride of an adventurer, huh? <cf>Well then, we shall take our leave.
I wish you all the best of luck on your journey.
Ha~~ ...... I'm surprised. I never thought I'd run into the head of the Order of the Duchy of Bernhardt at a place like this <cf>
Well, ...... it's about time Aerinse and the others came out of the <cf>liberation ceremony.
Thank you for your patience at ....... <cf>We were able to complete the ceremony without a hitch!
Fuu ....... <cf>This is finally my third one.
By the way, is the person you just mentioned famous?
Knight Commander Dunkirk. A man of valor and civility, <cf>a model of what a knight should be.
I had heard that he had recently replaced the ailing Lord King, <cf>and was now serving as regent with a high civilian official. ......
Why did we come to this place?
You said something about a survey of the ...... site.
Okay, I'm curious: ......
Okay, we're going back to Salamzart as soon as possible. <cf>We need to let Aerinse rest.
Sorry ......
In addition, I will report this to Einlein. <cf>He is an informant of Avaritia.
......Are you still unable to use Omnistron's ......? <cf> The [kousai-fu] is still affecting ......
............? <cf>...... flicks ...... responds ...... to ......... ...
--!　The communication is ......!
Hey, Tyris! <cf>What are you doing out there?
Ah!　Let's see... ......
...... no good?
Hey, Tillis-?
Sorry!　I'm coming!
...... Hmph, you've liberated the third one too. <cf>It's time to ...... ......
Is that ...... avalitaire ......?
It was absolutely nothing to be afraid of!
So ...... good ......
Master Einrain seems to have a lot on his mind about you guys <cf>
Well, I guess. I'm sure it's all a result of <cf>my virtue?
...... But seriously, <cf>why are you being so nice to us?
What is it?　It's making a racket.
Oh, it must be because the traveling troupe of performers is about to begin their performance.
<span size="Big">Performances! &lt;/&gt;
Tyris, Tyris!　He said the troupe is performing!
I understand how you feel, but can we do this a little later? <cf>You need to rest now.
But I also made a promise to that girl: ......
I wish I could go see it too.
I wish I could go see it.
...... already, seniors are so sweet.
All right, let's go. <cf>However, if you get tired, you must tell me immediately. Is that clear?
It's hard work there too. ...... Here's another one, Einrain-sama has been pestering me to go to <cf>to see the performance.
Because ...... reputable divas will be ......
Hoh. That Charlotte, <cf>, is quite the rumor mill, isn't she?
I'd like to hear this one even more. <cf>All right, let's go to the plaza, servant!　We'll get you a front row seat!
Oh, well, look who's here! <cf>Soon, the Zilwet Traveling Troupe's proud diva will be here!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Next, we have a diva who is rapidly gaining popularity in our troupe. <cf>Next is Miss Charlotte!
Hey everyone~!　Hello~!
(Waving and cheering for Charlotte) <cf>Wow!
(Waving his hands in support of Charlotte) <cf>hoo~ hoo~ hoo~ hoo~ hoo~ hoo~!
(Waving his hands in support of Charlotte) <cf>Phew!
(Supporting Charlotte) <cf>Phew!
Charlotte, the diva of us all! <cr>
I will make you my prisoner!
(waves his hand to the audience and laughs)
Kyaaaah!
That's her.
(Noticing) Ha!
Run!　The target is you!
(Seeing the assailant on the stage - running away)
Take him alive.
Save that girl!
You have to help me!　Please!
Dear Einrain, what's with that girl? <cf>Are you sure it's an oracle?
No, it's not. Not this time. <cf>I don't know. ......
Please, please help that child. ......
Hurry up!　They've gone out of town!
(Action scene) deyaaah ...... yaaaah ...... <cf>ugh ...... hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Oh ...... oh ...... oh!
(Action scene) Ugh..!
(Action scene) <cf>Oh Oh Oh Oh ...... Oh Oh Oh!
(Action scene) <cf>ugh ...... hoh ...... hoh oh ...... ah ...... ah!
(Action scene) Ugh ...... oh!
Master!
Master!　I'll take care of that one!
That's what a master is. A brilliant fight!
But I never thought I'd see Master <cf>here.
(Looking at the fallen armed group) ......
Why are you being targeted?
I'd rather hear it from me!　Why ......
Seniors!
You were in Soundless City: ......
...... Oh, that time! <cf>I think you patched me up, didn't you?
Tyris. Glad to see you are well.
The city is fine. The chaos has subsided.
We also carried a member of the troupe who had collapsed on the way to town. <cf>That level of injury would have been no problem.
(Relief) ......
Good: ......
We should go to Salamzart too. <cf>There might still be some of these guys around here.
Ah!　That's mine! <cf>When did you drop it!
......I'm going to ask you something I can't get my hands on, where did you get this?
Huh?　Oh ...... this is ...... <cf>a lead on the guys who took your mother.
Taken away from ......?
......When I was little, my mom was kidnapped by a strange group of people. <cf>That's when they dropped this.
I've been holding onto it for a while, hoping it might give me some clues. <cf>I ended up not knowing anything about the meaning of the inscribed crest. ......
I am sorry for asking ......[brusque] question!
No, thanks for picking it up. You saved my life.
Let's go, Master. <cf>If we dawdle, we're going to have other enemies.
Why was that in this day and age ......?
Char!　You're safe!
These people helped me. <cf>By the way, is everyone okay?
Yeah, ...... no one's been seriously injured, but that's about it. <cf>But they're all strong, so they'll get better soon!
...... those people were after me.
...... because of me ......
Don't take it on yourself. The troupe is a family. <cf>It's natural to protect them!
Now, get some rest. <cf>You must be tired from all the things you've been through.
I'm going back to the others. <cf>I'll be sure to thank you later!
You should rest too, Master. Fatigue is the enemy of travel.
Well, I've got to go join my friend. <cf>If you'll excuse me then, Master!
Carvein is right, we should take a break. <cf>There is a "rest area," as I recall. Let's go there.
Mm, I'm sure you'll get plenty of rest here: ......
I'm so sleepy. ...... I'm at my limit too......
You should sleep too. <cf>Sleep when you can, that's the secret of traveling. ......
Suyaa ......
Mother!　Mother!
I'm going after ......
(sigh - notice) ......
This little thank-you won't be enough.
WOW! <cf>Awww ......
Where do you think you're going? <cf>Their friends might still be out there.
Because it's ....... <cf>If I were here, I'd be all over you guys.
So until we know for sure what those guys are, <cf>I'm going to go hide somewhere.
Where is where? <cf>And how do you know who these guys are?
I know a great place for you to hide.
Carvein! <cf>Hmm?　What are you doing with Einrain?
Friends ......
I originally came here to meet Einlein and <cf>another friend.
But I had to change my plans a bit. ......
I need to lay low for a bit, too. <cf>Why don't you come with me anyway?
Huh?　...... yeah!
She won't let me help you.
Why ......
I don't know either. <cf>But ...... because I care about you ......
Einlein offered us a hiding place. <cf>There, you can calm down and think things over.
I understand your confusion, but I think you can trust me. <cf>After all, Einlein is a priestess of the oracle.
Sh, the oracle priestess!　This girl!
And ...... Carvein is a knight of the duchy.
Oh, my God!　Did you hear that, servant!
Sorry for my silence, Master. <cf>I have a bit of a reason: ......
As she says, I belong to the Order of Bernhardt. <cf>I'm on vacation right now. ......
What do you think?　Are you willing to go with me?
Hey, I don't know what it is, but ...... <cf>Anyway, thank you for your time now!
Yes, I understand.
Rest assured, Einlein, my master. <cf>I will protect her in the name of my knighthood.
Contact York, are you sure you can handle this alone?
Get help: ......
Oh, I see. That's a relief to me too.
Well then, Master. I'll see you somewhere else!
Thanks again and again for your help. <cf>I'll pay you back someday!
Dunkirk, the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Bernhardt ...... <cf>And Carvein, a Knight Commander but for a reason ......
Something smells fishy: ......
I have a favor to ask. <cf>Come to the ...... plaza later.
Did you come to ask me for a favor?
I'm sorry to call you out here ....... <cf>I didn't want others to ...... hear about it. ......
Well?　There seems to be a reason for this. ......
Don't tell Electra and the others, but I need to see my friends. <cf>...... very, very important promise
So ...... take me to the [Fountain] of the [Hermit] in [Olvid Plains], <cf>take me there!
What do you do with ......?
I took care of it.
Thanks ......!
What, we needed to give Aerinse a break too, and <cf>is a good way to pass the time in the meantime.
Sometimes the reward is [--].
Hey, what's with the eyes? ...... <cf>Oh God, I get it, I get it!
Well, this girl has helped me a lot. <cf>I will accept a fair price.
Well then, my servants. <cf>As soon as we are ready, we will go to the Fountain of the Hermits.
Where are your friends? <cf>I don't see anyone. ......
This ...... was down ......
Hmm?　Is that a ...... handkerchief? <cf>It is folded very tightly.
I mean, it's so freakin' beautiful <cf>it's a scary level ......
This nervous crease is a result of York's ......
If it belongs to the person waiting?
I was supposed to meet you here. <cf>What in the world is ......
Look at this.
Look at this.
Hmm?　It's a faint footprint, but it's a human footprint. <cf>They are very disorganized.
And ...... this is a dead insect ......?
<span size="Big">Oh, my God!　Oh my God! &lt;/&gt;
What, what, what's wrong!
York, I don't like bugs!　They are my natural enemy! <cf>I turn blue just at the sight of even a small one!
If you were attacked by a big one here [--]!
Oh, calm down!　First of all, you calm down!
In the meantime, follow the footprints before the wind blows them away. <cf>There is a good chance that York and the others are there. Is that clear?
York ...... stay safe ......
Judging from the footprints, it seems they fled to the southwest. <cf>We must hurry, my servant!
Your footprints are disappearing around here. <cf>Don't tell me they're already in the belly of the worm. ......
What's up!
...... Mmm, bugs!
...... Okay, we'll take care of it!
You showed up at ......!
Avenge York and the others! <cf>Servant, do it!
Fu ...... <cf>can at least mourn.
Einrain！
York！？
Oh, oh?　What? <cf>You're alive!
Thank goodness you're okay. ......
Yeah, well, somehow. <cf>I'm sorry I made you worry.
I got attacked by a bug and ran away from it uncontrollably and ...... <cf>hid there for a long time.
Then get the hell out of here.
I thought I passed out again: ......
Ha ha ...... I can't collapse before I meet you <cf>so I'll be there in spirit.
It's a two-person world.
You didn't have to do that. ......
I'm pushing you too hard to begin with. <cf>If that's the case, I have to work hard too.
Yes, I know. I think we did our best this time.
Haha ...... Einlein praised me.
Hey!　Don't forget us!　You should totally check out ....... <cf>If you're so bad with bugs, maybe you should think about where you're going to meet us.
Sorry, I'm sorry. I couldn't stand out, so I went to ....... <cf>I just couldn't help but be limited in my space.
How ......?
Oh well. If we stay here, we might get attacked by bugs again. <cf>If you're okay, let's head for the tent.
Sorry to call you out here.
By the way, who are these people?
I asked for an escort up here. <cf>These people are fine.
Hehe ......
It's very unusual for her to turn to someone else for help.
Sorry for the delay in greeting you. My name is York. <cf>I am Einlein's childhood friend.
Speaking of which, where's Carvein? <cr>
He's on the run with his little diva.
What?
There was a traveling entertainer girl who was being targeted by strange people. <cf>He went to a safe house to protect the girl. ......
Hey, what the hell, that's how it works.
I didn't think that Carvein, who is all about the martial arts, had a girlfriend! <cf>I was so excited. ......
You seem to be very shy yourself, don't you?
No, no, that's not what I meant when I called Einlein <cf>
What do you mean by that?
You don't have to pursue it!　Uh, you, <cf>, must have something for me from Carvein?
You can find this at ......
I see ....... Father is ......
Let me ask you in return for your reward. <cf>What are you doing?
A priestess of the oracle who works in secret with her congregation. <cf>A member of the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt for a reason.
And the two of them must meet in hiding. <cf>Oh my ......
Oh, by the way, I met the Knight Commander Dunkirk at "Insect Fortress" <cf>in [Insect Fortress].
Was it Dunkirk's fault that Carvein had to 'change his plans and go into hiding' <cf>?
I'm having you two look into something I'm a little concerned about <cf>
But it's just a personal thing. <cf>I've had Carvein take a break from the Order. ......
He wondered if his father's thunder would strike him if he found out.
Father?
Knight Commander Dunkirk is my father.
(Surprise!) What?
So please don't tell the Knights about this. <cf>I don't want my father to be angry with me either.
My father is especially strict with me and Carvein. <cf> He said, "["]Both of you should be a fine cornerstone of the principality! ["]"] and so on.
I'm glad you're setting expectations for me.
Well, I think I know most of what I need to know. <cf>Thanks for coming, Einrain.
York...... are you okay?
Excuse me, could you please send her to Salamzart at <cf>?
Oh, oh. <cf>I thought your request included that much.
Thank you very much. Best regards.
See you later, Einrain. Good luck on your pilgrimage!
N......
That young man, York, ......, is quite a player.
You were telling the truth when you told us. <cf>And you don't want Dunkirk to know.
but ...... never mentioned a word about the important things
Telling a few truths to smoke out what you really want to hide <cf>is a technique I often use too ......
Ah!　Mr. Einrain!
You disappeared on your own again!　Do you know how much we <cf>worried about you ......!
<span size="Big">The face of God in Bapharia is also three times! &lt;/&gt;
I'll have Master Lugerio scold you this time!
Uu......
Speaking of which, why are you and Mr. Einrain together?
Lost!
I went for a little walk and got lost and ....... <cf>And these people helped me out with that.
Yes, yes. <cf>I went outside and saw a familiar figure wandering around~?
Walking...... lost......
Huh. ....... <cf>Well, I'll just leave it at that: ......
Come on, let's go back. <cf>The congregation is all waiting for you, Master Einrain.
Thanks ....... <cf>If you need any help, come to me.
Well, that's all for now. <cf>It is time for us to join up with Aerinse and the others.
They should be at the rest stop.
Thank you for your hard work. While we have been resting, <cf>a lot has happened, hasn't it?
We would love to hear from you!
I see that ...... Mr. Einrain and his team are working without telling <cf>either the Order or the Knights.
Actually, ...... we'd like to talk to you too!
...... and about an old man.
An old man, you say?
That person may have been a ...... <cf>chronoleptic!
I haven't been able to get confirmation, but <cf>I think it's quite possible
And where is the old man?
It is a bar. Its ...... like a poor body, living off the <cf>leftovers from the tavern and ......
Hmmm ......
Chronoleaping is a forbidden art. <cf>As for us, we can't leave it alone.
Mm. ....... <cf>Servants, let's go talk to them just to be sure.
Alicia bless you ...... Alicia bless you ......
'Alicia bless you' ......? <cf>This word, somewhere ......
...... Chronogate activation words.
Oh, yes!　As I recall, you said!
Yes, I am sure that the person who is doing the chronoleaping is the only one who knows about it. <cf>Only those who perform chronoleaps should know.
Then this old man is ......
I asked around and it seems that <cf>drifted here a few years ago and no one knows the past ...... and
Moreover, that ...... he is not very conscious or <cf>able to hold a conversation!
No......
I don't want to disturb you by talking to you unprovoked, <cf>but I'm not sure if I should leave it like this.
Tyris and I have been worrying about it for a long time.
It's a tough call, but ...... <cf>it's easier said than done.
Hey, Grandpa! <cf>Would you like to have a little chat with me?
You are suddenly charging in without hesitation. <cf>Are you sure about that, Mr. Aerinse?
I'm sure it will be fine, Tyris. <cf>Let's leave it to Mr. Feste here.
Hey, hey, hey, grandpa!
Blessings on ...... Alicia. <cf>Alicia ...... of ......?
[--]!　You are!
Huh?　Me, sir?
Oh, no way, no such ....... <cf>No, no. But ...... oh ......!
Um, what about me?
...... O God of Bapharia. <cf>Thank you for this meeting that came to me in my last hours.
Gentlemen, we have some questions for you at <cf>
Why did you say that word [--]?
From the looks of it, you are adventurers. <cf>Then would you be willing to Accept my request?
If you successfully fulfill this old man's wish, <cf>I'll answer anything!
I thought we could have a normal conversation, but it turns out to be a business deal. <cf>So, what do you want?
...... "The Flower of the Sand Wind". <cf>Please help me with that flower that he loved so much.
Seniors, may I accept this request? <cf>I can't bring myself to leave this elderly person alone. ......
Yeah, I'll Accept.
Yeah, I'll Accept.
But, "Sandwind Flowers"... ....... <cf>What kind of product is that?
I have seen it in an illustrated book. <cf>As I recall, it was a beautiful flower made of sand crystals. ......
It is said to be an accidental product of the wind blowing on the sand.
Go find that coincidence, he said. <cf>Isn't this moderately challenging?
Yes, I agree. <cf>There's just too little information out there. ......
[--]Yes!　Einlein can't <cf>do something about it using the Order's intelligence network?
[If you have any trouble, come to me at <cf>and I'll help you out right away!
I agree with Feste. <cf>The Order is looking around the area, so it's possible.
Okay, let's go see Einrain as soon as possible!
Oh! <cf>I've got a problem, and I'm here as soon as I can!
...... what?
Have you ever heard of the "Flower of the Sand Wind"? <cf>It's a flower made of sand crystals. ......
...... Electra, Electra!
What's going on all of a sudden? <cf>We are not suspicious!
You wanted to see me, Master Einrain?
[--], it's you guys again ...... Gohon! <cf>Is it you guys?
I would like information on "The Flower of the Sand and Wind".
Huh?　What is it, out of the blue?
These people have helped me and I need to give back to them ...... <cf>
Is that what you mean by "sand wind flower"? <cf>Not at all. You're always short of words.
Well, okay. <cf>I'm just in the process of gathering topographical information on the surrounding area.
How about ...... what's going on?
Oh, ugh. Don't worry about it. <cf>Anyway, it's "Flower of the Wind of Sand".
Please wait a moment. <cf>I'll ask the local congregation.
I'm not sure if it's still there, but <cf>I could tell you where I saw it a few years ago!
Do you have a map?　Let's see, ...... it's around here.
Thank you. You are indeed a cult.
Ummm...this is a lot easier than <cf>catching Master Einrain...
How long have you been out of sight ......
...... Uh, is this okay?
Yes, I am. Thank you for your time.
Oh, you're going too?　Please be careful. <cf>Don't do anything unnecessary and don't get hurt.
Aerinse seems to be unfamiliar with fighting. <cf>Please protect her well, Tyris.
......?　Yes, that of course.
Well, I'll leave you with this.
Well, now that we have the information. <cf>Let's go to the location on this map!
Let's see, back here, huh? <cf>We're gonna have to do a thorough search.
Looks like we're going to have to take that thing down!
Well, it's blooming! <cf>This is the "Flower of the Wind of Sand," isn't it?
Yes, I am interested in this product. As you can see in the illustrated book: ...... No, it's more than that!
A miracle of nature's creation. <cf>The fragile crystals of sand that break down within a few days. ......
How beautiful it is. ...... <cf>Such a beautiful thing to see in this world.
There are so many miracles in this land that we don't know about <cf>
Yes, Mr. Aerinse. If I hadn't gone outside ...... <cf>I wouldn't have known about it if I hadn't come here in the past!
Yes, really ......
I share this excitement because of you. <cf>Again, thank you for following me, Tyris.
...... But why did that old man <cf>want this?
["]I'm too old ["]and so on. <cf>Is it a souvenir of the underworld, or is it to be sold off and made into money? ......
Is it so ...... ......
You will know if you bring it back. <cf>Let's go, seniors.
Oh, gently, please. <cf>Gently, gently ......
Look, it's "Sandwind Flowers. Isn't that right?
Oh ...... oh ......! <cf>Yes, this is exactly what it is!
So the request has been fulfilled. <cf>Now then, I would like you to answer a few questions.
Why were you muttering 'Alicia bless you' <cf>?
...... while this broken head is still clear, <cf>listen to the fairy tale!
A long time ago, a very long time ago. <cf>There was a priest in the Order.
The priest had a woman whom he admired. <cf>However, she had lost most of her feelings.
The <cf>priest wanted to somehow make the woman who spends day after day expressionless like a machine smile!
It was then. Suddenly, a woman muttered <cf>["]I want to see 'The Flower of the Sand Wind' ["]"]!
It was a tiny little murmur. <cf>It was an unconscious murmur, like an exhaled breath.
By chance, a priest heard about it and set off on a long journey in search of <cf>"The Flower of the Sandwind"!
So I wandered around for a few years, I guess. <cf>I finally got the flowers and returned to the woman, but [--].
The priest was enveloped in a strange light and <cf>leaped into a strange land!
...... Yes, a strange place. The place was still the same, but <cf>the people, the culture, everything had changed.
It's as if time itself has been transcended ...... <cf>such ......
The priest traveled in search of a way to return to his original time. <cf>But everyone saw it as a delusion and took pity on the priest and ......
And so ...... the priests themselves thought it was all their own delusion and <cf>time just went on and on. ......
...... those words were muttered by the woman. <cf>If only I remember that for sure.
(After all, this old man is ......)
(Involved in the Chronogate accident: ......?)
This "Flower of the Sand Wind" is for you!
So please ...... smile at me. <cf>A fake smile is fine. Just for now, please.
Oh, um, I'm...
Is this ......?
Oh thanks for the ....... <cf>I bet that's what it would have looked like if that guy had laughed.
Now there is nothing more to be left out. <cf>I've lived to this age and my journey is finally over: ......
The Elderly ......?
It's been a long time since I've talked to you and I'm exhausted. <cf>[--]Oops, I guess I should thank you.
I am sorry, but could you please give me a moment <cf>to prepare a thank you? Yes, I would. ......
It will be delivered to the rest area at a later date. <cf>Please wait there.
Ha, ha ......
Thank you very much. Now let's go to ......
...... That old man told me to wait here. <cf>I hope he really gets paid.
A subhuman, an adventurer, and two women ......? <cf>You guys are the old guy at the bar ......
Oh!　You know him? <cf>We're here for the old man.
Yeah, that old man would have died.
What's ......?
He was that old and probably had one of his chronic illnesses. ...... <cf>But I hear his face was peaceful in death.
Was that so: ......
It's kind of like I was the last person to see him.
I've been asked to do a favor for you because of a connection I was offering [--] <cf>Looks like you guys are the right people to do it with.
I was told that you wanted to thank me for "Flowers of the Sand and Wind" ......
Ah, ah, yes. <cf>Then it must be us.
Well, here you go. I gave it to you.
Is this a ...... commemorative coin of the Order of Bapharia ......?
And it's quite old, too. <cf>Probably from the time of the first ...... founder ......
Then, after all, that old man!
Yes, I know. But now it's no longer ......
Oh, ......!
Tyris?　What's wrong?
The "Flower of the Sand and Wind" shattered: ......
...... I'm sure she delivered the flowers through you to <cf>your loved one!
We have finally reached the end of our journey. <cf>So ...... don't cry, just smile at him.
...... Well!　I'm off to the Temple for a change of heart. <cf>Maybe there's some info on the next Avaritia.
We don't have time to stand still. <cf>Don't you agree?
Oh!　You've come to the right place!
You guys [--] Gohon! <cf>I have something I need you guys to do for me.
You need a favor?　What is it?
You guys beat Avaritia, didn't you?
Huh? <cf>[--]Ah!　Einlein, you spoke!
I'm sorry ....... <cf>I was hoping you could help me: ......
What happened?
Actually, we got <cf>avaritia in the order we had planned!
[--]!　I didn't know there were others. ......
I've been studying <cf>for some time gathering information to reconfigure it into a safe sequence,
If you avoid that one, this one is impossible. <cf>If you avoid this one, you can't avoid that one, and so on and so forth.
I thought it would be <cf>faster to take down Avaritia already, but we didn't have enough manpower.
I was wondering if I should send a request to the adventurers, but I didn't think that there were so many <cf>idiots who would fight against avaritia [--]!
I see. There was a fool, and
That's right.
Let's go home, servant.
Wow!　I'm sorry, I lied! <cf>There are no more worthy adventurers than you!
It pains me to rely on you all, but ...... <cf>the congregation couldn't handle it very well. ......
And ...... I couldn't afford to delay my <cf>pilgrimage schedule any longer. ......
Of course, I'll play the gratuity! <cf>Right, Einrain-sama?
Oh, yeah, ....... <cf>Just tell Lugerio and you'll be fine.
I'll play the gratuity!
Well, if that's the case, why don't you go to ......? <cf>We can't leave the avaritia alone, can we?　Right?
Then I will take you to the site. <cf>Come outside the city when you are ready.
Mr. Einrain will stay here with you. <cf>Okay?
<span size="Big">Never &lt;/&gt;walk out, okay?
<span size="Big">...... And the face of God in Bapharia? &lt;/&gt;
Three times it's ...... ......
OK
Well, I look forward to working with you.
Omnistron is not available, so I don't know if the new avalitias are something that <cf>should be released ......
If you are causing trouble, I can't leave you alone. <cf>I will help you in any way I can.
But ...... is it safe to take that priestess named Electra to <cf>?
I'm sure it'll be fine. Or rather, isn't she a force to be reckoned with? <cf>That priestess seems to be quite skilled.
Hey, don't worry, <cf>I'll fool around with it when it comes time to release Avaritia!
Well then, seniors, please continue to work with us.
The [kosai-fu] is subsiding. ......
Shall we go? <cf>Avaritia seems to be at the "whispering cliff.
However, I am somewhat sorry. <cf>Even though it's a request, I'm sorry I put you in harm's way.
The Aberritya thing is basically a cult wiping its ass with ...... <cf>No, we should be responsible for it.
Why?　Why not?
That's because the Order has <cf>avaritia in the Holy Land.
Yes!
Eh?　Because, you see, capture and seal the avaritia, <cf>efficiently retrieve and utilize the engrams [--].
What is ......, huh?　Huh?　Huh?
Maybe you heard about this area from <cf>Einrain-sama[--].
I didn't.
No way! <cf>After being so friendly with them!
Wow, none!　Now nothing! <cf>I didn't hear anything I didn't hear. Good!　Yes, good!
It's not good!　The way you put it, <cf>the cult's definition of a holy place is [--].
Ahhhhh, I can't hear you. <cf>Yes, I can!　Let's move on!
As I recall, you once said
The ["]oracle priestesses might have more information on <cf>of avaritia ["]...... and
I see. If the Order is keeping avaritia <cf>in the Holy Land, that makes sense.
...... Remember <cf>where we first met!
A device for chrono-leaping: ...... <cf>You saw Avalitaia by the "Chronogate", didn't you?
For an accurate chronolipe, <cf>the corresponding fuel ...... chronogram is
And it takes <cf>a lot of engrams to get the Chronogate working!
So that avaritia was <cf>powering the gates ......?
Chronogate is just one example, but the engrams collected <cf>using avalitaire are used for many things!
The "Avaritia Sealing Mechanism" ...... <cf>That's the truth about the Holy Land, according to the Order!
Who are you to know that? <cf>Isn't it about time you told us?
......We'll talk again when we're done with this case.
Is that okay, Tyris?
Hey!　What are you talking so slowly? <cf>Get your ass over here!
Here they come!　It's avaritia!
...... really strong. <cf>If we're not careful, we could be in trouble too.
I did it!　It moved!
What do you think?
Biometric records matched. <cf>This is an avaritia that should be released.
The miko sister!　I just saw a <cf>Einrain-like figure over there!
Huh!　No way!
Really, really. Come with me for a minute!
I told you that the face of God in Bapharia is three times the same!
Now, we will release the avaritia
This response can be found at ......!
No way. ......!
Voldigen......！
Time is full.
(flashback recollection &amp; surprise) Ha!
Run away!
(Standing up - realizing)...huh!
(Noticed)!
(Thrown by Electra) Ugh!
Mr. Electra!
I'm done babysitting the kid.
(Surprise!)!
(Surprise.) Ha!
...... frelve?
......?　Damn, how do you know my name?
No, Mr. Aerinse!　This flerbe is [--]
(Surprise)
Shut up and stop messing around!
(Blasts flying at his feet - he looks up) Gosh ...... ha!
(Electric shock is sent to his feet.) Geez!
What's the deal with ......?
It's that simple, isn't it? <cf>You guys were tricked by me and lured here.
It was worth it for me to hide in the Order. <cf>I can be of service to Voldigen-sama in this way.
Mr. Voldigen. <cf>As reported, the woman is ready to be eaten, isn't she?
(surprise). ......
...... Yeah, more than enough.
What ......
Master Voldigen was waiting for that woman's bio-engraham to be activated <cf>by the Avalitia release.
I mean, you guys have been playing in the palm of Lord Voldigen's <cf>hand the whole time!
You will be my strength, woman.
What other [--] kind of death do you want?
...... This is quite a desperate situation!
...... I'll take Voldigen. <cf>You take Electra [--]Frelbe.
...... I'll take Voldigen. <cf>You take Electra [--]Hrelbe.
Feste must take Aerinse and run away when he sees an opening.
Feste, seeing an opening, took Aerinse and ran away.
Your servant, my lord: ......
We will survive, all of us. We will.
We will survive, all of us. We must.
(Agreed)!
Let's go!
(Accept Attack - Attack) ............ Hoo!
(Running - looking at Voldigen in the sky above) <cf>...... Taaaaah--haaah!
You are a good warrior.
(Generating fireballs - throwing) huh ...... Hun!
(Accepts fireball &amp; is blown away) Gghhhh....
(Accepting damage and unable to stand up) Ugh...
You've done well to stand your ground.
And in reward, I give you a painless death.
Mr. Aerinse ...... ......!
[--] Don't do it!
(He begins to suffer in response to the lullaby of the stars.) Ugggghhhh.
Mr. Voldigen?
Gosh, ......!
Mr. Voldigen!
(Suffer) Ah... ahhh!
The song ...... is available at ......!
Songs?　No such thing [--].
(Suffer) Ugh....hmmm...
(stands up with full wounds)--Ha--Ha--Ha.
Geez. ......!
(Suffer) Ugh... ahhh...
Mr. Voldigen!　This place is for me!
What the hell are you ...... ......
(surprised)--!
...... Oh, yeah.
Death at the hands of Master Voldigen, <cf>is too much of a prize for you!
Let the winged insects be quiet in my hands!
(Accepting the avatar's attack) Ugh ......!
Damn. ......!
Frelbe......
That memory can be found at ......
Gugu ......
Somehow you all survived.
By the way, Voldigen said <cf>"Song" ......
Is this ......?
What a mysterious Imagine Seed ......
Well, let's not do this. <cf>Let's go back to Salamzart for once.
Aerinse and Tyris must be tired. <cf>I, too, am exhausted.
...... I know, I know. Let's go back.
Fuu...... finally got back. <cf>So many things have happened, I'm tired.
......Yes, that's right. You're right, I'm not so sure this time.
Okay, I'll ask Einlein to <cf>rest in the temple [--].
No. ......
Let's keep ...... a rest stop.
There is also the matter of Electra. <cf>Let's not go near the Order for a while.
And it's not always just one dragon tribe lurking in the Order. ......
First of all, thank you for your hard work. <cf>You all managed to get through this without incident.
It's a miracle that we are here now.
Thanks to my seniors. If it were just me, maybe ......
It's strange. <cf>I feel like something like this ...... is opening up a path for me down the road.
This sound ...... from Omnistron?
No way. ......!
Can you ......?　Tyris. Response.
Mr. Bachelard!
Bachelard!　Tyris, you--
Sorry about ....... Instead of getting a chronogram, <cf>I promised to report back to you regularly ......
...... Yes, I see.
This is Tyris. We have confirmed normal reception.
We apologize for all the trouble we have caused. <cf> The impact of [kousai-fu] has been greater than expected. ......
I need to make sure of something. <cf>Is Mr. Aerinse all right?
*For audio division* Is Master Aerinse all right?
Yes, I am. There was an attack by the Dragon King Voldigen, but we survived it thanks to <cf>our helpers.
Have you already made contact with Voldigen? ...... <cf>It's [fortuitous] that you've been able to stay safe until now.
*For audio division* <cf>It's [fortuitous] that we've been able to stay safe until now.
Voldigen's chronoleap is <cf>we didn't even expect.
It is dangerous to stay in that time period any longer. <cf>The safety of Mr. Aerinse is your first priority, and you must return home immediately.
*For audio division* <cf>The safety of Mr. Aerinse is the top priority, and he must return home immediately.
But we still have to release the avalitaire at ......!
There you are, Mr. Aerinse. <cf>I am relieved to hear your voice.
We are both concerned about the future, even though we are in different processes of solving the problem. <cf>We are both concerned about the future, and we will not lie about our feelings for your safety.
For now, please follow our instructions. <cf>For the sake of our future.
Tyris. <cf>Get Master Aerinse to safety, okay?
*For audio division* <cf>Get Master Aerinse to safety, okay?
...... senpai, I have one last request. <cf>Could you please send us to [Mihashira]?
Last ......
Until we leave this time. <cf>Please stay with us at ...... at least!
If you reach the Chronogate, you can say goodbye. ...... <cf>It's been a long time and a short time.
Yes, ....... <cf>Thanks to all the seniors for their help.
......This is really the last one!
......Tyris
Hmm? <cf>What is it? What's wrong?
...... No, it's nothing. <cf>Let's go.
If you go through that portal, you'll find yourself at the Chronogate.
Good grief, it's still a big tower for nothing!
If you have any last words, this is the last time.
You see, we had a hard time too, didn't we?
What's the future - or something good, right?
You wouldn't be mad if I left you one, would you?　Hmm?
You guys keep helping me out and I can't thank you enough <cf>
So ...... at least listen to me!
The story of Aerinse, [the princess] of the divine tribe of Bapharia.
...... Bapharia Divine Tribe ......?
You are the ...... god ......?
Ha ...... haha!　What a joke at a time like this.
If you're going to lie, do it a little better.
In general, they don't look or feel any different from ordinary human beings!
This is because we humans were created by the Bapharia gods in <cf>their own image.
Yes ......?
Long ago, the Bapharia gods created <cf>weapons rich in biological engrams to win their battles against the dragon tribes!
That's [--] human beings.
But after the victory of the dragon tribe, the humans joined forces with the subhumans <cf> and rebelled against us, the gods.
We who have abandoned earth have moved beyond the sky, <cf>waiting a long time for the time when humans will repent ......
He manipulated the earthly cult in the form of an "oracle" from the heavens and <cf>turned himself into a myth!
The Avalitia Sealing Mechanism is administered by the Order. The culture of the Divine Tribe is built on <cf>engrams collected from it!
In a way, Avaritia is our lifeline!
You were letting it go, weren't you?
Were you letting it go?
The [distortion] of a bloated, out-of-control avaritia <cf>will destroy the world ......
Then I thought, I tried to <cf>what I could do [--].
Even for the good of the world, Bachelard disagreed with me that freeing Avaritia would lead to <cf>civilization's suicide!
But I didn't want to save the ...... planet and at the same time, I didn't want to take any more advantage of Avaritia, who was trapped in the cause <cf>of her own murder!
We wanted to let them go and <cf>seek a new future on top of that!
Mr. Aerinse.
Thank you for all your help so far!
As for my thoughts on the journey with the future of the planet at stake: <cf>It may be inappropriate [--].
I had a very ...... good time. <cf>I have never had so much fun in my life!
It's been a real pleasure meeting you guys: ......
......, what the heck, let's change it up.
If it's the last time, let's have fun and enjoy it!
Here, it's time to go!
Even after ......1000 years.
Don't forget about us.
(Surprised to see Bachelard.) Ha ......!
Mr. Bachelard!
I can't believe you're coming in person: ......
It is the duty of a vassal to rush to a royal family event
I am glad to hear you are safe, Aerinse.
What chronograms do you have on hand?
Ah, yes!
That's all I have.
...... Who is this person?
I am a collaborator in this period. <cf>Thanks to you, we have been able to fight off Voldigen [--].
(Bachelard blows him away.) Wow!
Servant!
(surprise) Oh...
What are you doing [--]!
(Blown away) Hey...!
Tyris！
(frightened)... ah...
Bachelard ...... you ......
(faint) U...... is ......
(Can't get up) gu...... is ......
(Can't get up) gu......ku......
Your work is done. <cf>As a reward at least, you can live in peace in this time.
Alicia bless you."
(stands up) Huh huh...
Help Aerinse at ...... ......
This voice ...... from ...... Imagine Seed?
If this continues, she will be used for the 'plan'. <cf>If that happens: ......
(Amazing) ......ッ
Looking for Charlotte. <cf>She is the way to the future. ......
Charlotte is ...... in ...... "Cartoum"
Wait!
...... has stopped talking.
What's the plan, ...... I don't think so, Mr. Bachelard, are you sure it's ......?
Wait!　Where do you think you're going?
We need to get to Khartoum as soon as possible!
If that Imagine Seed is right, <cf>Aerinse is ...... Aerinse's life is ......!
Calm down. It's not safe to go alone. I'm coming with you.
Calm down. It's not safe to go alone. I'm coming with you.
...... I'm embarrassed to even ask this now.
Where can I find Kartoum at ......?
You started running without knowing where you were!
I thought I could figure it out by looking at the map! <cf>But now that I look at it, the details are not so clear, so...
It seems that we were right to follow you, my servant. <cf>He is still confused.
U...... no face ......
Khartoum is a ruin in the desert. <cf>It is located further east of the Hermit's Fountain.
"The Fountain of the Hermits" ...... where you met York.
The Fountain of Hermits. ...... where you met York.
Hmmm. If Charlotte is in Kartoum, <cf>it may be the safe house that Einlein has set up.
It would be a problem if others found us while we were hiding. <cf>We must hurry, but we must go carefully.
I've been waiting for ......
Waiting for us?　Did you know we were coming?
Einlein was Accepted by the "oracle."
He told me to bring Charlotte here <cf>to help you ......
...... If you, <cf>, have been so cooperative with us so far, is that an "oracle"?
Who the hell are you really ......?
[You may eventually come across something that connects <cf>to your memory.
[My name is Aerinse.
[--] To save this planet!
I want to help Aerinse to know that ......
I want to help Aerinse to know that ......
We were told to meet Mr. Charlotte. <cf>Lady Aerinse was kidnapped, and so [--].
I just have to give you this pendant, right?
I'm not sure, but you need the contents of ...... this, right?
Bullshit ....... <cf>How did such a high purity chronogram get here!
What?　What? What? <cf>Is that a great thing, that?
It's amazing and nothing but one of these <cf>will make change for all of us to chronolypse!
Black Nori-pu?
（Oh...
And anyway, with this <cf>I can go help Mr. Aerinse!
Thank you. I promise I'll pay you back later.
Thank you. I promise I'll pay you back later.
(Responding to Avatar's line) Yeah.
Good luck to all of you in your fight.
Let's go, senpai. <cf>Let's go to the "Pillar of Divinity. Go from there.
Hey, you, <cf>, what's up with this pendant?
I was not expecting to be named by the oracle of Einlein: ....... <cf>You are all strange people.
Speaking of which, did you have <cf>business in Carvein?
No, I got your names from Einrain at <cf>and we came here together.
For some reason, I felt I had to see you all once <cf>before I returned to my home country.
Hmmm... ......?　I don't know what it is, but <cf>if you need help, let me know.
And Carvein and Einrain are no strangers to <cf>each other.
Well, not right now, of course.
Yes, I'm sure you all have things to do.
I will do what I can, in my own way. <cf>If that is still not enough, please let me consult with you.
Take care. <cf>Good luck to all of you in your fight.
Now, what dangers await you in the future. ...... <cf>Be prepared for anything!
The man who took Aerinse, ...... <cf>I believe he said Bachelard.
What is your relationship to that?
...... Master Bachelard is my superior officer in <cf>"Zolksia"
Can we say that it is an ideological group ......? <cf>It's a group to which many powerful people within the Divine Tribe belong.
My father and grandfather have always been Zolksia. <cf>So it's not surprising that I'm also ......
Master Aerinse's power has been a <cf>problem inside Zolksia for some time!
I'm close to my age and was told to serve Master Aerinse <cf>including escorting and ...... monitoring him.
But as we spent time together, <cf>I came to truly want to serve.
I was touched by Mr. Aerinse's sentiments ...... <cf>and I also couldn't leave a little bit of danger behind.
And yet ...... I ......!
Tyris's feelings are being properly conveyed to Aerinse.
Let's go help. Together.
[--]Yes!
Is this your time?
Yes, it looks like they were able to jump safely. <cf>As expected of a high-purity chronogram, there was plenty of room even for three people!
Why would Charlotte want to ...... such a thing? <cf>He's a mystery to me, too, with the strange group that attacked him.
I am concerned, but right now we have to rescue Mr. Aerinse first. <cf>Anyway, let's move on.
(OFF action scene) Ooooh!
(OFF action scene) Eat!
(OFF action scene) Jamakusei!
(Action scene) Orah!
(Rising) Hun.
Hrelbe!　Why is he here?
Please calm down! <cf>That flerbe is on our side.
You say you're on our side?　What are you talking about?
(To Tyris, who starts walking away without answering the question.) <cf>Hey!
<span size="Big">Too late, Tyris! &lt;/&gt; What the hell did you do?
I'm sorry, but Mr. Aerinse is!
They took him to a research facility down the road! <cf>Don't dawdle, let's go!
An ......?　Hey. What's with those guys?
People who helped us in the past. <cf>They came together to help Master Aerinse.
(Isn't this guy that Frelbe? <cf>Why are you helping us ......?)
(She was found in suspended animation a few years ago. <cf>She had lost all memory prior to that. ......)
(There was a lot going on, but Aerinse-sama protected him and <cf>now he serves as a [kinji], just like me.
（I see. (I see. So you are on our side. <cf>They don't even remember us.)
......I'm kind of itching to see you guys. ...... <cf>It's like old wounds are tingling. ......
No, it's just your imagination, isn't it?　Faces like ours are common everywhere at <cf>, aren't they?
Well, that's okay. Welcome to our side. Let's smash Bachelard's fool <cf>with his whole stupid 'plan'.
I don't know, I think it's called "The Plan". ....... As Tyris said, <cf>what the hell is that?
...... "Avaritia Shell Project."
Simply put, the plan is to create a special avalitaire to control <cf>other avalitaire
Oh, that's not possible!
In theory. However, to manipulate the avaritia shell, <cf>special biological engrams must be incorporated
The power to be in tune with <cf>avaritia while having a human heart [--].
That's no way. ......
Yes, ...... it's Mr. Aerinse.
The plan is to make Aerinse the head of <cf>Aerinse in order to control Aberitya.
Huh?　Aerinse is your [princess], isn't she? <cf>You can't do that!
Of course, it was rejected. It was also unclear whether the avaritia could be controlled <cf>reliably, and ......
We finally settled on Master Aerinse leaping into the past <cf>and releasing Aberritya!
Master Bachelard also said that he respects ["][the Princess's] wishes["] and ....... <cf>Certainly, it was not pleasant. ......
That was to get Mr. Aerinse to release the avaritia <cf>and activate the biological engram, apparently!
He said that would increase the rate of fusion with the avaritia shell. <cf>So, all of this is exactly what Bachelard is trying to do.
Such is the case with ......!
So much for the story. <cf>Let's hurry to the institute before Bachelard gets his ass handed to him!
I hope the portal on the first floor works. ...... <cf>If not, I'll just have to bet on [a.][le... ......
It's locked!
This is not the way forward. ......
Then [--]
You're back, Tyris. <cf>You should have lived in peace in that time.
You can't do that! <cf>Please give us back Master Aerinse!
Are you crazy if you think you're going to sacrifice the [Imperial princess] or <cf>?
Rather, the sacrifice of one [imperial princess] will save everyone. <cf>Isn't it the duty of the royal family to give themselves up for that?
Even if you can use a shell to control the bloat of other avalitiers <cf>, it does not solve the problem at the root!
A temporary response doesn't make sense. <cf>We need to erase the very existence of avaritia [--].
...... Oh, right. <cf>I only disclosed that much information to you.
The Beast of [Planet (Star)], ...... <cf>That's what caused the distortion of avaritia to become so bloated.
The disaster that destroyed the old civilization? A fairy tale at a time like this?
The beast of [planet] is real. In an "imaginary world" cut off from this world's time <cf>
The defense mechanism of "Planet Regnus", which appears <cf>when a highly developed civilization is found to be harmful to the planet [--].
It's connected to Avaritia through the imaginary world, which <cf>can never be erased.
This Avaritia Shell Project is the root cause <cf>[planet (star)] to control the beast!
What the heck is ......!
If the plan succeeds, we can secure the future of our planet without abandoning our civilization <cf>in fear of the beast!
Our technology also supports the prosperity of Regnus. <cf>It is a bright path for all species living on earth, isn't it?
What does Tyris want?　That's the most important thing.
What does Tyris want?　That's the most important thing.
I am a senior ....... <cf>.................. I am ......
I want to help Master Aerinse! <cf>I don't think the way to sacrifice someone is bright!
...... Looks like you're the one who made Tyris stronger.
Let's hear how you guys procured the chronograms at <cf>later!
You're a Zolksia fighter. <cf>No choice, I'll hold them off here. You guys go on ahead!
But how can I ......
There should be a wall ahead that is being repaired. <cf>From there we can sneak in to Bachelard's place.
It's the remains of my old rampage. I did <cf>a pretty big hole in it, so it's not quite fully restored yet.
Go, go, go! <cf>If you wait too long, the soldiers will come!
Frelbe was right. <cf>Now we can move on!
Let's go!　Let's go save Mr. Aerinse!
(Running) ha...... ha...... ha......
(Finding Aerinse) Ha!
Dear Aerinse!
Ha!　Tyris stop!
(Turning around when called out) Ha!
(Blown away - butt hurt) Wow! ......
(Looking at the enemy) Damn!
oh!
(Runs - stops and surprises) haha ......
(Runs - stops and almost falls over in surprise) <cf>haha ...... wow!
Dear Aerinse!
(begins to remove the tentacles entangled in Aerinse) gg......
(Continues to remove the tentacles entangled in Aerinse) gg............
(Surprise!)!
(Continues to remove the tentacles entangled in Aerinse) gg......
(pulling Aerinse away from his tentacles)
(Tentacles catch me)
Tirith!
It's a freak accident. It's going out of control. Pull it off!
(surprise) haha ......!
(Runs - gets blown away) <cf>ha ...... ha ...... ha ...... oh my!
(Trying to remove the tentacles that wrap around him) <cf>u...... u...... u...... u......
Tyris......？
Dear Aerinse, ...... run away ......
(Running - Jumping) <cf>hah ...... hah ...... hah ...... guh--!
(Reaches out his hand) ......!
ahead of ...... seniors......
(Sucked into avalitaire shell) <cf>ah ...... ah ......
(Endure the roar and shock.) <cf>Guh ......! --gghh!
(withstand the roar and shock) <cf>or ...... ku ......
(withstand the roar and shock) <cf>is ...... oh ......
Disappeared ......?
He jumped without a chronogram?
And ...... this is ......
(stands up) haha ......
When is ...... ......
Oh, hey, take it easy!
Answer!　Where did that thing that took in Tyris jump to <cf>!
......The projected era is 1000 years ago. <cf>You jumped, that time period.
(exasperated, walks away holding his arm in pain) <cf>Damn ......
(Looking at Aerinse) ah......
If you are going to help, you might as well give up. <cf>Accepting Shell's outburst, space-time is being disrupted.
To chronoleap now would be suicide.
You caused this! <cf>Can't you do something about it!
...... at ...... unworthy
(Controlling his indignation) ......
I'll see what I can do.
(turning around) Oh, ......
You ...... are you sure Merlouf ......? <cf>Why are you here ......
Thanks for remembering my name.
Are you ...... a "wanderer"?
You are indeed an executive of Zolksia. <cf>You know who I am?
Then [--] it's in your best interest to cooperate, right?
Hey, kid!　Don't just show up out of the blue and let me show you the way <cf>and then proceed on your own!
Dear Aerinse, I hope you are safe!
I mean, what?　Where's Tyris?
Tyris is ...... in my place ......
Totally, you did it. <cf>I can't believe you made a puppet like that and connected it to the beast.
The thing's out of control and even the beast has been activated. <cf>At this rate, this planet's civilization will perish in the near future.
The act of creating the future destroys the future. <cf>Truly, man is a fool.
But [--] still, I have to help you guys.
We're going to the Chronogate. <cf>I'll make you jump.
Huh?　What are you--
Trust me. <cf>Of course, you'll help me, won't you, Uncle?
...... is no help at all
Well, and [--]
You guys stay here. <cf>I need your help with something.
...... would be a good way to buy some time.
Now go. We don't have much time.
Is space-time stable ......?
See, we managed, didn't we?
Avaritia shell, was it? <cf>It'll be 'out' at the forecast point soon.
You can look for me when you go back in time. <cf>Maybe you know where Shell appears.
I'd be at <cf>Asterleeds in that era.
*For audio splits* <cf>I'm in Asterleeds.
Who in the world are you, my dear? <cf>Are you one of the Bapharia gods?
My name is Merlouf. I'm just a wanderer.
See, there's no time to get lost.
Quickly, while space-time is stable.
(eye contact with Aerinse) ......
Please use this chronogram. <cf>I'll also give you the new Omnistron.
Bachelard......
In terms of capturing avaritia shells, <cf>our goals are aligned. There is no need to fight.
We will do everything we can to support you in the future.
...... you are always right. <cf>Even your choice to work with us now.
I know what is best. <cf>You were my teacher, even if only temporarily. But ......
We join hands with you.
But I will never forgive you for putting Tyris in danger <cf>
......That's why I'm the proud [princess] of Bapharia!
You will stay here and keep an eye on Bachelard and the others.
Ha!　Please be careful.
Let's go back. Back to your time.
The bastard child of hope. Show me your fight.
(Responding to Merlouf's words) ......
I see you are back.
Huh ...... I'm so tired all at once ......
Is that ...... good? <cf>If you continue to cooperate with us, you can still ......
You guys just got involved ......
Tyris is one of us.
Tyris is one of us.
Thank you for ....... ......
All right, let's go find Merlouf as soon as possible. <cf>We'll meet at the settlement office in Asterleeds.
Is it still the same ...... as usual? <cf>It's like you've gone to the future. ......
Hey, why don't we drop by Coin-tei for a bit? <cf>I'd like to say hello to your husband.
Just so you know, it's never because I 'want to eat food' or <cf>anything like that, okay?　It's also to gather information!
(Embarrassed by his stomach)
All right. Okay, I'll leave the rest to you.
What, are you going out?
Yeah, kind of: ......
Husband, we have all the ingredients.
Well, you can spend the rest as you like. <cf>Oh, and make sure you pay Jake for what you spent.
What's keeping you busy?
It's been like that for a while now. <cf>He's been in and out of the store. ......
Today, they finally said they were going to close the store.
What the hell?　Close this place! <cf>Why so suddenly?
Don't worry. I'll take care of that for you. <cf>We've agreed on that. This is a place for adventurers to relax.
But ...... dad, <cf>I hope you're not involved in anything strange ......
...... I don't think so, but <cf>it's not an effect of us going to the future, is it ......?
Hey, anything else unusual? <cf>Anything. Anything, even the smallest thing.
Why? Uhhhh... ...... Yeah... ......... <cf>Oh yeah. Did you hear about the assassins of the Prince?
The assassin of the Prince? <cf>Bernhardt's Prince is recovering from an illness, is he not?
Hey, hey, when did you get that information? <cf>The Lord King was assassinated during the attack on the principality by the dragon clans.
So, the main culprit, Carvein, a member of the Order, <cf>is hiding out in Asterleeds, and there's a commotion [--].
Carvein assassinated the Duke!
Oh?　Yeah. You haven't seen the handbill? <cf>That's quite a bounty, huh?
What do you mean ......? When we were there <cf>, there was no assassination of the King. ......?
[Wait a minute. There's a guest. <cf>Sorry, my husband's not home right now.
...... No way, history has changed ......?
I don't see Carvein as the kind of guy <cf>who would assassinate the Lord King ......
He didn't look that smart to me! <cf>If anything, I think York would be more likely to do it.
...... Maybe it has something to do with the avaritia shell jumping to <cf>here: ......
Let's hurry up and find Merlouf. <cf>If you're looking for someone, it's best to ask at the settlement office.
Let me ask you something. I'm looking for someone. ......
Hmm?　Are you also looking for the assassin of the Prince?
That's a lot these days. Well, I hear there's quite a bounty on you, and I'm sure <cf>adventurers would be interested.
No, we're not looking for Carvein, we're looking for a guy named <cf>Merlouf.
He's a bit of an eccentric boy. <cf>He should be somewhere in Asterleeds.
Are you Mr. Merlouf? ....... I'll look into it for you.
Hmmm ...... I can't think of anyone. <cf>I don't think they've been to the Pioneer Station.
Hmmm, I see. <cf>Is there any mention of seeing him anywhere?
Yes, I know. If you're a member of the town gate plaza guard, <cf>might have an idea of what I'm talking about.
The assassins of the Lord King may be hiding here. <cf>We are increasing our patrols and security.
They're checking people in and out, <cf>and even the Knights of Bernhardt are joining the patrol.
It seems to be a direct order from Knight Commander Dunkirk. <cf>It's hard to do, because it's like we're being stared at.
Dunkirk also has Carvein at ....... <cf>Is it still true that the duke was assassinated ......?
[No, there's nothing we can do about it now. <cf>It's more about Merlouf and the avaritia shell.
Let's go to the town gate square. <cf>Ask the gatekeeper if he knows anything about it.
Sorry to bother you. <cf>I'm looking for a man named Merlouf.
He dressed a little differently and was <cf>what can I say, an eccentric boy. ......
It's in the style of .......
Hmmm, haven't seen them around here.
Do you have any idea what the Knights of Columbus are doing?
Hmmm ....... I think I may have seen him during my rounds. <cf>He seemed like a somewhat out-of-this-world boy.
Oh, that could be him!　Where could he be?
Arena. I tried to talk to him, but he was talking <cf>in a roundabout way and didn't get the point.
Well, we decided that there was no harm done. ......
Just to be clear, this Merlouf fellow. <cf>I'm sure you're not related to the assassin of the king?
That's not true. If there were, I wouldn't have <cf>asked you where he is right in front of you.
That's right, too. ....... My apologies. <cf>Circumstances being what they are, I hope you understand.
You are very tense. <cf>I still can't believe that you would assassinate the king.
But it's true. The Guard and the Pioneer Bureau have also received a request for cooperation from the <cf>Knights of the Order.
I hope they find the assassin soon and <cf>things calm down.
Yes, that's right. ....... <cf>Sorry to have disturbed you. I'm glad you told me.
Well, let's look around the Arena!
Hey, long time no see. <cf>...... looks like you've grown since the last time I saw you.
After all, <cf>you are more efficient ...... than the people here?
You are still talking nonsense. <cf>Now let's hear what we have to say.
Tell me. Where is the Avaritia Shell?
You told me that 1000 years from now. He said he would <cf>know where Avalitia Shell was!
A thousand years later I ...... Oh, yeah, I see ....... <cf>So that's what that reaction was then.
...... Did you guys make that thing?
Huh?　You've got to be kidding me!　If I had the technology to make something like that <cf>, I'd convert it to make money first!
Yeah, well, yeah. <cf>That's how you guys do it.
...... Good for you. <cf>The creators of that stuff are not you guys.
If I had, [--] <cf>I would have killed him without even using him.
If you've got advice for me in a thousand years, that means you're here <cf>to do something about that thing ......
Then there is no reason for me to refuse to cooperate now. <cf>If I don't do something about it, civilization will perish.
Please tell me about ....... <cf>Where is the avaritia shell?
It was about 6 months ago. An anomalous outbreak of engrams was seen in the basement of <cf>"St. Bapharia's Island".
Maybe that's what you're looking for.
Avaritia Shell crossed <cf>space-time without a chronogram. That's why the coordinates were off!
So history has changed in that six-month period. ......
Let's head to the basement of St. Bapharia Island. We need to check the status of <cf>avaritia shell as soon as possible!
If you want to go to the basement of St. Bapharia ...... "[Sanctuary of Blessings]" <cf>, you can go from the temple of Asterleeds.
Sanctuary of Blessings" is the home of the Bapharia cult. <cf>They probably have at least a transporter there.
I forget how many times I've asked you this. <cf>Who the hell are you?
He doesn't even pretend to be surprised when he hears about his future self. <cf>He will still look the same in 1000 years. ......
And as for the identity of this guy, <cf>there seems to be some implication. Come on, can't you just tell us?
What's the matter? There's nothing here.
<span size="Big">He got away! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, oh, oh, I hate myself for falling for this childish trick <cf>　I'm so angry I can't do anything about it!
Calm down. Anyway, use <cf>Asterleeds' temple as you were taught!
Yes, it is. But will ...... really <cf>let us use it so easily? ......
You said that the Sanctuary of Blessings can be accessed at <cf>by using the transporter in this temple.
Yes ...... there, Avaritia Shell ...... <cf>No, you have Tyris.
Mm ...... <cf>I'll have to use the transporter first.
Let's go talk to the most important guy in the room.
...... I see. That matches the figure that Mr. Einrain mentioned <cf>
I am Lugerio, chief priest of Asterleeds. <cf>By the oracle, I obey you.
This way, please. <cf>I will take you to the "Sanctuary of Blessings.
The oracle has made the Order follow the eagles ......?
Yes, I am. If that is the revelation Accepted by the oracle priestess.
The God of Bapharia needs your help now. <cf>We are only obeying God's word.
Is the god of Bapharia ......?　Perhaps ......
For more information, please visit <cf>Mr. Einrain at the Cathedral.
Let's go to ......
This warding works on ...... biological engrams ......?
I've been waiting: ......
Just to be sure, do you remember us?
[About [raija] ...... or <cf> Permit to enter [Pillar of Divinity] ...... or 
Nothing seems to have changed around here.
By the way, why are these boundaries ......?
This is to put to sleep <cf>God's [messenger] inside ......
Perhaps an avaritia shell is in this one!
Avaritia Shell ......?
Oh, no, how long have these [mitsuka] cousins been here?
Six months ago I suddenly found myself here ....... <cf>You have to be warded or it will happen. ......
No, it's not safe.
Don't stop!　I must see it with my own eyes!
Inside, there's a monster.
(Notice) ......ッ
You are hindering us from approaching [the Messenger].
Because of that we can only ward <cf>from here
If this continues, God's [messenger] will eventually wake up and ......
God wants your strength.
God's desire is to get rid of the monster within and to suppress the wrath of the <cf>[messenger(mitsuka)]ini
To those who have done so, pledge your allegiance to ...... and ......
...... Bachelard. <cf>This oracle is probably the one he ......
That's what I mean: ......
All right. Let's knock out that monster or whatever it is inside and save Tyris.
I guess [Mitsuka] ...... <cf>avaritia shell be in the back of this place.
I hope Tyris is ok. ......
Hm ......?
Looks like a dead end ......
Maybe this is it: ......
Woohoo! ......!　What the hell?
(Surprise - turn around)
This is the one! <cf>The monster that Einlein was talking about!
It's ...... again.
May I have your permission to ......?
Yeah, that's messy. Servant, do it again!
That's ......! <cf>Avaritia Shell!
(Noticing and avoiding enemy attacks) Ha ......!
What the hell is this guy? <cf>He's clearly not the same as those guys from earlier!
You don't mean ...... for ...... vs. dragon tribes? <cf>Even something like this ......!
O God of Bapharia, show us your power!
This will be ...... for a while ......
Chosen by the God. <cf>I can't believe you beat that monster. ......
(Notice) ......
On behalf of the oracle priestess, I thank you.
As it was, it was only a matter of time <cf>before the [MITSUKA] go on a rampage. God must be very pleased.
But that's only temporary. <cf>He seems to be sleeping now[--].
He will eventually wake up and ...... <cf>take Tyris in completely. ......
We need to find a way to separate them somehow: ......
Hey, ......, what if... <cr>
If there is no way to do that, then ......
By the avaricious shell that has taken in Tyris, <cf>the world is ......
What will you ...... do then?
You can enter the "Ritual Room" from here.
Would you like to go to the "Ritual Room"?
You can return to the "Seimei no Ma (purification room)" from here.
Would you like to go back to the "purification room"?
Oh, you are ....... <cf>Mr. Lugerio has told us all about you.
This way, please. <cf>[We will take you to the [Sanctuary of Blessings].
Einlein, do we have to keep warding <cf>here?
The rest of the congregation is only an aid. <cf>This is a ward that only an oracle priestess can create.
If Einrain were to leave this place, <cf>there will be a [tear] in the boundary, and it will collapse in the not-too-distant future.
Then it can't stay this way forever, <cf>
We need to find a way to separate <cf>Tyris from the avaritia shell as soon as possible. ......
(Noticing communication) Oh, ......
I will leave you now. I am usually at the <cf>Temple in Asterleeds, so please feel free to contact me at any time!
(Looking at Lugerio as he leaves) Hmmm...
It will be troublesome if they ask. <cf>Let's talk about it over there.
[--]This is Bachelard. <cf>Mr. Aerinse, please respond if you can.
Aerinse. <cf>How are things going over there?
Since Mr. Aerinse's chronoleap, <cf>space-time has begun to be disrupted again!
Currently, it would be <cf>impossible to send reinforcements from here!
Therefore, the oracle was sent from the divine family of that time period. <cf>For the time being, please make the cult your base.
As for Voldigen, we are following developments at <cf>. We will contact you if there is any movement.
So now we can say that the common enemy is the dragon tribe ....... <cf>Until we help Tyris, that is.
With your understanding, I would like to ask Mr. Aerinse to release <cf>Aberritya
(Surprise!) ......
It would be the effect of the shell jumping that way. In that time period, <cf>there should be an avaritia showing extreme outliers!
Accepting past changes, we are <cf>more bloated than before in these times. Please release it before it becomes an obstacle.
...... Bachelard? <cf>You, do you have any memories left from before the historical change?
Unless you were the party who did the chronoleaping, <cf>you can't recognize the effects of a revised history. ......
[We don't have time for unnecessary chit-chat. <cf>If you want to save the stars, act quickly.
What do we do?　Bachelard is right. <cf>Shall we go liberate Aberritya?
That's the only way now.
That's the only way to go now.
Aerinse. Do you know where Avaritia is?
Uh, yes.
...... here!　There's a response near <cf>"The Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon" in Montegnor Valley.
Oh ......?　I've been trying to reach Omnistron.
...... from Bachelard?
&lt;As part of a cooperative effort, send information to <cf>regarding the following
&lt;About the causes of avaritia bloat.
&lt;The bloat in Avaritia is caused by the influence of the <cf>"[planetary (star)] beast" in the imaginary world.
＜As you know, Avaritia is born through chronoleap <cf>"self-killer".
＜They are distortions, disconnected from time.
&lt;That's why Avaritia is now connected to the <cf>imaginary world, which has no concept of time.
＜The beast of the planet is steadily awakening. <cf>Accepting its influence, the distortion of Avaritia also grows.
＜Sooner or later, it will be enough to swallow the world.
＜There are two ways to end the situation. <cf>One is to abandon civilization and stop the awakening of the beast.
＜The other is to control the beast itself.
＜Which is more beneficial to mankind? <cf>I hope you will consider once again. That is all.
You're still talking so smugly.
But I see that doesn't change the <cf>idea of what to do with the beast on [planet] Hoshi!
I understand Bachelard's concern. <cf>The liberation of avaritia will eventually lead to the abandonment of civilization.
I'm sure that was the plan to avoid that, though: ......
What is really the right path? I think we have to keep thinking <cf>
Release this avalitaire!
Let's begin the ...... avaritia liberation ceremony!
So that's 5 avalitiers released. <cf>I hope the future holds some positive influences.
No, you can't say it's a good influence ....... <cf>It's a valuable resource for you guys.
Yes ....... That's why Bachelard was against <cf>the liberation of the Avalitia: ......
And yet you let Avaritia go. <cf>The future is not looking so good, is it ......?
......a......
Oh, no. I have to give Aerinse a break. <cf>I'm sure he'll be at ...... somewhere. Let's go to Litze.
Can I get a good rest here?
Thank you very much. But before I do, I will contact <cf>Bachelard.
This is Aerinse. Do you copy?
...... confirms normal reception. This is Bachelard. <cf>By the looks of it, the avaritia release was successful?
Yes, I just released the one you specified.
...... I see. The reaction is indeed gone. <cf>Now one of the most recent threats is gone.
Now, let me report on the current situation. <cf>Since our time, the future is no longer observable.
What ......?　Well, what kind of ...... is that?
We are in a situation where we could perish at any time. ...... <cf>
...... because of the ...... avaritia shell fused with <cf>Tyris.
Then go back to the past! <cf>If we can stop the fusion of Tyris and Shell, we will be able to ......!
I told you. That space-time is not stable. <cf>And [--] I'm already practicing that much.
Practice ......?
...... Don't tell me you've been chrono-leaping in a time and space disruption?
Several people were sacrificed. <cf>We didn't get the results we wanted.
--I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand!　Why are you being so reckless?
We have no time <cf>to worry about human life in the face of the existence of the planet. Except your life, Mr. Aerinse.
Bachelard......！
Mr. Aerinse should only consider <cf>separating Tyris from the shell in that era!
......, unknown collaborator. <cf>Protect Master Aerinse with all your might.
You don't have to tell me. <cf>But I will not give you Aerinse.
You don't have to tell me. <cf>But I will not give you Aerinse.
Fluor......
No need for you to apologize. <cf>Let us do what we can do!
[Let's go back to [Sanctuary of Blessings]. <cf>We can't risk Tyris or the future anymore ......!
How is Tyris doing?
It's ok ...... now he's sleeping ......
...... Did the Avalitia defeat go well?
How did you know that? <cf>You didn't hear me!
Wrong. The oracle ....... <cf>["]Cooperate with you now more than ever ["]," and
Ah, oh, I see. I see. ....... <cf>An oracle, how convenient.
...... right now, we don't have the information you guys need. <cf>No, but ......
...... if you don't mind. <cf>I would like you to go check on Carvein and Charlotte.
Carvein. By the way, you're being hunted for assassinating the Lord King <cf>......
I haven't heard from him since we broke up in Kartoum.
He didn't assassinate the high king. <cf>But ...... the world doesn't think so because ......
All right, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.
Okay, I got it. I got it.
Thank you ......
Carvein and Charlotte's hideout is <cf>near the Khartoum ruins ......
A place called "Kartoum Sandway". <cf>But the path is dangerous. ......
I have nothing to be afraid of with me and my servant! <cf>I'll make sure to see them both in good health!
It's around here. <cf>Carvein and his friends are hiding out...
By the way, Mr. Carvein was hiding from the Knights of Bernhardt in the previous history <cf>
Hmmm. At the time, you were sniffing around <cf>something in collusion with York. ......
This time, it's the "assassin of the king". <cf>The Knights must be looking at us in a different light.
Well, don't look so serious. <cf>No news is good news.
Well, I believe you said "Kartoum Sandway" <cf>
They might be bored, too. <cf>It's been a while since I've seen them.
Carvein and Charlotte should be <cf>hiding in the back here.
Let's make sure they're okay.
(notice). ......!
(Notice) ......!
(Noticing) Oh.
Oh, man, you struck out! <cf>Where the hell is that Carvein guy?
Let's go after him. <cf>He's got a woman with him. He can't get far.
Damn! <cf>I should have played with the cultists from the beginning.
I could have gone berserk over there. <cf>You made me have to go through a lot of trouble!　...... hmm?
Hey!　Those of you sneaking around in there! <cf>Come out for a minute.
(Surprised that the enemy knows)!
(Surprised that the enemy found out.) Ah!
(Surprised that the enemy found out)!
Oh, no, we can't avoid a battle. <cf>Servants, let's beat these people to death!
Looks like he got away. ...... <cf>Oh dear. The Order of Bernhardt has fallen.
Those people came to capture Mr. Carvein, didn't they? <cf>But ......
Neither Carvein nor Charlotte were <cf>in sight. Where in the world ......
I'm also concerned about their whereabouts. ...... <cf>Didn't the Knights of the Round Table say something strange?
["]If I had played with the cultists, I could have gone on a <cf>clear rampage["]......
...... That's kind of a disgusting turn of phrase. <cf>Did something happen between the Order and the Knights?
Mm ....... Anyway, I'll have to report back to Einlein <cf>Let's get back to Asterleeds for now!
Hmm? <cf>......What's wrong with the city?
If you ask me, you seem to be more buzzed than usual ......? <cf>Let me ask you all a few questions.
I heard there was an incident at the Temple!
I don't know the details either, but I do know that <cf>there were several injured guards!
I wonder if the rumor is true that the oracle priestess and the wanted criminal were meeting <cf>in secret?
If that's true, is that story true too?
If you don't want to be in danger <cf>you should stay away from the temple now.
Of course I'll stay away. <cf>I don't want to be an enemy of the Principality. ......
Hmmm, something must have happened at the temple. <cf>Okay, let's go talk to Lugerio.
[Block the way from the [Sanctuary of Blessings]. <cf>Do not let anyone from the Principality come here.
Also, urgently dispatch messengers to Larpal and Salamzart to request <cf>reinforcements!
What's going on? <cf>This doesn't look like anything out of the ordinary. ......
Emergency. The Duchy of Bernhardt has declared war against <cf>the Order.
Moreover, the oracle priestess ...... <cf>was taken away by Master Einrain!
Why is this happening? <cf>What happened while we were gone?
It was all too sudden. The Duchy of Bernhardt declared us <cf>a heretical religion that uses avaritia!
Moreover, they were even a dangerous group that was behind the assassination of King Norbert and <cf>the takeover of the duchy. ......
Master Einrain was forcibly captured <cf>for aiding the assassins of the Duke. There were some fatalities in the process.
Terrible ......
Wait. If Einlein has been taken away, then <cf>what about the warding of the cathedral!
The few remaining members of the congregation are holed up and maintaining it. <cf>But ......
Without Einrain-sama, the wards will eventually collapse, and <cf>[Mitsuka]ika will wake up. ......
Tyris......！
Let's hurry to the cathedral!
It is currently on lockdown. From the cathedral to here <cf>The Knights of the Duchy may ride in.
We are no longer in contact with Bernhardt Parish. <cf>On top of this, we cannot afford to lose the Temple of Asterleeds ......
So the Order is out of options. ......
If we don't do something about it, Tyris will ...... the world, too. <cf>How in the world can we ......
The Bapharia cult could never get into <cf>the Principality of Bernhardt face to face.
If we are not careful, it will lead to war. <cf>But if we negotiate too long, the wards won't hold.
That leaves only one option: ....... <cf>We, who have nothing to do with it, will have to act on our own.
Let's go save Einlein. <cf>There is no time to lose!
Let's go save Einlein. <cf>There is no time to lose!
We have to use force against a priestess of the oracle. <cf>We can't afford to dilly-dally. We must leave immediately.
We need a ship to sneak in. <cf>A ship that will carry us regardless of the cult: ......
Jake is the one to talk about this! <cf>He's got a lot of face. I'm sure he knows who owns the boat.
Aerinse, you are still recovering. <cf>You should go to the temple for shelter.
Instead, I will see to it that he is well taken care of. <cf>I don't feel safe with just one servant.
I understand ....... Please be safe.
Let's go see Jake. He's supposed to be at the Coin Pavilion <cf>taking care of the husband's absence.
Please!　I was told by <cf>Myulie that you could help me out!
Charlotte ......?　You, why are you here!
You guys can go to ......! <cf>That's our line. Why are you here!
Where's Carvein?　Not with you?
Hey, wait a minute. <cf>Carvein is ...... that assassin of the Lord King!
Carvein didn't assassinate anyone!
He was framed!　So is Einlein! <cf>Neither of them did anything wrong!
Relax. We know he's not a bad guy <cf>. What the hell is going on?
...... Carvein learned of the Order's plan to attack the Order and <cf>rode alone into the Principality to help Einlein.
Even I am being hunted by the Principality, but I am ....... <cf>They told me that I was ["]dangerous, so they had to hide me in the temple."]
But I don't want to do that!　You both owe me a favor. <cf>I want to help you too. So [--]
...... Is that why you are looking for a boat? <cf>To go to the Principality and save them both?
...... I'm so confused. If you look at me with such [sincere] eyes, <cf>I can't say no!
OK, I'll lend a hand. But I'm coming with you. <cf>I can't put Lady in harm's way alone!
It's not in my nature to judge people based on rumors. <cf>Let's see if this Carvein is a good guy or a bad guy with our own eyes.
Thank you ......!　Thank you, Jake!
By the way, Jake. Do you have room for a couple more people on the boat you're renting <cf>?
Oh, you guys. ...... the assassin of the Lord King and the Priestess of the Oracle. <cf>This one seems more complicated than I thought.
All right...I'll talk to a captain I know. <cf>Come to the port when you're ready.
The reward is ...... yes. You can tell my dear Myulie about <cf>my saga.
Ok, I'll tell him. I'll let them know your mind has moved on to a new woman.
No, I'm sure Miss Charlotte is lovely, but <cf>I'm all about her!　Don't be like that!
Oh, you thought it was cute?
Bubka you, don't do that!　Don't say it! <cf>Don't ever say that!
Yes! I've spoken to the captain. <cf>Let's take this boat to Bernhardt!
No, wait. This is a trading ship, right? <cf>You're going to sail into Bernhardt's harbor with impunity?
No way. We'll sneak off on the way. <cf>There's a fishing village near the castle called Kanaloa. There.
Oh, I see. You're good, aren't you? <cf>I guess the "top of the top" sign isn't all it's cracked up to be.
...... but what about the sailors? <cf>I can't seem to find them: ......
That's the problem. <cf>We got the captain, but we didn't have the right crew.
These are the times, right?　With the regular boats being stopped, <cf>who would go all the way to Bernhardt? ......
Either you're very stupid, or you're very fierce. ......
All right, all right. We'll take care of the crew. <cf>You and Charlotte will get the ship ready to sail.
OK! But, do you have a sailor's prospect?
I can't think of any right off the top of my head, but I'm sure many of us have lost our jobs <cf>because we couldn't get out to sea.
Servant, I'll run all over town to find out who it is.
I don't care what your background or situation is. <cf>I don't care what your situation is, what your background is, whatever it is!
The men of the port have all gone ashore because of the sea blockade by the Duchy of Bernhardt. <cf>
Thanks to you, I can't even do my job. <cf>I'm too scared of soldiers and knights to go out to sea!
The way you talk ...... you are a sailor if I may ask?
We are similar. I'm a ship's engineer.
No matter how old or how jaded, <cf>there isn't an engine I can't train!
As long as you get a boat, I'll take you anywhere you want to go. <cf>As long as we get out.
For example, ...... even the Duchy of Bernhardt or something like that?
Did you not listen to ......? <cf>Bernhardt is the one who stopped the liner, remember?
What in the world were you thinking ...... <cf>that you were going to ignore that and get in?
I like you guys! <cf>I like to go out to sea with guys like that!
Give me a ride with you! <cf>You can all take care of the engine!
You want to get out of Bernhardt's sea blockade? <cf>Who else but me can turn the engines?
As you can see, ship engines can only be handled by <cf>experts.
You may have picked up something you didn't expect. <cf>All right, keep up the good work and gather the rest of the crew.
You may have picked up something you didn't expect.
Well, now that we've gathered enough, let's get back to Jake's. <cf>Let's get back to Jake's.
Oh, ......, you're killing me!
I can't believe they even stopped the regular boat service. ...... <cf>I hope my moms are ok.
Are you not a sailor? <cf>You seem very discouraged.
Maybe it's the mouth that has lost <cf>jobs because the liner stopped?
Yeah, yeah. <cf>I'm having a hard time not having a job.
I have a family home in Bernhardt. <cf>My mom and sister live over there.
My mom is old and my sister is frail. <cf>So every time I went to work, I'd check on her.
I can't do that anymore. <cf>I don't know what's going on in the Principality, and I'm worried anyway. ......
Hmmm... ....... Let me ask you a question. <cf>What would you do if Bernhardt offered you a boat?
I would appreciate it if you could help me with the boat work. <cf>And while you're at it, you might want to pay a visit to your parents' house.
What?　Are you serious? <cf>That means you're a ...... stowaway, right?
Well, it's hard to say out loud. <cf>We have some business to attend to with Bernhardt.
If you keep waiting, you never know when you'll be able to go to <cf>
That's right. ....... <cf>It sucks that I won't get to see my family at this point.
I'm not sure what to do. ...... Okay, I'll take you up on your offer. <cf>Can you take me on the boat too?
I'm still worried about my family and how important they are. <cf>I will go to see them even if it is a dangerous bridge!
That's the spirit. Rest assured. <cf>I will make sure that you will not be blamed.
Hope you find your family safe and sound.
Now let's find the rest of the crew!
Hmmm... It would be easier to get over there if we had someone who knows the Kanaloa area <cf>
...... What?　Go to Kanaloa: ......?
Well, wait!　Wait! <cf>Is that true?　You guys are taking the boat out!
Hmmm. It would be great if a local could give us directions.
Leave it to me!　I'll show you around as much as I can! <cf>I'll do whatever it takes to get back home!
Oh, God of Bapharia!　I thank you! <cf>We are finally free of this dead end!
I don't know what it is, but it seems to have helped people. <cf>Well, that's good. Let's keep it up and get some sailors.
I don't know what it is, but it seems to have helped people.
The boat is ready. How's it going over there?
Ready to go to the Duchy of Bernhardt?
ready, go!
Yeah, we're all set.
Yeah, I'm all set.
Okay, I'll go then!
a bit more
Wait a little longer.
Wait a little longer.
Copy that. Come on, come on, come on.
Now, let's set sail! <cf>Once you go out to sea, you can't go back so easily!
Don't worry! <cf>Don't worry!
Carvein, Einrain. Wait for me. <cf>I'll save you, I promise.
The opponents are the most powerful elite knights of <cf>who were once known as the "Shield of Bapharia". Are you ready for this?
Let's go, to the Principality of Bernhardt!
Come on!　Get in!
Ggh!
Carvein！
Kuku......
I'm innocent and so is Einrain.
I did not assassinate His Majesty Norbert. <cf>Please believe me!
......[your] own origin, you should hate where you come from.
Your executions will coincide with the state funeral of the Duke.
I am sorry, but this is also my duty.
Knight Commander!　Master Hugo!
How about at least Einrain [--]!
(frustrated) Damn ............!
......Carvein
Don't tell me you're only helping me ......
I'm sorry, I ...... <cf>even swore to York that I would protect you. ......
Mr. Dunkirk ...... why ......
Now, starting today, you are a member of <cf>the Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt!
You will be a good knight. <cf>Together with York, you will be a cornerstone of the Duchy.
I'm counting on you, my sons.
York ...... what should I do ......?
The Duchy of Bernhardt extends from east to west across the capital <cf>. And that is the West Bernhardt Peninsula.
It is close to the capital and can be accessed from the sea, right? <cf>Dragon tribes have been coming here since ancient times and there have been wars.
It is, so to speak, an ancient battlefield that has marked the history of battles in the principality. <cf>Our step may be small, but it is a great step in history[--].
Hey! We're about to arrive. <cf>Let's get to the boat.
(Looking toward the land) Oh~!
You've arrived safely. <cf>I'm not sure how a hodgepodge of sailors could manage that.
Oh!　That!
(Noticing)
Execution to coincide with the state funeral of the Duke ......? <cf>Sounds like a real example to me.
We have to help them quickly!　Let's go to Bernhardt Castle!
What are you going to do? You're up against the valiant and audible <cf>Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt!
Fortunately, there are still days left before the state funeral. <cf>Let's first assess the situation and come up with a plan.
We will split up and gather information. <cf>Then we will meet at the entrance to the town. Are we clear?
Still, a public execution isn't exactly peaceful.
My husband says it's the public's duty to watch <cf>but that's just an onlooker.
Huh?　How do I get to the castle?
What do you want in the castle?　 <cf>If you're looking for an execution, why don't you go to the town square?
You shouldn't go out there for no reason at a time like this. <cf>You'll get caught because of suspicion.
...... Want to get into Bernhardt Castle?
Are you guys adventurers or ......
Then you can't. <cf>I'm told they're restricting the comings and goings now. ......
Well, if you want to include ......, it would only be a merchant with special permission from <cf>. ......
...... Well, there was a peddler I didn't see at the pier.
Huh. ...... <cf>Oh dear. ......
What's going on? <cf>I got cut off from my deal with ...... castle.
What, ......?　 <cf>Yeah, I won't be going to the castle for a while: ......
Why do you ask ......?
...... You guys are in some kind of trouble, aren't you? <cf> I'm telling you, it's better for yourselves if you don't think about anything strange right now.
I'll pretend I didn't hear it too. <cf>See ya.
(No choice, let's try ...... and see what else we can find: ......)
(Surprise)?
You can change the future.
Hey, servant!　Oh my God!
Help Carvein and Einlein. <cf>Please, please help those two ......
Is that ...... now?
What's wrong?　Just spaced out. What's wrong?
Oh, well. I'll take care of this first. Here.
I couldn't believe my eyes either. <cf>...... has the route of entry into Bernhardt Castle written all over it.
The sender is the owner of the coin-operated pavilion. <cf>An adventurer brought it to me a while ago.
...... Who is your husband? <cf>What on earth is he doing without telling me?
Anyway, there is no way we can let this information slip away. <cf>Let's all meet up and have a strategy meeting!
We'll meet up with Jake and Charlotte and go to <cf>and see what the letter says.
...... to get into Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway <cf>use the closed "Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway"
But to get in, you need a "key", <cf>which is hidden in the "Alston Abandoned Mine", ...... and
Yes, that is correct. <cf>Assuming the contents of the letter are correct.
There doesn't seem to be any other way. <cf>I guess we'll just have to trust your dad here, won't we?
The problem is that the soldiers can't find us. <cf>People in town say they've been patrolling a lot more often.
Well, they are actually here as stowaways. <cf>If he is found, it will be difficult to settle the matter peacefully.
I'm prepared for a little recklessness, but a commotion is not good. <cf>Let's try to sneak up on them and move forward as stealthily as possible.
Now then, everyone, our goal is the "Alston Abandoned Mine"!
Stop! <cf>Are you adventurers?　Where did you come from?
Let me check your identity. <cf>Remove anything you have or wear.
(There are only two of them. I'll get them to open up, and you and Jake can knock them out. <cf>)
(Surprise!
The dragon tribe!　Are you serious at a time like this?
Identification?　What kind of trouble is that?
This is why people are ......
Re ...... Mr. Leanbluhm! <cf>But in order to maintain security in the current situation [--].
No talking back. <cf>Just punish all suspicious people. ......
I will authorize it on behalf of Dunkirk. <cf>Go ahead. All of them.
[--] Kill them all.
...... We are proud Knights of the Duchy of Bernhardt. <cf>We cannot take a life without a good reason.
Hohoho?　I see, that's an admirable mindset!
[--]But the pride of the lowly is no food for livestock. <cf>It's a pain in the ass.
Die, all of you!
(Brace yourself for the wind pressure and be alert)!
Oh, shit!　Run!
Did he escape or ......?　Or is he dead?
I would have enjoyed it a little more if he had begged for his life in an ugly way.
...... I never thought that a dragon tribe would be found in such a place!
And to even mention Dunkirk's name.
It was kind of like the Knights were more <cf>beholden to that dragon tribe.
Yes, I know!　We need to help those people ......!
Stop, Miss Charlotte. <cf>It's poison he's spitting.
Those two are ...... already dead.
......The key is just down the road. <cf>We can't get poisoned here. Let's get a move on.
(nodding) Yeah.
According to the letter, <cf>the "Alston Abandoned Mine" can be accessed through this star vein hole.
OK! So there's a key in the back of it.
It's just a plain old mining site.
If you want to hide something, <cf>places like this are Better sa
I see. Let's go!
The key should be in the back there! <cf>First, get rid of anything that gets in the way!
The key is safe and sound. <cf>Now it's time to enter the castle through the underground canal.
...... I have one idea. <cf>Let's split up from here, diversion and rescue.
The Knights of Bernhardt are quite vigilant. <cf>There must be tighter security inside the castle.
If we all go in at this point, we might get <cf>all over the place. We don't want that.
I see. So you need a <cf>diversion to get the attention of the soldiers.
The diversion will be handled by me and Mr. Jake. <cf>You two help Carvein and Einlein out.
I can do better than to run around on the run. Besides, ...... <cf>I don't think Mr. Jake is cut out for covert action.
My overflowing top of the line aura is <cf>hard to hide!　I hate myself for attracting attention!
It made a lot of sense to me. <cf>Charlotte may have a talent for making a difference.
I believe in you guys. <cf>Please. Make sure you save us both.
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, I got it.
All right, then, we'll head for the underground canal.
See you in Kanaloa when all is said and done. <cf>Promise!
We are heading for the underground canal mentioned in the letter. <cf>It is said to lead into Bernhardt's castle.
You have the keys, right?　Then let's get going.
It seems to have been neglected for a long time. <cf>One would never know that such a place exists.
...... There's something in the back. Be on your guard.
If the letter is correct, there should be a prison ahead. <cf>Kick them to the curb, my servant!
Prison is just up ahead. Let's go.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Eh~!
(Laughs in a burikko ver.) Heh heh heh.
Wait a minute!　From where: ......
(smirks) Hmmm.
(Noticing - falling over) Hmm? ...... Wow!
There it is. The key to the jail.
Let's get you two out of here as soon as possible.
！？
Hold on, I'll open it now.
I never thought he would come to my rescue. ...... <cf>I'll forever be mad at my mentor.
You're an exaggerator.
Well, the gratuity should be a feeling. <cf>In proportion to the size of the feeling.
Speaking of which, what happened to York? <cf>He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would abandon you guys. ......
(Amazing) ......
Do you know York?
(Surprise.) Oh?
(Surprise) What?
I know you, you met her at the same place. <cf>You know, when you borrowed the pendant from Charlotte [--].
......York was not there at that time. He shouldn't be there.
(Question) Hmm?
Because ...... York is ......
York died ......2 months ago.
So, <cf>I shouldn't have met the masters then ......
...... dead?
The knighthood has been hit by avaritia and the knighthood is ......
...... Is this part of the history change? ......
...... is this part of the history alteration ......
There's a boat leaving for Kanaloa on the West Bernhardt Peninsula. <cf>Would you like to take it?
Would you like to go to "West Bernhardt Peninsula"?
There's a boat leaving for Asterleeds. <cf>Would you like to take it?
Would you like to go to "Commercial Town Asterleeds"?
I have a lot of questions, but first we have to get out of here. <cf>If anyone finds you, you're finished.
Wait. But first, let me talk to ...... the Knight Commander and <cf>Mr. Dunkirk.
What are you talking about? <cf>Of course you will be caught if you do such a thing!
You and Einrain will be executed in time for the state funeral. <cf>Can't you see that lives are at stake?
Running away from this will not solve anything. <cf>It will only lead to more needless strife.
I'll talk to Lord Dunkirk and clear me and Einlein of the <cf>suspicion of assassinating the Duke. That's the only way.
That man also called me 'son'. <cf>[--]Now that York is gone, I am the only one who can stop my father.
I too would like to know what ...... Dunkirk is thinking!
Let's go. Let's go to Dunkirk.
What are we going to do if we go alone? <cf>We'll take Carvein and Einlein with us.
Master. Sorry for being so selfish. <cf>Now, let's go to Master Dunkirk.
To get to the Oval Office, you have to go through the courtyard. <cf>You'll be more visible to the public, so be careful.
(During Jake's diversionary tactics) Get that guy!　Whoa!
Intruders are moving north along the city walls!
(During Jake's diversionary tactics) Don't let him get away, oh no!
(During Jake's diversionary tactics) Don't lose them, find them!　Aah!
(During Jake's diversionary tactics) That's him, get after him!　Ahh!
The cultists!　Turn the troops around!
(During Jake's diversion) Damn, where'd he go?
(Jake's diversionary tactics are underway.) Reinforcements are still on the way.
This place is good!　Let's go!
Huh, looks like Jake and his team's diversionary tactics are working <cf> 
Master, the Oval Office is not this way! <cf>Let's hurry.
(Surprise) Oh.
Despite being a major sinner.
Where do you think you're going?
Deputy Commander: ......
Let me speak with Master Dunkirk.
No, we have to talk!
I see. Then you can go to ......
(Surprise) Ha!
I will cut you down here.
Deputy Commander ......!
You who cooperate with Carvein are just as guilty. <cf>Those who cast a shadow over the coming Dunkirk-sama are
I, his right hand man, will eliminate all of them!
Damn. ......!
Excuse me, Deputy Commander. <cf>I really need to talk to Master Dunkirk.
...... eyes that never strayed, eyes that were straight. <cf>Your eyes, Master Dunkirk liked them.
The tremendous heartbreak brought about by the death of Master York was also healed, <cf>even if only a little, by your existence. ......
I could have wished for it, but I didn't get it. ......
You, of all people, that you ......
Why [--]!
Deputy Commander!
Don't touch!
Don't [touch] me ...... <cf>with your abominable bleeding hands!
That blood killed Master York. <cf>That blood.
I drove Master Dunkirk mad.
Deputy Commander ...... what in the world ......
(Receives thrown key). ......!
Key ......?
...... If you want to know, go underground. <cf>Drava Royal Research Institute. Master Dunkirk is there.
In that place, the root of all evil, I have seen the depth of [my] own sinfulness.
I'd like to know.
(Rushes to Veronica, who collapses)! ............, ah!
Don't worry. You just fainted.
(Relief) Huh.
The ...... blood ...... that flows through me?　And sin......?
[Let's go, let's go to Master Dunkirk's place.
Lend me your strength, Master.
What's up?　Einrain.
Oh, ....... <cf>Nah, it's nothing.
Why is the Lord of Dunkirk at the "Drava Royal Research Institute" ......? <cf>Why in the world would he go to that place ......
This is a research facility of the Order of Bapharia. <cf>They were working with the Order on weapons development and other projects.
Is there something behind this that we don't know about ......?
(Called for): ......
...... I see that you have a skilled collaborator.
You're lucky to be alive at all.
Dear Dunkirk, me and Einlein did not <cf>kill His Majesty!
Yeah, I know.
You're not the guy to do that.
But it has to be so. You and the oracle priestess will <cf>continue to die as assassins of the lord king.
Mr. Dunkirk ......?
At least you can follow me here.
Whose [--].
(Shock)!
(grunts) Uh-uh.
...... Do you know who this is?　Carvein.
(grunts) ugh ...... ugh
(surprise) ah ......
(Grunts) Aaaaahhhh ......
Hey, what's going on!　This is no time to freeze up!
(grunts) aaaa......aaaah!
Einrain......
No way. ......
(grunts) Ugh. ......
......York？
Na [--].
(grunts) aaaa......uuuuu
...... York was killed by Avaritia. <cf>That's what I told you guys, right?
Yeah, that's right. I have only one family [--].
I killed him with my own hands, <cf>not knowing that [your][sama][ra][sama][ra][sama][ra] made him avaritia!
(grunts) uaaaaaaaaa......
(Grunts) Uh-uh.
(grunts) Aaaaah!
Oh no!
(stunned) is ......!
This is the very regret I feel for having my son in my hands. <cf>Know that despair firsthand!
Get ready, Carvein!　Protect Einlein!
Get ready, Carvein!　Protect Einlein!
(grunts) "Aaaaah!
(posture) can be found at ......!
(grunts) "Aaah, aaah, aaah!
(Damaged and wobbly - kneeling) Ugh ......ts!
...... helping you at those ruins led to this defeat <cf>or ......
If I could do it over again, I would have killed ...... that time.
(Proceeding to Dunkirk) ......
Please tell us about ......
The deputy commander said that the abominable blood that flows through me <cf>drove you crazy.
And you said we <cf>made York an avaritia.
I'm ...... what in the world?
...... Do you still have the sword that was a memento of your mother's?
(takes out dagger) ......
What is this ......?
If it weren't for that, <cf>I wouldn't hate you ......
(Tackles Carvein.) --Ugh!
Gooooo!
(Sent to Dunkirk) Gah ......!　Ugh............
(Standing while picking up the dagger) Hah ...... Fu ......
No more ......
Don't let them dance in God's hands!
(Stabbing knife into neck) ¨......--!
(gasps) Ha! ......!
Dan ......
(dismay) Oh, oh ...... oh ......
York......
Oh, oh ......
Ohhhhhhhhhh ！！！！！
(Crying ear to ear) Ah haaaan ......!
Let's take ...... them both outside. <cf>Everything here is ...... stagnant......
(dismay) ah...... ah...... ah...... ah...... ah......
It was ......2 months ago. Lord Dunkirk was ordered by His Majesty to <cf>defeat Avaritia, who appeared in the basement of the castle.
A monster of a strange shape that I had never seen before. <cf>When he heard its demise, [--] Master Dunkirk knew.
The fact that the person he had taken into his own hands was the avaricious <cf>Master York.
York is ...... why ......
You ask that?　Priestess of the oracle
The source of the problem is the Bapharia cult.
(Surprise!)!
[--]Well, Bernhardt parish did it on their own. <cf>No wonder the priestess in charge doesn't know about it.
They have joined forces with the Duchy of Bernhardt to create <cf>a "pseudo-avaritia" that is easy to work with.
More engrams, more efficiently, to <cf>the divine tribe of Bapharia.
Wait a minute! <cf>There is no such thing as a Bapharia God Tribe, it's a fairy tale: ......
They're real. <cf>They come down to earth every once in a while and do bad things.
(confused)!
However, the pseudo-avaritia project had stalled. <cf> Until "that thing" appeared in the [Sanctuary of Blessings][--][Sanctuary of Blessings].
Avaritia Shell or ......!
If you combine that thing's body tissue with a human being, you get ....... <cf>You've seen how that turned out, right?
......It was funny. <cf>Dunkirk's face when he found out everything.
The man who was [sung] to be the best knight of his time, <cf>cries without being seen, you know?
No, it was already awesome. Once he learned the truth, he went straight for it. <cf>He had us attack the duchy and assassinate the king amidst the commotion.
Every single person involved in the plan was hanged.
Naturally, the Bapharia cult took the brunt of it.
But there's no way to <cf>touch the heavenly beings who were the source of the problem, no matter how hard you try.
The hatred that has nowhere else to go will only grow. <cf>[That's why I told you.
The sword you are holding belongs to the tribe of the god Bapharia.
(Stunned) Hah ......
Yes, your mother is a Bapharia goddess.
I guess the moment when the last remaining reason shatters is <cf>that's what I'd call it.
After all, the man I loved like a son is <cf>the child of the hateful, hateful Bapharia gods, right?
My real son is dead because of them. ...... <cf>Oh, funny ...... Kuh, hmmm ...... hahahahahaha!
...... Who are you?
...... Who you are
I like the way this woman looks. <cf>She doesn't seem to fit in yet.
I like the look of this woman, though. <cf>She still doesn't seem to fit in.
(Braces himself for the wind pressure.) Damn!
(Braces himself for wind pressure.) Whoa. ...... kukku!
(Surprised by wind pressure) Ah!
Dragon Tribe......! <cf>What does that mean?
You, what have you done with the Deputy Commander!
I ate it. <cf>earlier, when I was sleeping on the patio.
Gabri!　and ......, right?
(turns away, behind Carvein) Ah!
And the way he looks.
And memory.
flesh and blood
It's all mine!
(Laughing maniacally) hahaha!
(laughing maniacally) hahaha
You!
(Accepts spear - shockwave - gets blown away) <cf>っ...... woops......クッ
I can't believe I'm falling behind these people. <cf>Voldigen has fallen behind.
It's been a long time since I've had a chance to play. You can thank Dunkirk for that.
Oh, you can't take it anymore?　Excuse me. Excuse me.
(Laughs and flies away) Ha ha ha ha ha!
Wait[----]ッ!
(chagrined) ......
Let's go to ...... courtyard. I have to see if Veronica, <cf>that dragon tribe, is who she says she is. ......
(Notice) Oh, ...... Oh!
（Oh, ............!
Oh?　That's ......
King Norbert the Duke!
(Look at Carvein)!
Your Majesty!　Are you safe?
you (when referring to one's equals or inferiors)
(Surprise.) Oh!
Coin-operated pavilion husband ......? <cr>
Why here ......
(Carvein is pressured.) Wow. ...... Oh!
What are you talking about? <cf>This one is.
Duke of Bernhardt <cf>Your Majesty, His Majesty Norbert, the Duke of Bernhardt!
No, Feste's not wrong.
I am the owner of the Two-faced Coin Pavilion [--].
He was also the Duke of Bernhardt.
(Pause.) Oh, ......
No, no, no, don't be silly. I've never pretended to do so until now. ...... <cr>
Besides, wasn't the Prince supposed to have been assassinated?
There's a lot going on, even with this.
There's a lot you can't talk about either ......
(In a secretive manner) Mm-hmm.
I've heard all about the process so far from the secret service. <cf>We also just confirmed Veronica's death.
Thanks to you and others, we were able to prevent the rebellion of the Dunkirk faction <cf>. I thank you.
Oh, please wait!　It is not treason! <cr>
The Knight Commander was experimented on York [--].
Even though some of them are out of control, what would the people of <cf>think if they knew what the Order has done?
(Stuck for words) Ah...
Bernhardt Parish was acting on its own <cf>without following the wishes of the Order!
This led to misunderstandings and an unfortunate back-and-forth between the Order and the Duchy <cf>
I thank you, Prince Norbert, for your understanding in this matter. <cf>Our relationship is already a good one.
Knight Commander Dunkirk is deranged by the unexpected death of his son
He plotted to usurp the throne. This is what I'm going to drop this time.
(Swallows his words in frustration) ............
...... Someday, history will reveal the truth. <cf>Until then, you remember Dunkirk.
...... gyoi
Let's go to York's tomb after ...... <cr>
Master Dunkirk will be there: ......
We will take you to the [Sanctuary of Blessings] <cf>
Your bill is now paid. <cf>Leave the pavilion, stay here, or do as you please.
...... Oh, I'll do what I want!
Ha ha ......
(Smiles) Huh.
Well, let's get back to Kanaloa for now.
Jake and the others will be waiting for you.
Good job!
I'm glad everyone is safe and sound. ......
Hey, listen up. While you guys were gone, <cf>Big News popped in!
Actually, was the Prince King alive or something?
And that Carvein, the assassin, was <cf>the hero who prevented the Dunkirk rebellion?
What the hell, you know?
What a fool. You were in the castle just now, remember?
It's like we created the Big News.
Wow! I knew it!　Wow! I knew it! <cf>You are the Hero that saved this country.
By the way, where are you two?
Carvein is at the castle preparing for the ceremony. <cf>After all, he is the hero who saved the country.
(Mildly questioning Feste's appearance) ......?
Einlein returned to the Order. <cf>He wanted to see you, too.
Yes, thank goodness: ......
......Somehow you've suddenly become a distant person: ......
Sorry it's too late. I'll return this ......
Sorry it's too late. I'll return this ......
Ah ...... pendant ......!
It really helped me. Thank you.
You really helped me out. Thank you.
Yeah ...... I still feel at home with this.
Let's go back to Asterleeds. <cf>This time, we can go back with our heads held high!
You are Carvein, the hero who prevented the recent rebellion. <cf>For your loyalty to your principality, I bestow upon you a reward.
It was made especially for you. <cf>Pass it on to your children and grandchildren, and make it an eternal honor.
Ha!　Grateful happiness!
(Notice) A. ......
I've seen this ...... somewhere ......
Well, that's it for me. <cf>This has been the most thrilling adventure I've had in a long time.
I'm here too. <cf>I'm totally indebted to you.
Honestly, you've been a big help. Jake. <cf>Even you can be useful.
I know I said the ...... reward is good, but you've been paying for it. <cf>Let's see if we can get the old man at the coin pavilion to collect.
About that, that ......
My husband asked me to keep an eye on him. <cf>It looks like he won't be back for a while.
Geez, seriously? <cf>I mean, when did you meet my dad?
I'll be in Kanaloa for a bit. <cf>And while you're at it. Charlotte can stay with us for a while.
Oh, well, if that's what your father wants me to do, I guess I'll have to do it. <cf>I'll take care of your absence a little longer.
......Wouldn't it be nice to have a place to go home to?
Well, we're off to the temple for now. <cf>Einrain and the others should already be on their way.
Welcome back. <cf>Glad to hear you are safe.
Dunkirk died at ......, didn't he?
Maybe that's why the future looks a little different. <cf>It's turning around as a result.
Apparently, Mr. Dunkirk was one of the keys to <cf>avoiding future destruction!
Dunkirk is the future of ......?
Mm ....... <cf>Now, let's go to [Sanctuary of Blessings]!
Fuu...... seems to have calmed down
(faintly responding to Aerinse's call) Oh ......
[--]!　Look at that!
What?
(faintly moving) can be found at ......
(Surprise!) Ah!
...... destination, tai ......
Did you speak ......?
(very impressed) can be found at ......!
Tyris has spoken!　She's talking!
My consciousness started to separate from the avaritia shell!
Now we can find a way to help Tyris out. ......
(Laughs with delight) Ha ha ha ha!
(Tears of relief) Ha!
(Smiles) Huh.
Wait and be sure to visit ......!
Wait and be sure to visit ......!
Einrain has rewired and <cf>Tyris and Avaritia Shell are now stable!
But that still doesn't solve the fundamental problem. <cf>Until we isolate Tyris, we will not feel safe.
Whatever the method, we must save Tyris. ......
Oh?　Is this from ...... Bachelard?
&lt;The movements of Voldigen, the Dragon King.
&lt;There is no sign of Voldigen activity in our observation area at <cf>so far.
&lt;But there was a change in the future situation. <cf>It could be the result of your actions over there.
&lt;As a result, the activities of Voldigen and other dragon tribes may <cf>become more active. Please be careful.
&lt;It is not surprising that Voldigen in particular would have some <cf>connection to Avalitia Shell.
Voldigen and Avaritia Shell ......? <cf>Did you find any connection anywhere?
&lt;In the first place, Voldigen was <cf>the first subject of the Avalitya shell project.
&lt;In the initial stages, we were going to use his person as a prime body to make up <cf>avaritia shell.
&lt;He was disposed of as waste because he did not conform. <cf>In the process, he rebelled against the Gods and escaped.
What a ....... So, if all went according to plan, Voldigen would have been <cf>avaritia shell.
It's going to cause even more trouble. ...... <cf>What a shitty plan!
＜Voldigen is currently attempting to incorporate the conformist <cf>Aerinse-sama.
&lt;I assume that by doing so, they intend to merge themselves with the avaritia shell <cf>
&lt;I think he will eventually bring the beasts of <cf>[planet] under his control through the shell.
＜Voldigen is also a factor in the future of destruction. <cf>Be vigilant. That is all.
Aerinse. You know the story around here: <cf>Did you know that too?
That Voldigen was a subject. <cf>So I think the resentment of the dragon tribe against the god tribe runs deep.
I've been in hiding for a while now. ...... <cf>We'll have to watch out for Voldigen.
Well, as long as the shell is in the "Sanctuary of Blessings, <cf>I don't think the dragons will be able to touch it.
You can enter Bernhardt Castle here.
Would you like to go "Inside Bernhardt Castle"?
You can go out of Bernhardt Castle from here.
Would you like to go to "West Bernhardt Peninsula - Castle Shadows"?
Thanks to you, <cf>relations between the Order and the Principality have been restored!
Both Master Einrain and the [Sanctuary of Blessings] are safe.
On behalf of the Order, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you.
Is there any change in the situation of the "envoys"?
I have been told that nothing has changed, but if you have any concerns, please come to <cf>and we will be happy to help you.
Mm, I'll let you do that.
Thanks to Ms. Einrain, <cf>you are calm.
Hmmm.... A lot has happened, but it's great that Tyris has regained some <cf>consciousness.
But how to get there from here: ......
About that: ......
How about doing a chronoleap and going back to before Tyris was fused, <cf>?
(puzzled) Ugh! ...... ugh ...... mu
I believe it was Bachelard who said. <cf>He had already practiced it, but everything he did failed.
Yes, but there's something he hasn't tried yet. <cf>But there is one way he hasn't tried yet.
Go back before Bachelard takes me and <cf>destroys the Chronogate!
(confused). ...... ah
（What are you talking about? <cf>If you do that...)
The source of this problem is Bachelard's attempted fusion of Watashi and <cf>avaritia shells!
In other words, if Bachelard had not been able to come to this time <cf>I would not have been taken away ......
Tyris will not fuse with the shell either ......?
Bachelard is only working on the premise of a fusion between us and Shell <cf>
That's why it didn't extend to the act of destroying the Chronogate <cf>. Isn't that what caused the failure?
But [--]
If you can't go back to the future, <cf>you'll [--] to Voldigen.
If you can't go back to the future, <cf>you can go to Voldigen [--].
(Smiling) Huh.
The only chronogate that is active in this era is <cf>"[Pillar of Divinity]".
Even if I were to be eaten, there's nothing even Voldigen can do if I can't go back to the future <cf>
...... you do not need to go back to your own time?
...... for the future of Tyris, and by extension, the future of the planet.
I am willing to be a part of this time.
Oh, a little before this time. <cf>I must be careful not to meet my past self.
I'll have to watch out for ...... then.
I'll have to watch out for ...... then.
No, only I can go back in time.
You don't have to come with us.
All right, I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
It is the Lord's duty to take care of his servants.
(Surprised and confused) ah......
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but <cf>do you have a chronogram to go back in time?
I know where we can find a place. <cf>Charlotte can help you.
Charlotte has a <cf>Chronogram!
Well, he has a pendant with a <cf>high-purity chronogram in it.
Now what?
(Sighs and smiles) Huh, ......!
...... Go with me to the past. <cf>Live with me in that time.
With you, I am not afraid of anything.
All right!　Let's change the past with our own hands!
(nodding) Hmm.
It is Carvein, isn't it? <cf>Why are you here, my lord?
I wanted to check with Charlotte about something. <cf>We were just now talking about it.
This is the pendant Carvein got from the Lord King and <cf>this is my pendant ......
...... hmm? <cf>I'm guessing it's the same one.
No, His Majesty said it was 'specially made'. <cf>It is inconceivable that there is an identical one.
But I've had this since I was a child ...... <cf>and that's exactly what I've had since the day I was picked up and ......
Excuse me, may I also have a look at <cf>?
...... They're both very nice pieces. <cf>Charlotte's is older, though.
Judging from the way it is made, it is probably one of a kind.
Well, you have different eyes, <cf>but there are two right in front of you, aren't there?
Did the craftsman imitate it, or something?
They are too similar for that. <cf>It's as if ......
......?　What's up?
No, it's nothing. <cf>It's not supposed to be that way. ......
Is it a coincidence? <cf>I feel like it's something that's stuck. ......
By the way, do you guys want me too?
Can you lend me the pendant again? <cf>We really need it now.
Can you lend me the pendant again? <cf>We really need it now.
Yeah, go ahead. <cf>It's a favor from the man who saved my life. As many times as you want.
Aerinse. <cf>Take a look at what's in the pendant.
I can't believe it. <cf>It's a really high purity chronogram. ......
I don't know, but it's a great thing. It ...
Yes, ......! <cf>Thank you, Charlotte!
Now, let's go to the [Pillar of Divinity]. <cf>We must not squander your kindness.
You can find out more at ....... I've noticed something I don't like.
We're going to go back in time and <cf>never come back, aren't we?
Then, this pendant ....... <cf>I think it's still borrowed and can't be returned?
You don't have to worry about that.
If we destroy the Chronogate, <cf>there will be no more chronoleaps!
This means that there will be no future for us here to borrow the <cf>pendant from Charlotte!
We will no longer jump back in time!
So, in the hands of the new future Charlotte, the <cf>pendant will remain unclaimed!
Unnnnnnnnnnnn....... <cf>Let's see, that one did this and that one did that. ......
And anyway, <cf>Charlotte's pendant will stay with her, right?
Yes, I can assure you of that. I can assure you of that.
Well then, good! <cf>You can't just leave it on loan, you know.
If it stays in Charlotte's hands, that's a relief. <cf>I'll be grateful to use it.
Looking up at [the Mihashira] like this, <cf>it's always time to say goodbye!
Are you sure? <cf>We can't go back in time to see the Tyris of the past.
We will never see each other again. ...... <cf>This will be your final farewell.
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't miss ......
But if it would help her. <cf>If it would not put her in this nightmarish situation [--].
For me, it is the greatest joy.
It's okay. In the past, I and Tyris could be together <cf>as usual.
...... Okay, I get it. Then I'll say no more.
Tyris ....... <cf>Another one of us, please!
Please wait a little bit. <cf>Because we can all laugh and travel together once again.
...... is fine. <cf>Time and space are stable.
The time to return was around the time we arrived in Salamzart. <cf>Before Tyris contacted Bachelard.
I'm going to ......
...... seems to have arrived safely and at the specified time!
So let's get on with it.
Servants, break them as much as you can.
Let's be thorough and complete. <cf>Be painstakingly thorough to the central part of the body where the self-repair function is ineffective!
That's right!　Gosh, just do it, <cf>with no regrets or regrets at all!
(Agreeing) hmmm ...... hmmm!
(Chuckles ~ posture) Hmmm, ......ッ!
(Surprised by the arrows) ¡°
(Surprised by the arrow) ¡°Ha!
Watch out!
(Surprise!) Ah--!
What the hell?
That was ...... <cf>that attacked Ms. Charlotte in Salamzart. ......
It's coming!
Why are these guys here ......?
...... "Alicia's Blessings"
The Chronogate!
(Surprise!)
Gee!
Oh, no!
Ugh!　Aaah!
(Landing) --!
(Rushes to the Chronogate) --- Whoa!
(Surprised and concerned) -- ¡°......!
Can't you do something about it!
(pounding on the wall) Damn!　--Ts!
No!　I can't stop now!
You can't change the future.
(surprise)!
Go back to the past as many times as you want. <cf>And so strangle yourselves.
Oh, but we can't go back, can we?
See a future of despair and die.
(surprise) ah......
The world after ......2000 years......?
No way, I was jumped to this era ......?　Why ......
Look at that!
(surprise) is--!
The Future of Doom. ......!
The world is being swallowed up by ...... ......
The Beast of ......[Planet (Star)] ......?
Wow!
Kya!
Geez!
Hurry back!
(Turns around) --!
You are [--]
This gate will be broken by the beast of [planet] Hoshi! <cf>So hurry!
We'll never come back from this era!
(Haha) Ha--!
(Runs in)!
You too, quickly!
It's okay. You can [--]
(surprise) Oh, ......!
(Relief) phew ......
(relief) c......
Did you come back and ...... come to ......?
Yeah, somehow. <cf>Now it'll be right after I jump past .......
So we're back to square one. ......
Huh ......, too many things are happening at once, <cf>, my head is a mess!
I am also a member of ....... <cf>I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation.
...... that armed man. <cf>You knew the activation word for Chronogate.
It is impossible. <cf>That was supposed to be known only to a limited number of people.
And even the future of perdition: ......
Future ......
That's ...... where this planet goes......
...... Truly, our civilization is dying.
That's why you're going to change that future, right?
That's why you're going to change that future, right?
...... Yes, that's right. Exactly.
That is why I am here.
(nodding) Hmm.
Okay, let's go back in time again! <cf>This time we must destroy the Chronogate!
Maybe we will be attacked again. <cf>Let's be cautious.
No, it's more like a convenience. <cf>Let's take him alive this time and make him tell us all about it.
(suspiciously) Oh, ......
(surprise) --!
Chronograms are available at ......
No matter how high purity chronograms are, <cf>there must have been a limit. ......
But then, I don't have any more chronoleaps at ......!
(shakes head) ......
...... There's no point in staying here. <cf>Let's go outside.
I'll have to return the pendant to Charlotte. <cf>It's a little hard to say that I lost the contents, but ......
Welcome back. <cf>Have you finished your business yet?
Sorry. My bad.
I'm sorry. I was careless.
There was an armed group that attacked you, wasn't there? <cf>We had a fight with them on the way to the .......
The pendant's contents are broken. ......
...... It's okay!　Don't worry about it. <cf>See, I didn't even know it was in there originally.
More importantly, I'm glad you guys are safe. <cf>That makes me happier.
Thanks ......
Huh ...... what can I do? <cf>I'd jump again, but without a chronogram: ......
I don't think I could ask Bachelard to do that.
We have no choice. <cf>We'll just have to find it somehow.
First, let's try the people closest to us.
......I was an orphan. <cf>He was holding this pendant when he found me.
So this is the only lead I have on my parents. <cf>I don't know anything else about them.
Was it the chronogram ......? <cf>I didn't even know that was in there.
Can you tell me what it's like sometime? <cf>Maybe you can tell me something about my parents.
The masters fought the armed group you know, right? <cf>...... They're still lurking around somewhere.
And it's not just Charlotte who attacked <cf>the masters. ......
I knew I should have exposed myself then at <cf>Salamzart!
Hey! What's up? <cf>You don't look so good.
It's almost time for the annual "Seirei Matsuri", right? <cf>Let's enjoy it once in a while!
It's a festival where people from all over the world gather. <cf>We're thinking of a special menu too.
Selling the name of "Two-Faced Coin Pavilion" <cf>is the perfect chance!
How do the Bapharia gods procure the <cf>chronograms?
The chronogram is refined from a large amount of engrams[--] <cf>especially those based on human thoughts!
To collect that engram, <cf>used to use the power of the Bapharia religion.
In my time, the power of the Order was reduced, so <cf>it was rare and precious.
Um, you mentioned earlier that Jake said "Star Spirit Festival" and <cf>!
Hmmm. It's about time. <cf>What about it?
Yes, the "Star Festival" is still going on here: ....... <cf>If so, we may be able to work something out!
The Star Festival is a Bapharia celebration, but <cf>its real purpose is something else!
It is to gather the thoughts of many people and create <cf>"offerings to God" ......
That offering is the chronogram!
Oh my!　So, the Chronogram is ...... in the Order! <cf>OK, let's go talk to Einrain as soon as possible!
Masters, are you going to see Einlein? <cf>Then I'll go with you.
If Carvein is going, so am I!
...... What are you going to do?　[Go to [Sanctuary of Blessings], <cf>you'll see Tyris no matter what!
...... No, I think it's a good opportunity. <cf>Let's talk to both of you about what's going on.
Right now, Mr. Einrain's safety is <cf>the stability of Tyris.
To protect her, <cf>there can never be too many collaborators!
Well, ...... I understand. <cf>If you say so, I have no objection.
It's getting worse: ......!
Carvein ...... a ......
Why here: ......
...... because I was worried about you.
(Smiles)!
(Runs out)!
What the hell happened?
...... I just had a sign of awakening in the [mitsuka]i.
I rewired it right away, so it's fine. <cf>I just use more power than before. ......
What is that? <cf>What is Einlein doing here ......
And that one ....... <cf>That guy, I believe, is ...... Mr. Tyris ......?
That is an avaritia shell. <cf>It is said to be a messenger of God.
It's a long story. ...... <cf>I think you guys should know about it.
(nodding)!
(Looking at Aerinse) Oh, ......
(Looking at Aerinse) Oh, ...... oh!
(Looking at Aerinse) ah ......
Please listen to ....... <cf>The journey through time that we have taken [--].
Future ...... Bapharia Divine Tribe ......
Chronoleap?　History changed? <cf>How can you change something that happened in the past? ......
God ......
It's not a questionable thing. <cf>[It's a ridiculous story.
I remember when I first lent ...... the pendant to <cf>
At that time, you were desperate. <cf>To cross time and rescue Mr. Aerinse.
It doesn't seem to me that what you just said is a lie. <cf>So [--] I believe you.
Master ......
(approached) ......!
If that hadn't come jumping in six months ago, ...... <cf>York would be ......
Let's do what we can now?
That would make York happy: ......
...... I guess so.
Yeah, I bet he would.
Well, let's see. Now that we know what's going on [--].
Let's find a way to help Mr. Tyris. <cf>Even Einlein is in trouble if we don't.
(Nodding) Yeah.
It was a great relief for me to be able to confide in you all at <cf>
Come on, this time to save Tyris. <cf>Let's go back to the past as soon as possible.
That's why you need offerings to God [--] <cf>chronograms.
That is why, Einrain. <cf>Do you have any offerings?
I'm sorry. I have no idea. ...... <cf>Lugerio keeps track of all that stuff.
Where is this Lugerio now?
I had a discussion with the chief priests today. ...... <cf>I think they should be back at the temple in Asterleeds by now.
Hmmm. Well, let's go back to the temple. <cf>It would be bad to stay here too long.
I'll be back. <cf>See you later, Einrain. See you later.
Take care of Mr. Tyris, Einrain. <cf>Can I come see you again, too?
Yeah, I want you to come back. I hope you'll come back. <cf>And Charlotte, take care at ......
Is it an offering: ......
If so, we offer them all to God after the Hoshinrei Festival is over.
The only thing I can give you now are these pieces.
(Shakes head left and right) ......
Very much, this is all you need to know: ......
You are going to hold the Seirei Matsuri again this year, aren't you? <cf>If possible, could you give me the offerings you will make at that time?
(Shakes head from side to side) n......
On that note, <cf>the decision was just made to cancel the Star Festival.
I can't get the "Star Spirit Diva" needed for the ritual.
Star Spirit Diva is not the star of the ...... Star Spirit Festival!
Three divas are needed to make the offering
However, two were killed during a raid by the principality. <cf>The remaining one had a wounded throat and returned to his homeland. ......
Yes, yes, yes!
I'm running for diva!
(Doubtfully) Hmm, hmm ......
I'm pretty confident in my singing. <cf>Do you want to hear it?　Do you want to hear it?　Okay, do you want to listen?
(Dumbfounded) n......
It's not that simple.
May I?　To be a diva [--].
(Exclamation) Oh!
(exclamation) Hoho~!
(exclamation) Wow, heh, heh.
(exclamation) Oh, ha ha!
How's it going?
Sure, you sound like quite the singer, but <cf>you need to be qualified to be a diva!
See. This offering [--]
You're responding to ......?
...... Maybe it's a pass?
...... Amazingly, <cf>you seem to qualify as a diva!
(Laughs) Wow!
Yes!　Well, then, one of us is set.
Wait a minute! <cf>You're being targeted by an armed group, okay?
If you do something so conspicuous as singing at the Seiryoku Festival, you will also [--].
You're saying I might get attacked? <cf>Of course, there is that risk, but ......
More importantly, you need a chronogram now, don't you?
Even Einlein is putting her body on the line. <cf>Then, I want to do what I can do, too.
And...and...and..!
A rising, up-and-coming traveling diva who is rapidly gaining popularity, <cf>What a great opportunity to market the brilliant Charlotte!
(Dumbfounded) ah......
(Duh.) Huh. ......
(Stunned) ahaha ......
(Duh.) Hmmm... ......
...... I have no choice. Please don't do anything rash.
Yeah!　No, I'm not!
At this rate, if we have enough divas, we could have a <cf>star festival.
(nodding, puzzled) Nope. ......
All right! <cf>Let's get two more, no matter what it takes!
I'm going to go with Charlotte for one of the divas: ...... <cf>and two more to go.
I heard that one of them went back to his hometown with a throat wound. <cf>Is there any way to bring him back?
I have been told that there is a medicine that works well for [SATO], but <cf>there is no news yet that he is getting better!
His name is Lalaforte. <cf>He is of the blood of the People of the Forest.
Actually, we've had a bit of a problem with the Order and the Forest People <cf>......
The Lalaforte homeland is off limits to <cf>anyone affiliated with the Order!
So is Lalaforte going it alone?
It will be. We'll have to wait for them to contact us at <cf>
If that's the case, it might be quicker to go over to <cf>to see what's going on.
If you are looking for Lalaforte, you may want to head to <cf>"Cape Rauwehara"
The forest people's [home] is in the [outer continent]. <cf>Cape Rauwehara is the gateway to it.
Please use this offering to identify the singing voice. <cf>It should glow the same way as Charlotte's.
Let's look for those with diva qualities here as well!
For our part, we would like to hold the Hoshireisai. <cf>It is an important ritual to honor the gods.
Though not as important as the oracle priestesses, <cf>the star-spirit divas are also an integral part of the Order!
Then let's get going! <cf>Cape Rauwehara should have a regular boat service from the harbor.
Wait a minute. You're going too!
Of course. She's the one who sings with me. <cf>I have to make sure with my own eyes!
I'll go with you. <cf>Because your escort isn't done yet.
I am sorry. I will stay here. <cf>I am concerned about the sudden deterioration of Tyris' condition. ......
Perhaps the incident at [Mihashira] may have affected <cf>......
Mm, yes. Let me know if you need anything else.
If you're looking for a boat to Cape Rauwehara, <cf>it's about to leave any minute now!
Come on, get in, get in!
It's finally here!　[The Outer Continent!
This is not like the Magna continent. <cf>It is only recently that the number of people has begun to increase.
There are still many untouched places in the backcountry. <cf>A new stage of adventure awaits us!
Hmm?　My servant, the Omnistron is responding. <cf>Have you received a message?
&lt;Aerinse. <cf>Have you arrived at Cape Rauwehara by now? &gt;
&lt;There has been no change in Tyris so far. <cf>&lt;Please be assured that there is no change in Tirith at this time.
&lt;We are, for the moment, at <cf>Bapharia Temple in Asterleeds.
&lt;I also heard from a member of the congregation about Mr. Lalaforte. <cf>I heard that she played an active role in the last Hoshinrei Festival.
Hmmm. It seems <cf>certain that Lalaforte is an experienced diva.
&lt;A valuable story comes with a price, doesn't it? <cf>So we have paid you some money.
&lt;1000000 Lunos or so, but <cf>they were very pleased with it.
Noooooo!
Wait a minute!　That's not the kind of big <cf>information you'd pay that much money for!
＜Bachelard gave me some money <cf>for something, and it came in handy.
＜I'm sure you'll be very happy to hear from us. <cf>We are looking forward to your return. Good bye.
No, no, no, no! <cf>Now that you mention it, I'm rather full of worry!
Aerinse's. <cf>You're not going to get very far with this kind of money!
I must quickly find Lalaforte and return home. <cf>As I recall, you said you were ["]of the blood of the people of the forest["].
...... hmm?　Hey, what's up with Carvein?
Huh?　You were there just a minute ago.
Next to wasting money, you're lost! <cf>Totally, all of them. ......
Servant, let's find Carvein first. <cf>Oh, my God, they are so tiresome!
Forest People or ......
Besides, this scenery ....... <cf>It looks somewhat familiar [--].
Holy shit, Carvein! <cf>Don't wander off by yourself!
......?　What's wrong?
No, it's nothing. <cf>I was just curious about the idea of forest people [--].
Nah [--]!　Oh, that one!
Never been to the Principality?　Then let me show you around.
There's a store that serves great tea. <cf>It has a nice interior and cute little things [--].
Mr. Hugo! <cf>What are you doing here, all alone?
......!
Oh my gosh, you got away with it. <cf>Because you come at me with a great swagger: ......
What, you know each other?
This is Hugo, the high civil official of Bernhardt. <cf>He is currently working beside the Duke of Bernhardt to restore the internal administration of the kingdom.
It was supposed to be ...... ......
What happened to your escort?　What are you doing here?
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that. <cf>I came here to do a job. It's an inspection.
I am currently planning to move from the principality to the outer continent. <cf>I have been gathering information about this area.
Now I was asking a lot of you from a woman's point of view. This can't go on with <cf>Moody Knight, can it?
From a woman, no ....... Then I would like to ask one question. <cf>There is a ...... called Lalaforte around here.
Oh, there's another beautiful lady over there! <cf>Excuse me, I'd like to ask you a few questions: ......
Dear Hugo! <cf>...... What's with that guy?
Is that Bernhardt's Higher Civil Service ......? <cf>Must be some kind of a mistake or something.
Despite appearances, Mr. Hugo is an excellent civil official. <cf>The politics of the Principality cannot be discussed without him.
I don't think so very much. ...... <cf>Anyway, let's hear about Lalaforte.
Hey, buddy. For what it's worth, you know a lot about <cf>women who live around here, don't you?
Of course not. Do you have any idea how much passion I have <cf>for you ladies?
There is nothing about women in this land that I <cf>do not know!
What are you bragging about ....... <cf>So, have you ever heard of a woman named Lalaforte?
He has the blood of the forest people. <cf>They must have stopped in this area.
Lalaforte ....... <cf>Oh, are you referring to the Star Spirit Diva?
I heard that you are living in a [hermitage] outside of the village <cf>
I hear she is quite an exotic beauty. <cf>Unfortunately, I have not had the pleasure of meeting her, but I am fascinated by her.
Oh, by the way, Carvein. <cf>You have a very beautiful woman with you.
Is she your girlfriend? <cf>Which is your true love, Lady Einrain or her?
Oh, no, it's not like that! <cf>She is my escort!
Hmmm. Yes, that's right. <cf>There's no target [de][shi][ka][o][o][o][o][o][o] for escorting.
Huh?　Huh?　Why are you mad at me!
So what is it really?
No, its ....... <cf>I'm looking for a diva to open the Star Festival.
Oy?　I've been told by the new head priest of the Bernhardt parish that this year's Star Festival will be cancelled. <cf>
Anything, because we don't have enough of those divas.
I'm going to be the diva!
...... you?
Yes, I am!　Come and listen if you like!
...... Oh, yeah, I see. <cf>Oh ...... no, that's good to know.
Now that I have the energy to do my job, I'm going back to my inspection.
I look forward to the Hoshirei Festival, beautiful diva!
...... was a bit of a tricky one, wasn't it? <cf>He is strangely knowledgeable or something. ......
Oh well. Lalaforte is at the nearby Iori. <cf>Let's go there and see if it is true.
Are you the diva Lalaforte?
We are Lugerio's messengers. <cf>We are gathering divas to hold the Star Festival.
Here, this offering is proof of that.
How's your throat?　Are you able to sing now? <cf>I heard there's some good medicine over here, but I'm not sure how it's going [--].
Put ...... in the [SATO] and get ....... <cf>Punishment for joining the cult is ...... banishment and ......
You seem to have trouble speaking. Take it easy.
I am Charlotte. I'm the new diva.
I really want to make the Seirei Festival a success. <cf>So I need you to teach me a lot.
I'll definitely get my throat fixed for that. <cf>Best regards, senpai!
Hey, do you have to be in <cf>[township(s)] to get the medicine you're talking about?
If you have "slime moss" ......, you can find it at ....... <cf>But it's hard ...... to pick it.
Pioneer Station ...... request ............ failed, I did ......
Don't worry about that. <cf>We are not ordinary adventurers, are we?
Where can I get one?
The Valley of the Coral Rocks, ......
Okay, I've undertaken it. <cf>Let's go pick them early!
This is it, isn't it?　This is the place Lalaforte was talking about.
...... is behind this one, right?
Don't worry, we're here for you!
Oh, that's ......!
Mwah! <cf>We're only one step away from the ingredients for the medicine!
I'll leave it to you! <cf>Master!　Let's go!
Okay, you got your "slime moss" <cf>but ......
Ugh ...... that's a terrible smell. <cf>Is this what it does to your throat......?
...... you want to give it a try?
My throat is in great shape right now!　I'll pass!
I wonder if ...... this will help me sing better. <cf>If so, I'll make it a souvenir of Einlein. ......
...... Carvein's head is always full of <cf>einlein.
Huh?　No, that's not true. <cf>It's just that Einlein said so [--].
Hmmm ....... <cf>I'm in my escort now. ......
(Master!　Did I say something bad?)
I see...I see...I see...I see...I see...I see... ...... <cf>It's good to be young. ......
Hey Carvein. By the way, <cf>what do you think of Lalaforte?　Especially the looks and stuff.
Hmm?　Yeah, I thought he was cute. ......
Heh, heh, heh, heh? <cf>Cute, huh?　Hmmm, yeah. Ah, yes.
I'm under escort and I have my eyes on another girl. <cf>You can afford it, can't you?
（Master!)
And anyway, let's get the stuff to Lalaforte. <cf>Here we go.
Yes, I know. I've got to get the ingredients to the lovely Lalaforte and get back to <cf>my beloved Einrain as soon as possible, don't I?
Oh, I was just following Master Dunkirk's words that 'women should always be attentive and complimentary' <cf>......
What did I do wrong? <cf>Tell me, York. Mr. Dunkirk. ......!
Available at ...... and ......!
Can we make drugs with this?
...... wait ...... and ......
N...... nn......!
(SINGING)
(surprise) Oh ......
(surprise) ah......
(surprise) ha ......!
Awesome ......
That's what I call a star spirit diva. ......
All!　Complete!　Restoration!　Revitalization!
(Surprise) What? ......
(Surprise) wooh...... ah
(Surprise) Oh, ...... ah!
(Surprise!) Wow.
Thanks to you guys, I'm cured!
The daily stress of not being able to speak!　Freedom from that! <cf>Now I have overwhelming freedom!
Congratulations, me. Thank you, God!
And I love everything!
(surprise) ah ...... ah
(Surprise) Oh ...... ah ......
Ki...... you were a very bright and cheerful person.
I'm glad you can talk. <cf>A smile suits you better than a sad face.
Oh no, such a straight compliment: ......
(Feeling their eyes on me) Hmm, hmm?
(With a jealous look) Uhhhh...
(They looked at me with a great face.) Yeah.
(Chuckles) Hee hee hee.
Whatever the case, I'm glad your throat is healed. <cf>Will you be able to attend the Seirei Festival?
Of course!　I am Lalaforte, the diva of everyone. <cf>With this voice, I will make you my prisoner... ♪
Hey, ...... that's my signature line! <cf>I'm wearing it!　Change it to something else!
Oh dear, I am the senior, aren't I? <cf>Then, juniors should follow seniors... ♪
(Upset)!
Phew, now let's go say hello to Master Einrain. <cf>She needs to see me in good health!
Oh, Mr. Lalaforte! <cf>I'm so glad you're all right.
I am back. <cf>Is Mr. Einrain in the Ritual Room?
Yes. He is appeasing the "Mikitsukai" (the messenger).
Lalaforte also knows about <cf>
Yes, I was surprised when I saw it for the first time. I was indeed surprised when I saw it for the first time. ......
If Master Einrain is here, you can rest assured. <cf>Now, let's go during the ceremony.
Diva Lalaforte. <cf>We have just returned!
Healed, thank goodness: ......
I am sorry for your concern on that occasion. With the blessing of the God of Bapharia <cf>we are able to return here again!
So the wrath of God's 'messenger' has been appeased.
Yeah, now I've managed to get ......
By the way, Mr. Einrain. <cf>Did you practice your singing properly?
Now that you have asked me for guidance, you can't be a lousy sidekick. <cf>Practice on 1, practice on 2. No 3, no 4, and boundaries on 5!
No, one has to be warded, right!
Yes, leave the outside world out of it. <cf>So, can you tell me a little bit about your results?
What, now ......?
this
Here ......?
WHEREAS.
(startled) ah......
(startled) Ugh ......
(Surprised) Oh, ...... ha ha ha!
(A little surprised) Well.
(surprised) Oh, ......
This song ...... can be like this ......
She's been like this for a long time. <cf>But she really likes to sing ......
Hey, Charlotte. <cf>As a diva, do you have any advice [--]?
(Surprise!) Ew!
(turns around) Hmm?
(turns around) Oh, ......?
(shedding tears) ha...... hah l...... ha......
What's the matter with you! <cf>You're so bad at this, you're in despair!
(Upset) Ugh, yeah ......, ugh ah ah ah ......
I don't know ...... but ......
I missed it so much. ......
My chest became ...... painful and ......
Did you miss ......?
(Noticing) Oh, ...... ah!
(Noticing) Ha!
Tears ......?
Don't tell me, did you just see a change in the song? <cf>If so, then ......
No change ...... or
Does it have anything to do with this song ......?
Anyway, I'm glad the <cf>situation has improved, if only by accident!
Tyris' consciousness is definitely emerging: ......
Just one more diva we need!
The third diva, but I can't find any clues.
Then ...... Lugerio is going to see him now. <cf>I've found someone who is qualified. ......
What?　Where is it?
Minsterhorn......
Minsterhorn. Well, let's get to it [--].
You can't... <cf>Charlotte is here to stay!
You will be on stage as the diva of the Star Spirit. <cf>You will learn the appropriate etiquette.
Eeeee!!! <cf>I'm not good at that kind of thing: ......
Whether you're not good at it or not, this is a Shinto ritual. <cf>And it's the biggest celebration of the Bapharia religion.
Relentless Bishi!　Bash!　I'm coming for you!
Ca, Carvein!　Einrain! <cf>Don't look at me, help me!
I'm your escort. If you want to keep yourself safe, it's best you stay here at <cf>
It's ok. Lalaforte is strict, but ...... <cf>really strict, but ...... basically, he's gentle.
I stressed that it's tough! <cf>Oh no, let me go!　I'm coming with you!
At ......, we'll go alone.
Oh?　You are ...... Millene, right?
(Noticing) Hmm!
Oh, and Feste, the very beautiful girl! <cf>And the adventurer who helped the teacher!
What if ......! <cf>You mean Millene was the diva candidate!
Apparently, that's what it looks like~.
Do the two of you know each other? <cf>If so, we can talk quickly!
(pressure sores) ah ......
How about it? <cf>Will you take on the matter of the Star Spirit Diva?
As you can see, you are a qualified diva!
Eh ...... and ......
I ask you to do the same! <cf>For some reason, I want to hold the Star Festival no matter what it takes.
I guess so. ....... <cf>Can I ask one thing in exchange then?
I found a strange 'metal plate' at the ruins the other day. <cf>Could you bring it to me?
Anyhow!　I want one, but I couldn't get my hands on one because of the <cf>monster.
The location is at the far end of the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins". <cf>It's a rather strange ruin that was recently discovered.
In my view [--].
Okay, I get it! <cf>We'll take care of that.
However, after viewing that metal plate or whatever it is, <cf>please deliver it to the Order once.
The relics are under the jurisdiction of the Order. <cf>If there are no problems with the relics, we will return them to you later.
Yay!　 <cf>If you can show me properly, that's all I need.
It's settled. Well then, my servant. <cf>Let's get this over with!
The "metal plate" is in the back here, isn't it? <cf>...... Oh, Millene is a very rough woman, isn't she?
Well, it shouldn't be too much trouble. <cf>I'll find you quickly and easily, my servant.
Millene said it was a strange site. <cf>I'm pretty sure this is where the "metal plate" is.
Kick them to the curb!　Servant!
Servant, you got the "metal plate" right!
Okay, I've got a third diva now!　Now we have our third diva.
Hmm?　Omnistron is reacting to something.
&lt;Aerinse. <cf>Where are you now? &gt;
&lt;There is no change in Tyris' condition. <cf>I even let her hear Ms. Lalaforte sing.
&lt;I wonder what in the world that girl is dreaming about <cf>......
＜I have just started "Arubaito" at Coin-tei!　I have just started <cf>"Aru Baito" at Coin Tei! ＞I've started "Arubaito" at Coin-tei!
＜After all, to live in this day and age, <cf>you need to be financially literate.
&lt;I think I will start by learning "Sararaai". <cf> Please check back later to see the results.
...... I'm surprised that you work at the Coin Pavilion. <cf>That Aerinse guy is so bold.
But, well, it's much more constructive to exercise <cf>than to wallow in depression.
It means he's grown up a little.
＜Oh, and I forgot to tell you something important <cf>
&lt;Lugerio and Millene have returned to the temple in Asterleeds <cf>
&lt;We'll be waiting for you two. <cf>Please leave as soon as possible. Good day to you.
[Why don't you tell me that first? <cf>This is much more important than a part-time job!
Oh, man. You almost had me looking all over <cf>for Millene.
Then let's go to the temple in Asterleeds. <cf>Let's deliver those metal plates to Millene.
Here, I got it. <cf>That's good, right?
This, this!　I wanted this metal plate. <cf>Thank you!
Well then, let's get on with the deciphering and decoding!
Hmmmmmmm ...... hmmm? <cf>Hohoho ...... eh!
This is ...... wow... Really! <cf>Hmmm ...... hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm!
Hey. Hey?
This is what this is ...... hmmm hmmm, oh!　Oh oh oh! <cf>Woohoo~ ...... eh?　What what what?　Mmmmmmmmmm......
No, I can't hear you at all. <cf>We'll just have to wait until it's over.
[--]Wow!
Listen to me for a second!　It's still as I proposed! <cf>This is not just a sentence, it's a song. Part of a song!
If you connect it with the relics we found earlier, it should make sense. <cf>This is a song passed down through the ages, more ancient than myth!
The fact that a single song has been passed down through the ages <cf>between completely different civilizations [--].
Well, wait. Wait a minute!　You're just like your master when you start talking <cf>and don't stop, aren't you!
Oh, ...... haha, I'm sorry. I just got excited.
Right. ......
(clears throat) Hmm.
(surprise) Ugh ......
(surprise) oooh ......
(Looking at Feste and the others)!
...... like this?
The song now is ......
Yes, that's what I taught Einrain. <cf>I didn't know there was more. ......
Eh!　You know that song now! <cf>Where!　How did you know it!
I didn't know any of these people when I started looking them up. ...... <cf>Please, tell me where you learned them!
Oh, no, I knew that ...... when I noticed it, or ......
......When I think of it, it's strange. <cf>I forgot everything, but I remembered this song: ......
It seems that my memory is as hazy as your own.
I'm sorry. <cf>I don't know much about this song.
Oh no. ......
Fumu ......
At any rate, the three of us are all here. <cf>Now we should be able to hold the Hoshinrei Festival!
Thank you for collecting the divas!
Thanks to all of you, we will be able to hold the Hoshinrei Festival!
However, this does not mean that the concern is gone!
So, I'd like to discuss this with you. <cf>I'd like to ask you all to continue to work with us.
We have been trying to find out more about the militia group that was being investigated here: <cf>As a result, we still don't have any more details.
...... has seen an increase in the number of strange faces in town since Charlotte started walking around with you <cf>
Originally, Asterleeds was a town with a lot of people coming and going. <cf>But ...... seems a little too intense!
If it's the Star Festival, there will be more and more people. <cf>Are you okay with that?
The area around the diva will be guarded <cf>by the best guards in the Order.
Mr. Carvein will also be cooperating.
The Duchy of Bernhardt will also be sending a knighthood to <cf>
With apologies for the earlier incident, he said.
If you two could also help with security <cf>would be appreciated.
Of course. Leave it to me.
Hopefully, the Hoshinreisai will go off without a hitch!
The Asterleeds Star Festival is now in session! <cf>Notify all the congregation!
Once we decided to open the event, preparations proceeded very quickly. <cf>I guess everyone was looking forward to it.
Well. We have a little time before the show starts. <cf>Let's have a little look around town.
Ahh ...... ah~!
(Hurriedly) Aaaaahhh, hah!
Plates are so easy to break. ......
Sure, it's easy to crack, but I don't think there are many <cf>who crack it in 100s of pieces, ze?　It's a talent of some kind. ......
Oh well. <cf>Husband, I will reimburse you for what this man has broken.
(What is it? (What is it? ) Hmm?
I am not a suspicious person. I just can't bear to see the beautiful one <cf>in trouble.
(Stinky) Oh? ...... Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
(Surprise!) Oh, ...... Oh!
No, it is not. It is not rude to ask a complete stranger to <cf>shoulder your failures ......
Oh, my God! <cf>You are beautiful not only in figure but also in mind!
This is fate. What do you think?　Let's have a quick cup of tea.
(In a pick-up way.) Huh?
(He holds my hand.) Oh, ......
I will be sorry if I never see people like you again at <cf>before the merciless passage of time, you know?
What ...... yeah ......?
Hey there!　You are Hugo, I think you said. <cf>What is a high civil official of the Duchy of Bernhardt doing here?
(Looking at Feste) Ah!
Well, well, well. It's been a long time since Cape Rauwehara. <cf>To all of you who have thwarted Dunkirk's ambitions.
You knew about this? <cf>And then you ignored us.
(chuckles) Hmm.
So what are you doing here?
I'm here as an emissary from the Principality to inspect the Star Festival. <cf>I would like to make peace with the Order.
I was thinking of lending you a dukedom soldier to take on some of the security duties. <cf>As a token of my apology, the cost will be ours.
The cost of lodging, food, and even souvenirs for the soldiers we bring in will fall on <cf>Asterleeds, and the economy will turn around!　The Order will be enriched!
I am a hard working man who is always thinking of everyone. <cf>So let's go have tea!
(impatiently) Oh, no. ......
Don't casually take our employees!
Carvein is also in Asterleeds, <cf>I can get him here.
(Disgusted) Tsudzu!
I don't like that uptight guy. <cf>He'll lecture me again.
No choice. Let's get back to work. ......
Ah, but there are cute priestesses in the cult, yes.
Well, I will leave you now. <cf>My beautiful one, I will see you again eventually: ......
It is time for the festival to begin. <cf>Let us return to the temple together.
Sorry, Jake. I'll leave you alone today: ......
Oh. Watch out for strange men.
(see off) hahaha
Ah!
Oh~ ......
By the way, Aerinse. You want to work part-time <cf>I don't mean to interrupt your will, but ......
That outfit is ...... umm ....... <cf>And you plan to go to the Temple with it?
Oh, yes. <cf>You shouldn't be in your work clothes.
It would be <cf>rude not to dress appropriately for the time and place.
Please wait a moment while I change my clothes.
Oh dear. I can only imagine what Tyris is going through.
I was busy, and it took a lot longer than I thought it would. <cf>Let's go back to the temple.
Great ......! <cf>The festival is about to begin in earnest!
Let's see what happens at ...... ......
...... don't worry. The Seirei Matsuri will be a success. <cf>I will make it succeed.
(Nodding) Hmm.
......, so this is the second song that I've been working on.
I think it's interesting, but what about in terms of seniority?
It's out of the Order's customary practice and <cf>should be stopped. ......
Rather than dozing off at an important ritual, <cf>it's good to bring a good stimulus... ♪
I heard some disturbing conversation, are you okay?
Don't worry. We'll <cf>work it out until the offerings are ready.
Yes, I'm counting on you. <cf>Just don't overdo it.
It's about time.
OK!　Okay, each of you do a final check <cf>and meet me backstage when you're ready!
Alright! <cf>I'll make you all swoon with my singing!
Charlotte, you are so full of life!
You've come to the right place. You can watch from the audience.
Oh, may I?
Leave the security to us and Carvein. <cf>You can enjoy the festival without worrying about it.
Now, let's check in with Lugerio one last time.
We thought it would be difficult this year, but <cf>this is how we can give a song to God!
This is all thanks to all of you. <cf>Thank you, God, for the encounters!
I hear that <cf>you all are looking for offerings to God.
The Star Spirit Diva also has a role to play in the creation of offerings
This Lalaforte, I will help you to the end. <cf>Please, may God bless you.
The more I check the lyrics and the choreography, <cf>the more anxious I get!
At times like this, it's better not to think too much and just go <cf>with a bang!
But still, I never thought I would be a star spirit diva! <cf>And I heard that Charlotte is with you.
I sometimes sing to earn money to fund my research, and I often get to know <cf>traveling entertainers.
Charlotte, she also taught me her signature song.
Yes, that's right!　I'll tell you the song on the metal plate from the other day, <cf>thanks!
Phew ...... now if we can drag <cf>Charlotte into the swamp of ancient history too ......
Oops, this is not the time for idle chatter. <cf>Come on, focus!　Focus!
♪ Aaaaaaaaaaaaah ♪
Alright!　I'm getting excited! <cf>I knew I like this kind of atmosphere.
Just like before I go on stage, I naturally feel empowered. <cf>I feel like I can do anything.
Of course, I haven't forgotten about the raid. <cf>But I'm not afraid of them now.
And I have you guys behind me. <cf>I have to do what I have to do.
I'm fine. If you want, you can give a shout out to everyone.
Let's make sure the Hoshirei Matsuri is a success. <cf>We won't let any strange people get in our way!
In the name of ["]......, we hereby announce the opening of the event. <cf>With the God of Bapharia, Einrain ["]"]
......A brilliant opening statement. <cf>As expected of Mr. Einrain.
However, once you have made your declaration, please return to the cathedral immediately at <cf>
I know. It's my duty.
Well, the preparations seem to be going well here.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is ....... <cf>All is well, I would say. ......
In fact, the identity of the armed group in question is still unknown <cf>, and ......
Mr. Carvein would like to speak with you guys at <cf>
He is packed at the entrance to the theater. <cf>Please visit him later!
Well, I have some preparations to make. <cf>If you'll excuse me.
Masters. Thank you for your hard work!
Carvein. How's security?
Oh, no problem. <cf>Charlotte and her team are well secured.
If the master joins us here, <cf>whoever he's up against, we'll turn back.
Mr. Feste?　Is something wrong?
Hmmm. I'm feeling a little too distracted by Charlotte's stage <cf>
The armed group is targeting Charlotte, so it's only natural that <cf>they would tighten security on the stage.
If you focus only on that, <cf>you might hit an unexpected blind spot.
It is indeed ......!　That's the master Lord. <cf>You've got a good point there.
In fact, security is concentrated on the stage. <cf>Although there is minimal placement in other areas as well. ......
From the offensive side, it may seem paltry.
Carvein, you are in charge of the stage. <cf>I and my servant will take care of the rest.
We have the most freedom of movement.
I wish I could help you too. ...... <cf>I'm afraid I'm dragging my feet in the battlefield!
You don't have to worry about it. <cf>Enjoy Charlotte's big day!
If you stay in the theater, Carvein will protect you. <cf>It's safer for us.
Yeah, I'll take care of it. <cf>I won't let them do anything they don't want to.
Please be safe.
We'll be guarding the temple <cf>where there's also a back entrance to the theater.
(Impressive) Wow. ......!
(Stabbed with knife) Ugh, geez. ......
What, huh!
What a start!
I am Charlotte, the diva of us all! <cf>Now I'm going to make you my prisoner!
Here we go!
Yes!
(Huffing and puffing) Huh!　Huh!
(Accepting the shockwave) Wow. ...... gg ...... wow!
(Attack)!　......ay!
(Attack) Huh!　Tsk ...... ng ...... deyak!
(I've been hit.) Tzuwah!
(Gotcha) uu......ts゛......dwah!
(Running to avoid the bow and arrow).......,......,......
Damn, ...... are they doing well over there?
I knew you'd show up.
What the ......? <cf>That's not what I'm talking about!
(Ready)!
Damn!　By this guy!
Do not be afraid of Battle Imagine! <cf>Do it, my servant!
Whew ...... is that all you got? ......
It's about to be a climax over there.
(Out of breath) Haaahhhh ......! <cf>Ugh!　Dah ......ツッ!
(Attack) Teaaaahhhh!　............ Hmph!
(Attack)!　Ha-ha-ha!　Nnnngh!
(Attack - hit)!　フッ　ウワ…… <cf>ア゛アッ……ッツゥ、ウッ…
(Excitement) Wow!
(Relief) ah...... phew......
Thanks, everyone!
Thank you!
Thanks!
...... seems like a lot has happened, but <cf>seems like you managed to pull it off.
Now, I have to report to Lugerio.
The Hoshinrei Festival was a success. <cf>Thank you very much for your help!
We were also able to collect more food for offerings than in previous years, thanks to the help of a new diva <cf>
Well, not everything went as planned: ......
Offerings are currently being refined. <cf>Please wait for a while.
Diva's are in a special room, <cr>dedicating a song
Once that is done, the offerings will be completed.
Not immediately, I'm afraid.
But is it a special room that produces chronograms or ....... <cf>I'm curious to see it. There might be some treasures there....
Actually, that room is part of the temple!
If it had been destroyed in the attack at the Star Festival, <cf>the offerings could not have been refined!
No way, those guys ....... <cf>Did they know that and attack the temple?
We do not know. <cf>Only a few people know the room exists.
I don't think a lone rogue will ever know. ......
Could it be that someone in a better position is pulling the strings? <cf>Who are they, more and more?
There's a boat leaving for Jubilia, Cape Rauwehara. <cf>Would you like to take it?
Would you like to go to "Cape Rauwehara"?
Beyond this point is the "Koaniani Forest."
It's where the forest people live.
If you don't have any particular need for it, don't go in.
Thanks for all your support! <cf>I'm Charlotte, everyone's diva!
I'm going to be on stage and I'm going to be perfect! <cf>Please call out with me, Se-no!
Thank you all for your support!
Take care of me, Lalaforte! <cf>God bless you in Bapharia!
I'm usually all about research, but <cf>sometimes an outfit like this isn't so bad... ♪
I'm glad to have your support! <cf>I think I might get a little addicted to the diva.
By the way, have you met Mr. Carvein at <cf>?
Actually, I might be able to find out something about the attackers of the Star Festival <cf>
Mr. Carvein has captured one of them. <cf>We are interrogating him now in the basement.
Oh, wow!　That's great! <cf>Okay, let's get going.
Yes, by all means. <cf>The basement is down the stairs on the left as you head in.
Come on, answer the question!
Who are you people? <cf>Why are you after Charlotte?
What is your purpose!
What the hell?　What's going on?
Gu......Guwah!
(look at him) ah...... ah......
Step away, Carvein!
What ...... at ......!
(Falling down) oggh!
Is this ...... poison?
No. ...... is dead. ......
Such ......!　Don't tell me you're not talking ......?
...... seems that there are more vicious people behind this than we thought.
I guess we'll have to let Lugerio handle this one.
Sorry. Could you go get Lugerio for me?
Once we all get our heads together or
I'm sure Lugerio and his team have checked the room below <cf>......
......, I see you're here.
One headache after another!
We checked the poison that the armed group man drank and <cf>Lalaforte had an idea what it was.
I think that poison is "grisonia grass".
It had a distinctive sweet smell. <cf>It is a poisonous flower that can only be found in Cape Rauwehara!
It can only be found in Cape Rauwehara ......? <cf>Is it possible for us to buy it?
No, only the locals should know about it. <cf>It's dangerous, and no one will touch it.
Selling it is a terrible idea. <cf>It is such a strong poison.
On the other hand, it's ...... a surefire way to take a life.
To increase the toxicity of grisonia grass, you need to grind <cf>fresh
Maybe there is a <cf>their hideout near the swarming area!
Um, ...... can you take me too?
I could be the decoy. <cf>Might make it easier to locate them.
I'm scared to tell you the truth, but ...... <cf>I want to know who those guys are too.
I want to see with my own eyes exactly why I am being targeted.
...... please
Master, I'm coming with you. <cf>I'm not done escorting Charlotte yet.
I'm going to expose them for what they are and make sure they never show up again. <cf>That's what I'm here to do.
I can only pray for your safety <cf>......
That's all right. <cf>You watch Tyris.
How's it going?
I don't need to tell you.
Oh dear. <cf>You can't tell the physical condition of a dragon tribe by its appearance.
And besides, you're avaritia, right?
But can I take it that you're being mature here ...... <cf>and you're not in your right mind yet?
You shut up when you get the point across, don't you, dear?
He's the most powerful king in the history of the dragon race.
Kuku Kuku ......
......Those people have driven you to this point. <cf>This is a fact you can't ignore.
You seem to be having a tough time of it, too.
I'm embarrassed to say. <cf>But it's almost over.
You don't mind if I get it first, do you?
As long as I get that woman and the avaritia shell, <cf>the rest is fine.
(looks up) Hm.
Nope.
Another one: ......
I don't know what you liked about that thing ...... <cf>but it's okay. I understand.
Well, I'll take my leave. <cf>Please take care of yourself, Dragon King.
...... so all for the sake of our beast!
Oh, no?　Looks like Omnistron has been contacted.
&lt;Sent from ...... Bachelard ......&gt;
From Bachelard?
&lt;...... shared......&gt;
&lt;As part of the cooperative body ......, we will contact you to let you know how ...... is going.
The text is very choppy. <cf>Is it the effect of space-time disruption ......?
&lt;Future ...... no change. <cf>Our time... is confirmed to be ......... years after our time... and our destruction ......&gt;
&lt; ASAP ............ <cf>............... .........&gt;
＜………………………＞
Apparently, there is no change in the future. ......
Looks like the demise remains to be confirmed as well. ......
After all, we must save Tyris. <cf>In order to avoid the future that we have seen.
Right. Take care of Tyris for me.
Yes, I'll take care of it. <cf>I hope you all are safe.
There's quite a bit of grizonia grass growing around here. <cf>Look, over to the other side!
I guess so. <cf>Let's go a little further.
(looks around) Oh, ......
Carvein?　What's wrong?
No, it's ....... I knew you looked familiar.
I got the same feeling when I came looking for Lalaforte. <cf>I've been in this area before.
......Yes, when I was a kid, I believe. <cf>Me and my parents were running away from someone [--].
Why ......? <cf>Why did you have to run away ......?
Name.
......Adelaide
Have you decided?
Yeah, I know.
This girl's name is Carvein.
(After seeing the flashback) Oh ...... oh!
What's wrong?　Are you okay, Master?
......Carvein？
(wondering) Hmm?
This one glowed and I saw ...... a strange sight.
This one glowed and I saw ...... a strange sight.
A woman named Adelaide was holding a <cf>child you ......
A woman named Adelaide was holding <cf>you as a child ......
I never thought I would come here and hear that woman's name.
(turns around) Oh!
(Turns around) Ah!
Dear Hugo, ......?
That's what it looks like: ......
Welcome to such a place, Star Spirit Diva!
You have been very active, haven't you?
(a) ......
It is you, isn't it?　 <cf>[The one who jumped us into the future!
The time!
(As if defending Charlotte) tz!
(Grinning) Hun ...... fuh.
We're going after it!
Grizonia grass grows around here.
Yes. ......
There doesn't seem to be any sign of anything unusual. ...... <cf>Is there something on your mind?
No, hey ...... it's not a big deal. <cf>Let's look elsewhere.
What about this area? <cf>There seems to be a clump of grizonia grass growing here: ......
I agree. ...... <cf>Hmmm... I don't see anything unusual at ...... either.
What's wrong?
No, it's nothing. <cf>Okay, let's try another place.
Mr. Hugo!　What are you doing here? <cf>Are you related to that armed group?
That was a lowlife hired for a pittance. <cf>I'm offended to be lumped in with them.
I am Hugo, High Civil Officer of the Principality of Bernhardt.
...... is a temporary form of worldliness.
Its actually serving as "The Beast's Apostle"!
(Question) Oh!
(Question)!
(Question) Aah!
Far in the future, a future of beautiful despair. <cf>There, the beast of [planet (star)] ate and gave birth to a life......
Chosen by the will of the planet, so to speak.
One of them is me.
The beast of [planet] ......?　The Beast's apostle, you say?
Oh, don't worry. <cf>I would never do anything so drastic as to destroy civilization.
I only want one thing.
<cr>[--] Just the woman's head there.
(As if to protect Charlotte.) ......ook!
(shrugs) Ha!
Why are you coming after me? <cf>What is the purpose of you people!
Would you like to know?　Of course you do. <cf>You don't know anything, do you?
(Miffed) Hmm--!
She knows nothing about herself, the world, or the future. ...... <cf>She is ignorant and stupid.
Wait for it!　That guy ......!
Don't wait for me, Hugo!
What am I saying?　Tell me!
I can't refuse a request from a woman. Fair enough.
Once upon a time[--].
Oh, no, it was the other way around. Far, far away in the future.
Our beast is awakened, and the future surrounded by beautiful despair.
A couple sent their newborn child <cf>far into the past!
I guess they couldn't bear to raise an innocent baby in a future of confirmed doom <cf>
But the grown baby returned to the future of its own volition and <cf>it became a great leader!
The leader of the foolish "Front for Survival" that unites the remaining human and divine tribes and <cf>defies the beast. ......
That's who you are. Charlotte.
......!
(surprise)!
Right!　Pendant! <cf>The chronogram in that one: ......
That was the one you used <cf>when you chronolepted!
That was the one you used <cf>when you chronolepted!
I'm ...... from ...... future?
(grinning) Hmm.
Wait. So you're ...... in a future where your mom and dad are ...... in a future where they're both ...... <cf>dying?
Thanks to the love of your parents. <cf>Thanks to them, you have been able to live in this age with ease.
[--]But too bad. Your parents' actions were in vain. <cf>I, of all people, will take your life.
Dear Hugo! <cf>It is useless to run any further!
Please be quiet and we won't make you feel bad!
To the son of Adelaide, the abominable avenger, <cf>and [--]
(Agitated) ah!
To the unexpected interloper [--]Omake subhuman
Who's the bonus?
Oh no, I didn't think so. <cf>I didn't realize these were so neatly connected.
Is everything as you would like it to be in the future? <cf>[--]Charlotte.
I don't know ......
Why do you mention my mother's name?
(He turned his head to look at me.) Nnnn.
Do you know anything about it?
The "Survival Front" led by you fought tearfully. <cf>Transcending races and even taking in the Bapharia Gods.
The beast [is] alienated from you, the center of it. <cf>Even an ant that will die if you step on it, it is unpleasant to be bitten by it.
We, the apostles, have decided to move for the sake of the beast. <cf>To more accurately and more surely eliminate those who stand in our way [--].
I have decided to kill you, [child][offering][of][child][offering][of][child][offering][of][child][offering][of][child][offering][of][child] sent back in time.
(Surprise.) Ah!
But just before jumping at the Chronogate, <cf>was intercepted by your entourage
...... female warrior of the divine tribe of Bapharia, <cf>Adelaide!
Every time I hear that name, my wounds tingle.
Mom, is that ......?
Same as Charlotte's ...... from the future of perdition ......
Hey, Carvein!
(Running)
Damn, shoot!
Yeah, you've been running around all over the place!
You know the bottom of the barrel. Most likely, that's how you got away from Adelaide as well <cf>
My purpose is Charlotte! <cf>I don't care about Adelaide!
(pressure) Ngugu!
She really is an abomination. The aftermath of my battle with that one, or <cf>I've been chronoleptically displaced from my specified age.
We arrived four years before the time you were sent. <cf>This is as good as I can do.
What happened to ...... mom?
Well, you know. I think you know better than I do.
This one took over 10 years to <cf>reinvent itself because of the wounds Accepted by that woman!
After all, it even appears in front of me as an Imagine Seed. <cf>What a vindictive ......
You're always getting in people's way like that.
You're going to have such a [most][period][term]!
My mom was taken from ......!
Carvein!　Behind you!
(Turns around) tz--g!
(Turns around.) Tz--!
(Surprised) Ha!
(Surprised.) Tzadz! ---- kkk.
Adventurers of the turnstiles: ....... <cf>Your presence irritates me.
(Holds himself up)!
Let's all have our heads on a pike here.
...... Is it you guys who took my mom away from me?
No, sir. No, sir?
Don't lie!
(Miffed because he doesn't believe me)
You were an excellent civil servant. <cf>Even York adored you. ......
Oh, York ...... <cf>that was a really good boy!
They moved Dunkirk just like I thought they would.
I, you know, I wanted to destroy the Bapharia cult. <cf>I wanted to eliminate everything that stood in the way of the beast.
So I decided to let Dunkirk take over the principality and <cf>damage the Order and the Divine Tribe!
But I'm not sure how to manipulate that earnest man <cf>
Yup. By deliberately making York a <cf>experiment in a pseudo-avaritia project.
We've done it.
(surprise) ts!
(Surprise) Ha!
Even though Master Dunkirk trusted ...... you?
I don't understand politics," he blurted out.
York had you as a target and then ......?
She was a good girl to remember. <cf>He didn't look like Dunkirk, I guess. He looked like his mother.
Carvein. You should not be like your mother. <cf>It's an eyesore and makes me want to kill you.
You!
(Sigh) Huh.
[--]!　Everyone!　Avoid!
(Notice.) Ha--tz!
(Noticing) Ah!
(Notice) Oh, ......!　Tz!
You're using human life as a tool. ......
(Looking at the exploding enemy) ah......
It's over there!
We can't let them get away!
Where are you going, Hugo?
......The current state of the avaritia shell is ideal. <cf>The introduction of foreign substances has made it easier to run amok.
In other words, it would only hasten the beast's awakening.
Hugo......！
But you people are trying to stop it. <cf>That is not allowed. It is an unforgivable act.
Alter the past as you wish because it is inconvenient for you. <cf>Don't you think that is selfish?
You tried to kill Charlotte, you say? <cf>And you even went to the trouble of killing her when she was a baby.
That's fine with you, isn't it? <cf>It's for the good of the beast, and by extension, the cause of saving the planet!
(In disbelief) Huh?
For the sake of the future, you must die, Charlotte.
That's our line!
(Dumbfounded) Hmph.
(Seeing how he ran away) Ah!
Let's go.
What, here ....... It's kind of creepy: ......
Well, don't you like the distortion of space-time? <cf>It's a comfortable space for me.
Hugo, I don't know what you're up to, but you can find out at ....... <cf>You're wasting your time!　This time you will not escape!
You guys are persistent too. Shouldn't your priority be to go back to <cf>past and help your friends instead of being in a place like this?
...... I'm starting to get a feel for what you're thinking. <cf>If we go back in time, it will work to your advantage, won't it?
Oh, you are not like [the Princess] who took a shortcut. <cf>If we all had that head, the beast would be pleased.
No way. ....... <cf>Every time we jump past, the beast is activated ......?
No way. ....... <cf>Every time we leap into the past the beast is activated ......?
Chronoleap is the symbol of an overreaching civilization that <cf>beast should destroy!
With each leap into the past, the beast is stimulated and activated. <cf>The avaritia shell is directly affected by it.
And your friends sink into suffering and despair.
It is you yourselves who are making things worse!
(Motion) ......!
Neither the past nor the future can be changed by you!
All this is a futile struggle, but do you still want to fight?
senior (at work or school)
Still, we'll fight.
Still, we fight.
(Accepting the avatar's determination, he turns around)!
(Accepting the avatar's resolve, he turns around.) Hmmm... ......!
...... sounds like something a self-deluded hero would say.
I don't know who you are, but ...... <cf>apparently you can't leave it behind.
Son of man.
You may be honored to be torn apart by the power of the beast. ......
Oh yeah, this guy is ......
That's why Voldigen is ......
This is it.
Kukku...... cheated you,....... <cf>I never thought such a card would be kept under the table. ......
I haven't had this much trouble since ...... <cf>Adelaide ......
What are you mumbling about?
(Spits out a smoke ball from his mouth) Pfft.
Ugh!
(surprised) tz!
(Surprised) Ugh!
Don't make a bad move!
I'm just a blind man at ......! <cf>Hugo, where are you going?
(looks around) Ugh, ugh ...... <cf>oooh--ahhh ......
It's ...... forgotten, it's a chronogate. <cf>No one uses ...... nowadays. ......
What ......!　[Isn't it only [Pillar of Divinity]!
Alicia's Lament: ......
(Suffer)
You are not going to jump!
That wound will kill you!
What the hell is this!
...... we ...... are ...... the apostles of the beast, and ...... <cf>these are some of the ways we use ......!
O beast!　[Devour me through your flesh!
(withstands impact) Ggh!
(withstands impact) Gugu!
Hahaha ...... hahahaha ......
A-ha ha ha ha!　A-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
......Despair ...... to all of it!
What ...... happened ......?
That guy is ...... Hugo only works for the beast ......
[Go to [Sanctuary of Blessings]!　Quickly!
That [utsushimi] he was talking about, <cf>isn't that the avaritia shell!
(Notice) Oh, ......!
(impatient) ......!
(impatiently) tz!
(Desperately) ts--hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Oh my God!　The avaritia shell!
All of a sudden, it started working! <cf>Nothing had happened before. ......
(Wickedly) ¡§Ha!
Hugo！？
(Surprise.) Ts, ah.
(surprise) ha ......
(Surprise)--Hah ......
Car ...... ve, in ......?
(Amazing) ha ......
(Amazing) Oh, ......
(surprised) What, ......?
Disappeared ...... was ......?
That voice of ...... mother, ......?
(Pick it up) Ah!
...... avaritia shell, I think it's called.
(Surprised) Oh.
(Surprised) Oh, ha!
That thing is activating the beast.
(surprised) ......?
Master, you guys are ......!
You've grown up strong, Carvein. <cf>I knew you had the makings of a hero.
...... you, needless to say.
Although it would be a shame to use the bastard of hope here at <cf>[--].
What are you [--]!
I can't move ......!
Because this is what I do.
Kuha!
(Suddenly able to move) tz--!
Now ...... what you tried to do ......
(painfully) ッ......
I see. ....... I see.
My [い...][つ...][も][物][物][Ya...][り...][方] doesn't seem to work.
But if we don't, the beast will wake up.
The <cf>problem will not be solved unless the avaritia shell itself is dealt with.
Processing is a ...... master!
The first step is to find an avaritia shell. <cf>You guys might want to do the same.
...... Well, let's head to the temple to hear what's going on!
But still, it's been more than a month since the avaritia shell disappeared <cf>......
Bachelard. Can you hear me? <cf>I need you to look into something for me ASAP.
The avaritia shell has disappeared. <cf>It was the work of someone called "The Beast's Apostle."[--]]
...... like ............ only ......... ...............
Bachelard?　What's wrong?
When ...... disturbed ...... positive ...... observed ...... can... .... <cf>When ......Varity......le seems to be active...... and ......... ...
Is the space-time disturbance getting worse? ......
Bachelard!　Can you at least get a hold of Shell's location at <cf>somehow!
I'm sure ...... Le is in that time period ....... <cf>After the record...... this, the dragon tribe has the shell in their hands......
Now you can share ...... this much ...... lack of power ...... forgiveness ...... <cf>ayri ...... ze, ...... at ...... basketless ......
Any further correspondence should no longer be sent to ......
I wonder if ...... avaritia shell was activated because of Hugo <cf>after all ......
It seems that Bachelard and his team do not know <cf>where Shel is. What do we do now ......
If my cutesy ears are not mistaken, <cf>you said the dragon tribe gets the shell.
Dragon Tribe...... Voldigen......
Anyway, let's go to the temple.
Yes. I may have some information for you.
I have been searching for God's [mitsuka] with all my might since then, but I have no information on <cf>.
I'm not going to go into details, and I've sent a request to the pioneer bureau, but ...... <cf>totally ......
No clue, or ....... <cf>No, any information related to the dragon tribe?
As for the dragon tribe, we are leaving the matter to the Principality of Bernhardt. <cf>It is about time you heard from us. ......
...... Actually, I'm already days late. <cf>Maybe something happened ......
Carvein was in charge of the dragon tribe, wasn't he? <cf>My servants, let us go to the Principality.
Aerinse, will you stay here? <cf>We don't know if Shell will come back.
Yes, sir.
So let's go. The sooner we get moving, the better.
Please bring the main unit of Omnistron this time. <cf>I will be sufficient with a child unit.
Huh?　Is it good?
The disruption of space-time continues. We probably won't be able to contact <cf>Bachelard for a while longer and ......
If you're here, you can get information on <cf>avaritia in Asterleeds
I am rather concerned about the avaritia in the principality. <cf>Shell could be Accepted.
I'll take it if that's what you mean. In that case, I'll take it.
The usage is not so different from the ...... child, but the <cf>engram observation can be used to estimate the location of the avalitaire
Hou ....... <cf>Hmmm ...... Hmmm ......
Okay, I've learned Feste! <cf>You can leave it to me with peace of mind!
Still, it's an amazing machine once again. <cf>I wonder how much it would be worth if sold: ......
Please keep a close eye on Mr. Feste. <cf>Never let him redeem Omnistron for cash, etc. ......
yeah
Or not!　After all is said and done!
Ah ...... haha
...... hehe
Well then, have a good trip. <cf>Please take care. ......
I apologize for the suddenness of this matter, but I have a personal matter to discuss with the King. <cf>Would you be so kind as to intercede for me?
Ha!　I have heard about you from the king. <cf>Please wait a moment.
I'm sorry. <cf>I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here because I didn't get back to you.
No, we don't like to wait either. <cf>By the way [--]
What about Carvein? <cf>I heard he's the main man in pursuit of the dragon tribe.
...... Actually, I'm not back past my appointment.
After the Dunkirk incident, that guy was obsessed with the dragon tribe. <cf>So I thought he was the right person to gather information related to the dragon tribe.
And as expected, while investigating the movements of the dragon tribe side, <cf>that dragon that ravaged our country [--].
They've got a connection between Leanbluhm and Hugo.
I had that informant Hugo was using secretly tracked down <cf>I was ......
So they are not coming back. <cf>Then we'll go check it out.
No, this is something that should be handled within the principality. <cf>It should be handled within the principality, not by your hands [--].
You don't want to move <cf>soldiers too publicly on this matter, do you?
There may still be people with Hugo's breath in their veins. <cf>That's why we can't send troops to search. ......
...... There seems to be an informant's stronghold <cf>near the caves of West Bernhardt. Carvein was headed there.
Frankly, I'm glad you guys are here. <cf>You asked for it, huh?
Aah!　Carvein!
Ah!
You are safe, aren't you?
The Master and his Lord!　Why are you here!
I heard that you had been out of touch. <cf>I heard you were tracking down an informant who has contacts with Hugo. ......
Oh, I caught that one earlier! <cf>I just asked my men to bring him in.
Oh, I must have gotten the wrong guy. <cf>Well, let's get back to the castle as soon as possible.
No, that's [--].
Whoa!　What, what the heck!　 <cf>Omnistron is at ......!
Ah!
You can find Avaritia nearby at ......!
Oh shit, he's trying to get out!
He ......? <cf>Don't tell me it's an avaritia shell!
No, no. It's not a shell. <cf>But a pretty potent avalitaire.
I was attacked <cf>when I caught an informant running off into the back of a cave.
I managed to get away with it, but I can't <cf>leave it like this.
Master, please lend me your strength!
All right, let's go. Let's go!
I'm not sure!
I never thought I'd come all this way <cf>to defeat Aberritya.
It's not something that just appears out of the blue. ...... <cf>It might be related to Hugo. Let's be on our toes.
There he is!　It's Avaritia!
He is a tough opponent! <cf>Master, be careful!
Thank you, Master and his Lord! <cf>I had my hands full just keeping them in check.
Not at all ....... But why did you and your informant <cf>run off to this place?
He was instructed by <cf>Hugo to flee here if he was ever chased by the Principality of ...... Accept
I was told that the monsters here are tamed by Hugo and that <cf>they will never attack anyone who is involved, ......
You mean that you made sure to clean up the mess even if you weren't there <cf>? You really have a bad character.
Anyway, I think we should head back to the castle. I hope that informant <cf>can connect us to where Avaritia Shell is going, even if only a little.
What's up?　Carvein.
No, it's nothing. <cf>Let's hurry back to the castle and report to the Lord King.
Welcome back, Carvein. And adventurers. <cf>The capture of the informer and the defeat of Aberritya, a great cause.
Don't be so formal. <cf>So, did you get anything out of your informant?
Yeah, he's easily spoken. <cf>I guess the betrayal by Hugo must have worked.
According to my informant, Hugo had his eye on <cf>"Koaniani Forest" before his death.
Koaniani Forest......？
It's further from Cape Rauwehara, isn't it? <cf>As I recall, it is the domain of the "forest people," who are famous for their hatred of humans.
That's right. <cf>It's a unique cultural area that distances itself from both dragon tribes and humans.
By the way, do you know what's at the end of Koaniani Forest <cf>?
Don't be fooled. That is where the dragon tribe lives. <cf>A land of extreme cold that rejects all living things. ......
Yes, it is. Perhaps Hugo was trying to gain leverage in his negotiations with the <cf>dragon tribe by having influence in that land.
Because the Dragon People and the Forest People have a <cf>non-aggression pact that they will never invade each other's territory.
I see. I see why he was inspecting Cape Rauwehara. <cf>That's a stepping stone. ......
....... <cf>For the record, the dragon tribe gets the shell: ......
The Dragon Tribe, Hugo, and the Koaniani Forest ....... <cf>Worth a visit to be sure.
I'm glad you found it useful. <cf>We will continue to gather information on the dragon tribe.
...... Your Majesty. I beg you to allow me to go to Koaniani Forest <cf>
Hmm?　What, you want to go with me?
I'd love to join you eventually, but ...... <cf>need to be allowed to go it alone for a bit.
Give your reasons, Carvein.
I felt the same way when I visited Cape Rauwehara before ...... <cf>I feel like I know that land!
Koaniani Forest is also ...... as I remember it. <cf>And, most importantly, Hugo made my mother ......
I have a feeling that ...... Avaritia Shell may be the ...... missing <cf>my mother!
Huh?　What are you talking [--]
I'm not sure yet. <cf>But it's ...... and I want to be sure.
...... Good. I will allow it. <cf>[You should value the instincts of those who stand on the battlefield.
Your Majesty. ......!
Master!　I will definitely join you later! <cf>I'll definitely be of help, so please wait a moment!
All right, we're going back to the temple in Asterleeds. <cf>If you want to know about the people of the forest, you should ask Lalaforte.
Avaritia Shell ...... or [Mitsuka] I found out where <cf>might be!
Koaniani Forest!
Koaniani Forest......！？
...... I see. No wonder our Order's intelligence network didn't catch <cf>then!
The forest people who live there hate humans. <cf>It would be troublesome to have an ambassador there.
It's just a possibility. <cf>But for now, we need to be sure of any information.
I understand. As a denomination, we will do all we can to support you at <cf>
Get Lalaforte here ASAP!
When I heard it was my turn, I flew over! <cf>I've heard what's going on, so don't worry about me.â
Well, you see, if you are going to explore Koaniani Forest, <cf>contact with the forest people is inevitable.
If you want to go see them, I can take you there!
...... but I'm an outcast from [the township (sato)], so <cf>I can really only give you directions. ......
That's enough. Thank you.
That's enough. Thank you.
Yes, we do!　Leave it to us!
Well, I'll leave first. <cf>I'll check things out over there.
I'll meet you in Jubilia later.
Aerinse, you [--]
Stay here, right? I understand. <cf>We don't even know what Voldigen is up to.
I wish ...... I had the strength to fight as much as <cf>you all do!
Sorry ......
...... sorry
No, it's my own fault. <cf>I apologize for leaving before you.
We will take good care of your absence. <cf>Please take care, everyone.
Thanks for your time!
Well, thank you! <cf>Did you see anything unusual?
...... As a bit of a curiosity, <cf>I heard of a sighting of what appears to be a dragon tribe
I saw a dragon flying over Koaniani Forest, <cf>I saw a shadow in the forest that looked like a dragon tribe, and I heard sounds of a struggle. ......
Shouldn't the forest people and the dragon tribe have signed a non-aggression pact?
Yes, I do. But I don't think the villagers are lying. <cf>Besides, [--]
Actually, some foresters trade with <cf>humans for a living!
But some people have recently had that deal cut off <cf>or ......
Muuu...... is it because of the appearance of the dragon tribe? <cf>Or is it something to do with the avaritia shells......
At any rate, let's get into the Koaniani Forest first!
This is the "Koaniani Forest". <cf>This is the area where the forest people have lived since ancient times.
It is a forest that has remained independent since the [ancient] times and <cf>continues to retain its natural state.
Oh, my beautiful hometown! <cf>Come, come with me...
Well, I can try using Omnistron for a while. <cf>Maybe I'll find something.
Oh, you're getting a response!　Is this deep in the forest ......? <cf>That's an extraordinarily strong Engram reaction. ......
Oh, what's wrong?　Is something wrong?
No, it's nothing. <cf>I was just sorting through some information.
I see. <cf>Is there anything that my knowledge could help you with?
Yes, ....... <cf>You are familiar with the terrain here, aren't you?
In terms of a map, I'd like to know about this area: ......
Which one?　Well, ...... this is ...... <cf>the place called "Graveyard of Spirits", isn't it?
What's wrong with this place?
Maybe there's an avaritia shell here at <cf>
Eh! <cf>If that's true, it could get a little messy: ......
To go to the "Graveyard of Spirits," you need permission from the Queen of the Forest People at <cf>
Where is the Queen or ......?
Deep in the Koaniani Forest ...... <cf>is the residence of the forest people called "Ulrau Village".
But the queen of the day hates <cf>humans in a circle of ordinary forest folk. Don't forget that much ......
Is it ......?　Something sounds ......
Sound?　I don't hear anything. ......
...... be vigilant!
...... right there, coming soon!
Dragon people!
Is it true <cf>that dragon tribes are invading Koaniani Forest ......
After all, this is where the avaritia shell [--].
After all, here's the avaritia shell [--].
Hmm?
Who are you ......? <cf>You are no match for that dragon tribe. ......
Kapakuku！
......, hmm?
Lalaforte!　You ......!
Do you know ......?
Yes, I am. He's my childhood friend and he's the gatekeeper of <cf>Ulrau Village.
...... Is your throat healed?
If he had stayed that way, he wouldn't have had to go back to the cult. <cf>He's an idiot.
Why did you show up again?　I told you we can't let the outcasts near <cf>
...... And this time, they're bringing a human with them.
I apologize for bringing a human being here. <cf>But it's an emergency!
In fact, it seems that a dangerous avaritia that the Order had sealed up has escaped to <cf>"Graveyard of Spirits".
These people ["] before ["] the damage was done, <cf>and they came and got it.
The dragon tribe is also after that avaritia. <cf>That's why they are breaking the [ancient] pact and invading!
Dangerous Avaritia ......? <cf>No way, that's ......
The Divine Spirit ......
Hey!　Who's there?
ha!
used to express approval, especially in slurred or unclear speech (abbr. of interjection "un")
What's that sound?
It's not good to be seen by ...... other foresters. Let's change the place.
Bring these guys to my hideout. Okay?
Go to Kapakuku's hideout. You must convince him, the gatekeeper, <cf>to enter the [sato], let alone meet the queen!
Don't worry. He's scary at first glance, but <cf>he's a good, compassionate man!
Besides, [--]
When push comes to shove, I'll take advantage of the privilege of being a childhood friend and attack <cf>with embarrassing stories from my childhood.
pooh!
There you are. The others didn't see you, did they?
You are the people Lalaforte brought in. <cf>I'll at least talk to you in the face of your childhood friend.
......It was a few years ago. <cf> Avaritia took up residence near [the township].
He was ravaging the area around [sato]. <cf>Of course, we tried to send out a strike team several times, but [--].
For some reason, the queen stopped him. <cf>She said that we should not make a rash move on someone whose true identity we do not know.
(A few years ago? <cf> for an avaritia shell, you're way off on the time ......?)
That all changed recently. With the emergence of an even more <cf>monstrosity, one that even Abaritia can follow.
More monsters?
Ah. [The people of the township call them 'spirits of the gods' with awe.
After that divine spirit showed up, the <cf>avaritia that was ravaging [the township (sato)] became all quiet.
That divine spirit, if you're interested in ......
Of course, there are those, like me, who are wary of the Divine Spirit.
But most of us are so enthralled with <cf>the divine spirit with Avalitia in tow!
If we talk about handing it over to humans, even a fool can see that it won't <cf>be free ......, right?
...... If that divine spirit is the avaritia <cf>shell we're looking for, it's a trickier situation than I thought.
I didn't realize there was a three-way war between us, the Dragon People, <cf>and the Forest People over the Avalitia Shell. ......
[--]!　Quiet.
Kapakuku...... this......
Someone is approaching [the township]. I have to go check it out.
Let me help you. <cf>We could use the manpower, couldn't we?
I'll help. <cf>It would be nice to have some manpower, wouldn't it?
...... If you see anything unusual, report it to me immediately. <cf>Don't slow me down, okay?
You there, human!　I will not allow any further intrusion!
Forest people!
You ......?　You ......?
Are you ......?　You are ......
Carvein！？
Ah ...... Master!
If it's Carvein, it's ......!
Wait, Kapakuku!　This man is not a bad guy! <cf>He's a knight of the Duchy of Bernhardt who's researching the dragon tribe.
Dear Carvein, I didn't expect to see you here <cf>. Are you here to investigate?
Oh, no, that's one thing, but ....... <cf>I'm here for something personal.
You know, you said that Koaniani Forest is <cf>in your memory.
Yeah, it's kind of oddly nostalgic. <cf>It's as if I used to live here. ......
...... you, does the name Adelaide ring a bell?
[--]!　That's my mother's name!
I knew you were Adelaide's son! <cf>No wonder you look so much like her.
Do you know my mom? <cf>I think I vaguely remember her face. ......
Well, ...... I was a turning point person in many ways. <cf>I only stayed in [the township] for a short time, but I remember
Adelaide, it was a strong warrior. <cf>I admired him as a child [--].
What happened to that Adelaide at ......?
...... dead?
...... Kapakuku. If you know Adelaide <cf>, then we can talk.
That thing you guys call a divine spirit could be Carvein's mother ...... <cf>Adelaide.
After all, is there an avaritia shell here?
I have yet to confirm with my own eyes <cf>if it is indeed Shell, as the foresters call the divine spirit.
Is that Adelaide ......?　That's ridiculous ......
Please, I need the help of the forest people! <cf>I need to see if that was my mother!
If it really is my mom, I know why she showed up here. <cf>Maybe it was a memory of being sheltered here in the past. ......
...... The Divine Spirit is at the back of the "Graveyard of Spirits". <cf>You need our queen's permission to enter there.
If you guys are willing to help me, I can take you to see the queen at <cf>[sato].
Oh!　That's a step forward!
But you have to qualify for that.
Oh, I get it! <cf>It's "Baptism in the Woods," right?　Right?
I'm going back to [the township] to report on the dragon tribe. <cf>As for the baptism, ask Lalaforte.
Let's talk about the details at Kapakuku's hideout. <cf>As long as you successfully complete the baptism, you will be able to enter [the village]!
Alright, let's see what Kapakuku said about <cf>"Baptism in the Woods".
The "baptism of the forest" is a ritual that has been handed down to the people of the forest since ancient times. <cf>Accepted baptisms are allowed into the [sato].
What you need to do is simple. Go to <cf>"Hanameguri no Komura" at the end of the road southwest of here [--].
To get the "star flower" that blooms at the far end of it. <cf>[--]That's all.
Starflower? <cf>...... What kind of features?
You'll recognize it right away. <cf>It's a glowing purple flower.
It is said that the starflower can only be obtained by those who fight the guardians who protect it and are <cf>recognized!
...... I know it's hard, but God in Bapharia approves and <cf>you guys will be fine!
Let's go, Master. We need to get to <cf>as soon as possible, considering the dragon tribe!
Is there a starflower needed for the baptism of the forest at the back of this ......
Is that what protects the starflower? <cf>Be careful, my servant!
This color is definitely a starflower! <cf>I am sure you are a brave oracle... ♪
Then, let's go report to Kapakuku. <cf>He is always at the entrance of [the township]!
You got the starflower.
Hmmm, okay. <cf>I'll accept you all as Accepted Baptizers of the Woods.
In the name of the Keeper Kapakuku, <cf>I give you permission to enter [the township].
But it is only to enter [the township]. <cf>You need the queen's permission to go to the place where the spirits are.
I will accompany you when you go to the mansion of our queen, Pipimarka. <cf>Is that clear?
Lalaforte, you are ......
I know. I'm an outcast.
This is as far as I can help you.
May the God of Bapharia bless you all.
Let's go to ....... What a waste of time.
This is the Queen's mansion. <cf>Lady Pipimarka is on the top floor.
Listen, don't be too rough with me. <cf> Here we go.
I am here at <cf>to wish those who have been baptized in the forest a happy New Year!
How about ...... One of them is Adelaide's kid. <cf>I believe his name is Carvein.
Ha, yes! <cf>I am honored that you remember me!
You were very young when you were chased by someone and fled here ...... <cf>
Adelaide hoped that until her wounded husband recovered, <cf>he had indeed helped us well in the meantime!
Because of your mother, <cf>we have learned to put our faith in people.
Aaah!
...... but I also found out that it was only because it was <cf>Adelaide!
The other two are [--].
Subhuman. That's a very unusual "type".
You are [--]
...... [piece(s)] of hope, a fragment of a wish ...... or ......
Let me ask you the purpose of your visit here.
Accepted by the baptism of the forest and also by Kapakuku, the watchman. <cf>Then I guess he is not a harmful person [--].
I don't trust ...... people.
They came to warn [the township] of the crisis.
With all due respect, I would like to advise our queen Pipimarka.
What you call a divine spirit is a very dangerous entity.
Therefore, it was captured by the Order of Bapharia and kept under strict <cf>control[--].
See ......!
You idiot!
...... Bapharia cult?
I see, you have a connection to the Order.
[We have a connection, but we are not [--].
Ugh. ......!
No, we are different! <cf>We are working for a different reason than the Order!
Whatever the reason, if it has anything to do with the cult, <cf>I won't listen to it!
Dear Pipimarka! <cf>They have come to preach the dangers of the Divine Spirit!
Thanks to the presence of the Divine Spirit, <cf>that avaritia has grown up.
Anyone who tries to break this silence unprovoked, <cf>even if they are Adelaide's children, will not be tolerated!
Queen!　That divine spirit of my mother Adelaide [--]!
Refrain, human!
！
...... I will allow you to come and go in and out of this [sato]. <cf>You can thank the baptism of the forest and Adelaide for that.
But I will not allow you to approach the spirit of the gods, not even for a single step. <cf>If you break the prohibition, I will make you the food of the forest.
Ugh ......
おっ......
Take them and leave, Kapakuku. <cf>For a moment, I don't even want to look at you.
Let's go to ....... We can't let this happen.
......ッ
You fool! <cf>Even though Master Pipimarka hates the Order!
Didn't Lalaforte tell you about this! <cf>That guy was expelled from [the township] because of it, remember?
Sorry, it's my fault. ...... <cf>What an idiot, slack-jawed moron and fool I am.
It's true, totally. <cf>I would have thought if there was an Adelaide girl, I would have .......
<span size="Big">Hit me! &lt;/&gt;
Hit me as hard as you can! <cf>I won't feel better if you don't!
No, not that far [--].
Hit me with as much cursing as you want!　Please!
What a pain in the ass, this guy!
But what can we do? <cf>They say you can't go to a place where there are divine spirits without the queen's permission.
......We know what you're capable of. <cf>Now it's just a matter of whether you're ready to wield that power.
If you want to get the Divine Spirit, then go with it. <cf>A fight with Aberritya will be inevitable.
And moreover, I hear that they are competing with the dragon tribe for the divine spirit. <cf>Can we waste any more time?
...... I see. <cf>So you're telling me to give up the Queen's permission and use force?
I don't think there's time to get lost in the shuffle.
...... What do we do?
Let's do ......
I've received your commitment. Then I'll let you meet my people.
However, never mention that you've met a fellow member. <cf>Not even to Lalaforte.
Come to "Kazemi's High Place" east of Koaniani Forest. <cf>There you will find ...... my friends.
Who are these guys?
I told you.　["]I'll let you meet my people ["]. <cf>Only a few of them are here. ......
Also known as the "Defeat Faction". They are comrades who want to defeat Avaritia and the Divine Spirit and restore peace to the <cf>forest.
Defeat ......?
Originally, we were dissatisfied with the queen's decision. <cf>Why not defeat that avaritia by force?
I don't care if there are sacrifices. <cf>It's more about the damage he does.
However, the queen remains reluctant to ....... <cf>Finally, she clings to a spirit that appears out of nowhere.
We don't want ambiguity.
If that guy is being quiet thanks to the divine spirit, <cf>we can't let this opportunity pass us by.
The queen is more than a little disturbed by the audience she just had. <cf>Now would be the time to see the opportunity.
First, the defeatist group's friends make a commotion in the vicinity of [the township].
While they're at it, we'll go into the "Graveyard of Spirits".
However, to get to the "Graveyard of Spirits", you have to go through the "Tuonela Approach" <cf>
First, let's get to that entrance.
Apparently, our people are doing well. <cf>Now, [SATO's] attention is on you.
Don't let this opportunity pass you by. Let's go!
If you pass through this path, you will reach the "Graveyard of Spirits.
No time to dawdle!　Hurry up!
Stop!
...... something, it's coming.
hmm
Oh. ......
Dragon Tribe. ......!
Are you here to take the avaritia shell?
Hmmm... Avalitas Shell is just up the road. <cf>You've picked a very picturesque place.
What's up?
Shit: ......
Acha~......
Let me state my name as a courtesy to warriors. My name is Elnigues. <cf>I am a servant and ally of the Dragon King Voldigen.
What is this courtesy, you lame-duck? <cf>Have you forgotten the [ancient] pact of mutual inviolability!
Say it, say it, say it!
For that I apologize, people of the forest. <cf>It is not in my will to [mis]promise.
......, but if it is for the sake of our allies, <cf>and by extension for the sake of our dragon tribe, then it can't be helped!
Are you the people Leanbluhm was talking about?
I heard that Frelbe was beaten by you. <cf>He said that even Voldigen had a hard time with you. ......
As a warrior of the dragon tribe, there is no better opponent. <cf>Let us meet by a single move!
Mmmm!
beer
Ah!
Ah!
Hm!
York......？
......ma
It's him!　[It's the avaritia that's been ravaging the township!
Hmmm......... hmmm!
geeaaah!
Ma...... ah, ah!
[--]Hmph! [--]Hmph!
Oh wow!
Ahhhh!　...... ah!
Ma...... ah ah ah ah!
I see his sign ....... <cf>I leave the babysitting to you.
Ts!
I've been to ......!
Oh ......ts!
Maaaaah~!
...... This is our chance to take him down. We can't let this opportunity pass us by.
Let's set it up!
Hmm!
Maaaaaaaaaaah!
Ma......aah......
We're going after him!　We're going to fold it all up at once!
Hold your feet. Rebels.
tz (measure of volume, approx. 1.8 litres)
Ack!
Lalaforte！
You can find out more at ......
Whatever one's forbidden, childhood friends are important, are they not?
You are the ones who caused the ruckus, aren't you?
Your friends are in prison. <cf>Rest assured. They are not dead yet.
A......ts......
Please visit ......!
If you disobey my orders any longer, <cf>you will have to pay the appropriate price!
Kuk ......
This is not the time for internal strife, my queen!
The dragon tribe is coming for the divine spirit! <cf>If we don't do something, they will take the divine spirit away from us!
Go to the "Graveyard of Spirits" and see how the Divine Spirit is doing. <cf>And about that avaritia.
The divine spirit is a calamity that calls for battle!
Both Avaritia and the others should be defeated!
...... of all people, you're the head of the defeatist group.
Queen Pipimarka declares. <cf>From now on, Kapakuku is relieved of his guardianship and banished.
The ......!
You are just as guilty. <cf>You should leave [your hometown] with Kapakuku.
Dear Pipimarka!
If you don't obey [--]
Stop it!
Follow ....... So ......
Sorry ....... You guys follow along.
Ahh ......
Go away early. <cf>I will send word to your friends.
ts......ck......
Oh, ...... Oh, ...... Oh!
He was unable to defeat Abaritia, the protector of the divine spirit, <cf>and then Lalaforte was taken hostage. ......
Before reaching the "Graveyard of Spirits," <cf>completely turned against the Queen of the Forest People and ......
And then there is the mighty Elnigues, a dragon tribe that seems to be getting worse and worse: <cf>Gnu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu uu ......
I think we should sit down and talk about it for once. <cf>We can borrow Kapakuku's hideout.
The situation sucks. Now let's see how we can overturn it from here: ......
First, we need to rescue Lalaforte [--].
Oh, everyone! <cf>I knew you were here!
Lalaforte!　Why you! <cf>Did you run away?
The Queen let us go <cf>right after Kapakuku and the others left.
What the hell is ......? <cf>Damn!　You're licking our chops!
I think that's ...... different
What do you mean?
I'm sorry to hold you hostage, but I don't think JoOusama meant to hurt me <cf>
At first I thought it was a bad idea, but <cf>they were very polite the whole time. Besides, [--]
When I ...... released him, he whispered to me. <cf>["]I'm sorry for making you feel horrible["]......
Would you normally say that to someone you were going to kill <cf>?
As a queen, you don't want to protect <cf>the Divine Spirit by hurting the people ......?
......We want to protect the divine spirit that makes the mysterious avaritia mature. <cf>But not to the detriment of our people.
But the mysterious avaritia that is hurting the people is not allowed to <cf>be touched in any way ...... and
I don't know... I don't know... I don't know...
...... It's as if he's using the Divine Spirit as a shield to protect <cf>avaritia
...... there must be a reason for all this.
First, let's find out what the queen is really up to. <cf>Is there anyone she knows well?
...... then I know just the person for you!
Could that be ......
Hara Oro Kava Ak. <cf>The only one who has known Master Pipimarka since he was a child.
I knew it! <cf>What?　You're going to go talk to that thing [～～～～]?
I don't have a choice!　That's the only thing I can think of.
What's going on? He's not very happy about it.
...... Well, what the heck. You'll know when you see him.
Old Man Hara lives alone in "Hellish Marshland". <cf>It's dangerous, but I'm sure you guys can handle it.
I'll go ahead and [semi][bi][bi]. <cf>You guys come back later.
Lalaforte, you go back to the Order. <cf>Because if you get caught again, there's no point.
...... I will. I will. <cf>I don't want to drag everyone down any further.
Kapakuku is right, I am returning to the Order. <cf>If I can be of any help, please give me a shout.
Oh, yes!　Please make sure to add "Sama" to <cf>when you talk to the "Mere Old Man". It's "Sama"!
Are there any people around here ......?
No choice. Let's ask that thing.
Hey, is there anyone around here named Harao Kava Ak?
......-ish?
Po-?
...... What did you just say, my dear?
Eh?　Let's see, <cf>Is there anyone named Hara Ro Kava Ak?　I mean ......
Put on your manners, you bloated bastard [----]!
Oh!
Oh!
Looks like!
Wow. ......!
～～～～！
Nah [------]!
Pop-pop!　They are so rude! <cf>It's outrageous to call them by their names when you meet them for the first time!
No, we are ....... <cf>Hmm?　You call us off?
Yes, I am the one!　I am the very great great great <cf>Hara o Kava Akpo-Po!
This is...!　You're lying!
It's not a lie. It's true.
It has been a while. Dear Haraou Kava Aku. <cf>We apologize for the inconvenience.
One of yours?　You have no discipline! <cf>This is why young people these days!
You are right to be outraged. <cf>I hope this will calm you in any way. ......
This is my favorite "Nappo's Delicious Water"! <cf>You know what you're talking about!
(...... Hey, what's that? <cf>Are you really getting to know the Queen?)
(Oh, no doubt. I've heard that Master Pipimarka used to visit this place since <cf>his childhood)
(...... Nobody likes to come to an old bigot's place. <cf>Must have been a good escape for Master Pipimarka)
Dear Kava Ak. I would like to ask you to please indulge your generous heart and <cf>I would very much like to ask you a question!
Mm, I forgive you. What do you want to ask me?
I would like to know what you think about ...... Pipimarka. <cf>What does that person think and what does he/she want to do now? ......
...... I see. <cf>I didn't know that was supposed to happen. ......
Do you have any idea what you are talking about?
...... can you give me some time? <cf>I want him to be prepared to tell others about his situation without permission.
You can come to the "Garden of the Great Sages" later. <cf>By then I will be ready. ......
...... Well, I don't know where to begin.
[It was many years ago. <cf>Bapharia's cult contacted the people of the forest.
At that time, Pipimarka was very active in external exchanges. <cf>They said, "If we don't do this, we will be left behind.
Then the cult arrived. <cf>Pipimarka gladly accepted one priest[--].
...... and so they fell in love in secret.
Ha!　The queen!　With a human!
See, it's because of people like you who react like you that <cf>Pipimarka couldn't make their friendship public.
Even though I'm struggling to fulfill my role as queen, <cf>Ale is one woman in love. I don't know how she came here to lurk.
Eventually, they had a child together. <cf>Her name was Lulmana, and she was a lovely girl.
But a short time later, the child disappeared from the presence of <cf>Pipimarka with the priest.
Only the child went back a few years. <cf>It's now ...... avaritia.
I had heard that they had been experimenting with <cf>before Avaritia Shell showed up, but not before this ......
So that's how it is. <cf>Then that figure is still [--].
Like York, <cf>you've been turned into a pseudo-avaritia experiment. ......
...... Pipimarka quickly realized that <cf>Avalitya was my child!
But he could not let the people know. <cf>After all, it was a secret love.
My child is my child even if it is avaritia. I can tell no one. <cf>But as queen, I must protect my people.
All that was left for Pipimarka was <cf>a check and balance that was said to be lenient. ......
...... I see. For Master Pipimarka, <cf>the divine spirit that calmed my child was truly a god. ......
Betrayed by the man she loved, the child she loved was <cf>made avaritia. Still, he could not escape the duties of a king. ......
That thing has suffered alone for a long time, <cf>between the board of a queen and a woman.
He is really a very sweet and whiny guy. <cf>...... Hopefully, you can save him!
But how can ......
There are ways to free the soul of avaritia.
Aerinse could do it. <cf>But I'm not sure I'd bring her in under the circumstances. ......
I'll be your escort to pick you up. Aerinse, you are at the temple in Asterleeds, <cf>, right?
Aerinse ....... That he can save the souls of Lady Pipimarka and <cf>her daughter?
...... I understand. Then I'm willing to help. <cf>When he comes to the forest, I will do my best to protect him with my friends.
Well ....... <cf>We're going to head back to our hideout and get ready for things.
I'll take care of that. <cf>I'll take care of Mr. Aerinse.
Okay, I've got a lot to ask of you. <cf>An unknown adventurer and a very old girl in a catsuit.
Who's the old man, you old shit?
I had no idea that the mysterious Avaritia was the Son of Lord Pipimarka. <cf>I didn't know that either, and what a mess I've become ......
I hear that those who have become avaritia <cf>are cut off from this world and will wander forever.
...... At least let the soul <cf>rest in peace!
The forest is frightened. ......
It's hard work!
Kapakuku! <cf>The dragon tribe has invaded in earnest!
What the hell?
They are seriously trying to take away the Divine Spirit!　If this goes on <cf>all the way to Voldigen, we're in trouble!
The king of the dragon tribe eats Avaritia to power. <cf>If the queen's daughter is eaten, she is no longer a source of power!
Hurry to the "Graveyard of Spirits! <cf>You can force your way through the approach!
Yes. ...... ......
Let's go!　We've got to hold on until Carvein comes <cf>with Aerinse!
Hey, how did this happen ......!
Hey!　Report the situation!
Kapakuku!　Oh, you ......! <cf>You came all the way here without permission [--]!
Now is not the time to say that! <cf>The dragon tribe is probably attacking us!
Oh, yeah, they fought off some of them, but <cf>they said they couldn't stop the leader dragon ......
Oh, no!　Elnigues!
What happened to Master Pipimarka!
Ho, together with other soldiers, went to the "Graveyard of Spirits" [--].
Shit!　Emergency. Coming through!
The approach to the temple is a straight shot! <cf>Let's hurry to the "Graveyard of Spirits!
Hun, nn, ay, hn, ts, hn!
Uwa, wa, wa~a~a~a~a~a~a~a
It's dangerous!　Please step back!
Mamaaaa~!
Mmm!
yikes!
Hmph!
Run away!　Run!
Ma, Ma....... Guarding ......, ......
No!　Your mother [--]
Uhu......
Please visit ～～～～～!
Huh?
Souta: ......
Dear Pipimarka. <cf>Forgive me for breaking your ban and being here.
Huff, tz, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm.
Gyaa, gyaa, gyaa, gyaa.
I heard all about it from the original elder. <cf>That was ...... your ......
Damn!
ts. ......!
Hu ...... hu ....... Oh yeah, you're known. <cf>Good, I forgive you. Laugh and [curse] all you want.
A woman who takes her own child over her people is not <cf>fit to be a king!
No one blames her for being a mother before the King. <cf>No, who can blame them?
It was moderately strong, but so far so good.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　They're going to take away the avaritia shell!
Master!
Thank you for your patience!
Oh, Carvein and Aerinse!
Dang!
I have heard about you. I know avaritia and <cf>the art of releasing souls that have been transformed.
May I use that for my ...... daughter?
Even if you can't get your body back ...... <cf>at least give your soul some peace ......
This is where we
Aerinse, please.
Aerinse, please.
Oh. Watchman ...... No, I will protect you in my name.
Let's go, Master!　To the "Graveyard of Spirits."
Ma ...... Ma ......
...... I'll let you meet your real mother.
Mom ......
Oh, ............
Lulmana~~!
Here we are!　Your mother is here!
Mom ......?
Huh ......! Ts......Ugh......Ugh......
...... Finally, we met!
Sorry, nothing ...... <cf>can do for you!
...... Mom, I love you!
I'm going to go to ...... uu......
U...... ah, ah ......!
Ahhhh ～～～～～......
'Graveyard of Spirits' ...... Here the Divine Spirit is ......!
Hurry, my servant. <cf>We cannot let the dragon tribe take it from us!
Wait!
Hmm?
That's fine. <cf>If our goals are the same, it is [appropriate] to settle the matter by force.
For warriors, <cf>[the strongman], the battle is irreplaceable. ......
Come with all your might! <cf>Let's see the power that shook Voldigen!
Hey!　You're safe!
Avaritia has been released. <cf>I hope this clears the Queen's mind a bit. ......
...... It's okay. <cf>Lady Pipimarka, we'll support you.
Come on, let's go. The spirit is back here.
Aah!
What do you mean?
Stupid ......! <cf>When I saw it, it was a giant monster!
It's being merged with ...... avaritia shells!
See: ......
Wait!　Avaritia Shell is ...... <cf>What about Mom!
or ...... mother ......?
That could be my mother! <cf>Please, tell me!
Maybe, just maybe: ......
I wondered if ...... if the fusion continues, it will become an uncontrollable <cf>'something' that is no one, 
Mother!　Wake up, please!
Wow!
ts......hah......hah......hah......hah......hah......hah......hah
The Imagine Seed!
Mother!
I am Carvein!　I am your son!
Car ......ve ......n......? I, ......
Yes, Mom!　It's me!
You are the mother of Mr. Carvein! <cf>Please let Tyris go!
Mom, please!　That man is one of us!
Huh ----
Sen ...... pai ......?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh.
Ahhhh ......
huh?
Ahh ......!
used to express approval, especially in slurred or unclear speech (abbr. of interjection "no")
--?　You......
What's that?　What is it?
Wow!
I'm not sure what you mean!
Aaah!
Grrr!
Kuh!
Kuh!　What?
What in the world is ...... what is ......
......ッ......アァ......ッツ!
Oooooh. ...... ahhh.
The rest is up to you, my brethren. <cf>Please ...... for the future of our dragon tribe. ......
You did a great job for an old guy!
......
Oh, ......
Hmmm... ......
They fought well, risking their lives.
Your work will feed Master Voldigen. <cf>Please rest in peace, [Brother] Elnigues.
Are you guys ......?
Hun
Hey, Avninte. <cf>Can I eat these guys?
What?
Aaah!
phew!
No, Ulgarm. We must <cf>present this to Mr. Voldigen as soon as possible!
abbr. of particle "ni" (used especially when it precedes the verb "naru")
......
phew
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to hurry.
......! ...... phew!
Ha ha ha!
Kuku kuku kuku ...... hahahahahaha ......!
Voldigen！！！
It seems that everyone has returned to Ulrau Village. <cf>Let's go back too.
Hey! How's it going? <cf>I'm hearing a lot of activity from across the ocean!
I can't afford to sit on my hands. <cf>So is the work of an adventurer. ......
I'd love to make Coin Pavilion's business <cf>More Big, man!
For a happy future with Myulie, <cf>we need to make sure we have a proper foundation for our lives.
Developing new customers and merchandise. <cf>Maybe even consider a second Plan store in earnest. ......
It would be a disaster if the avaritia within the Principality of Bernhardt were to be affected by the <cf>shell!
I am also concerned about Mr. Carvein and ....... <cf>I think it's important to check in with her to see how she's doing.
I'll stay here and be ready for when Shell returns, so
We hope you find Omnistron useful. <cf>Take care.
Carvein's guy is still headed to investigate the <cf>cave on the "Stahl Coast".
'Zelma Mine Ruins' I think it was ....... <cf>Apparently it involves an informant with ties to Hugo.
We can't search too openly. <cf>I'm sorry to bother you, but I need your help.
Koaniani Forest", the place where the forest people live?
I've only been as far as the neighborhood. <cf>All I know is that it is a forest that has been protected since ancient times.
I'm sure you'll have new adventures ahead of you. <cf>I'd even go with you if things were the same as they used to be.
Take care and go. <cf>I'll be expecting a souvenir story.
This is the "Granville Glaciers," the home of the dragon tribe. <cf>You need the queen's permission to pass through here.
If you don't have a permit, you can't go through <cf>
The divas continue to refine their offerings at the Temple <cf>
I'm afraid it will be <cf>difficult for us to see you freely for a while
It is a burden to them, but it is also for God's sake. <cf>Let us ask them to give themselves to us.
Tyris ...... hope everything is ok ......
No matter what they look like, just being within sight <cf>is one thing that makes me feel safe!
You can find star flowers in "Kigumu" in the "Hana-Meguri" area. <cf>The first thing to do is to go there.
Located in the south of the Silent Forest, you will find <cf>"Marae Wetlands".
I will follow after you! <cf>Don't worry, the forest is on the side of the righteous
Leave. <cf>Master Pipimarka is not pleased.
I'm surprised at you, you live so long. <cf>I didn't think there was any way to save Avaritia.
Help is coming from out of the woods. ...... <cf>We should have known more about the outside of the forest!
You will be at ease. The forest will accept you.
Aerinse and the others will save Lulmana? <cf>If so, there is no reason to refuse.
No matter how old you are, or how much of a cat you are, <cf>I trust you with everything!
By the way, Kapakuku told me that when you released the queen's daughter <cf>, is it true that she appeared before her death?
Yes, I have seen this phenomenon for the first time. I had never seen this phenomenon before.
Avaritia and pseudo-avaritia may have different <cf>souls!
If you defeat Avaritia without releasing her soul, <cf>Avaritia will be resurrected over time!
But pseudo-avaritia is ...... <cf>maybe ...... but that feeling is ......
If you defeat a monster without releasing it, it will not be revived and will remain <cf>like any other monster. ......
With that in mind, I was able to free your daughter's soul and <cf>let her see her mother at the end of her life [--].
I think it was one of the saving ......
I didn't think the assimilation of Tyris and Shell had gone that far <cf>......
In that state, it must be a hindrance to Voldigen's <cf>ambitions!
Because what you need is not Tyris, but me.
The dragon tribe will probably try to contact me. <cf>By doing so, I will be jumping into their bosom.
That's when we might have the greatest opportunity to get Tyris back <cf>
Damn you, dragon tribe. ...... <cf>How far you trample on my precious ......!
Master, I can't take it anymore. <cf>I will not forgive you even if you are the Dragon King!
I'll be with you when you fight the dragon tribe.
We will get Mr. Tyris and Mom back. <cf>I won't let anyone do what they want anymore!
What a surprise, God's [mitsuka] messenger is in the hands of the dragon tribe. ...... <cf>As usual, they are fearless!
But left? <cf>That queen's daughter is ......
No, I did not know the details of the situation. <cf>I do not wish to cause unnecessary friction with the people of the forest.
I would be delighted if this is an opportunity to improve the relationship between the Order and the Forest People <cf>
In the end, you were left to the mercy of the dragon tribe. ...... <cf>I'm sorry. We brought this on ourselves.
You guys fought for the forest and we couldn't reward you <cf>with anything.
The divine spirit must be returned to your hands. <cf>I will not let the dragon tribe have their way any longer.
I'm going to the border of "Granville Glaciers". <cf>I will be able to find out more or less what the dragon tribe is up to.
For the sake of your people, <cf>let us do what we can to help.
Finally, I was able to put that boy to sleep. <cf>It was all thanks to you. I thank you.
I was a poor mother, but <cf>I'm glad I got to see her face one last time: ......
You are the friends of the forest and the benefactors of this Pipimarka. <cf>I promise to repay this favor someday.
Do not be discouraged by hardship. <cf>Keep your eyes unclouded and follow the path you should take.
It seems that the commotion in the forest is under control. <cf>Thanks to your good work.
From now on, as a friend of the forest, you can visit me anytime at <cf>
I, the great one, would be happy to meet with you and your colleagues specially at <cf>!
Oh, and don't forget to bring a souvenir? <cf>It's called courtesy in the midst of familiarity!
Ahhhhhhhhhh... <cf>ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Were you listening to ......?
That ...... <cf>I don't want everyone to know.
Someday, when I have more confidence, <cf>I'll unveil it properly.
More importantly, did you find the messenger?
What, ...... the dragon tribe took it away from you?
The "Granville Glaciers", the world where the dragons live ...... <cf>where it is very cold ......
Good night. You take a break too?
I was just looking at the ocean for a minute.
There's a continent all the way over there ...... <cf>and Lalaforte's hometown.
I was looking for my hometown or my parents too. <cf>I never thought it would be in the future.
It's not so much across the ocean ...... as it is across the sky. <cf>Much farther away than that.
Come to think of it, you're looking for your own memories <cf>too, aren't you?
I wonder if your hometown is far away too.
I hope you can remember the old days. <cf>If there's anything I can do for you, just let me know whenever.
Phew~!　I knew it!
Oh, what a coincidence here.
Are you also looking for "Aster Tropical Dead Bomb Flavor" at <cf>?
It's a new one and it goes down your throat like a champ! <cf>It works on all the engrams in my body!
Singing for offerings during the day and researching at night. <cf>Sometimes I need to take a break like this.
Well, I'll buy another bottle!
Oh, that's right. Since we're here, I'll buy you a bottle. <cf>Won't you have a drink with me?
I just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me. <cf>I hear you've been working hard too.
Can't we at least chat for a break? <cf>Let me do the work for you once in a while, okay?
What has happened since then? <cf>I went to Master Kava Ak. ......
That's why I told you to put a 'sir' on it! <cf>Just flatter him for now....
Well, but I'm glad you're getting to know each other.
So ......?
Hmmm... ...... hmmm?　 <cf>Pseudo-avaritia is the queen's daughter?
And the other party is human. <cf>Master Kava Ak knew it from the beginning and ......!
Wait, wait, wait. There's too much information ...... <cf>I'll sort it out once and for all.
Ummm, that's this and ...... <cf>this is that and ...... OK, OK!
So, in the end, who is the [mitsuka]?
...... Did the dragon tribe take it away from you!
So, you are dealing with a dragon tribe ...... the Dragon King. <cf>It's going to be quite a dangerous journey. ......
I will be here, cheering you on as best I can! <cf>Please make sure you come back safely!　That's a promise!
...... What's he doing?
I'll let you guys know, but please don't tell anyone else at <cf>
I buried a treasure chest here. <cf>It's a record of the many ways I've been Accepted by the Order.
It started with a left turn to Minsterhorn and then <cf>such and such ......
It's not just personal, <cf>there are black rumors that can't be made public ......
I've also added some rumors I've heard recently.
And also information on places that are hard to reach by the Order. <cf>And for when someone takes over my will!
I hope that people in the future who see this will face <cf>with the cult correctly!　Hahahahaha!
I am the class master. <cf>One who masters and presides over all classes.
How about ....... <cf>You have strange eyes, my friend.
I see. No wonder everyone is talking about it.
Good. Then, in a small way, <cf>I'll be involved in your end of things.
Adventurer with the fire of destiny in your eyes, I would like to give you some advice about your "class". <cf>I would like to give you some advice on "class".
You know very well that adventurers fight in a variety of ways <cf>
You yourself may have chosen one of the classes, and <cf>are probably studying every day to master your skills.
But it is not easy to master the path
As long as you stick to one class, <cf>you will never understand that class.
Experiencing and comparing other classes is the first step to discovering the true nature of <cf>class
I will now tell you about <cf>"Class Change"
The essence of the royal road to the extreme of class. <cf>It will surely help you.
First, let's talk about weapons. <cf>Owning a weapon is essential to changing classes.
Do you know where the arms store is located? <cf>Located on the first floor of the mall.
I'll head on ahead. <cf>We'll talk again there.
You're here. <cf>Now let me tell you about class changes and weapons.
When changing classes, <cf>prepare the weapons for the new class in advance.
If you don't have a weapon to use, you won't be able to fight.
Do not forget to prepare weapons that you can equip. <cf>It is a good idea to get weapons for all classes
Weapons can be bought at these stores or <cf>crafted by yourself.
In any case, don't let it happen that you don't have a weapon when you change class, <cf>
I thought of [--] else, but I'm <cf>a little disturbed by the idea of talking to you in a storefront.
Let's change the location. The second floor of the pioneer station is good. <cf>I'll be waiting for you by the stairs. Okay, then.
Thank you for your efforts. <cf>Now let's talk about the details of the class change.
You can change your class by yourself. <cf>You may attempt it whenever you wish.
However, each class level is different. <cf>Basic stuff, mind you.
Be especially careful about classes that are new to you, or classes that are lower level than <cf>the current situation.
Combat ability returns according to level, <cf>causing unexpected accidents if you enter the battlefield unaware of it.
There is a good chance that you have switched to a weapon that you are familiar with. <cf>If you feel the same as usual, you may be confused
We must calmly assess our own situation.
The significance of experiencing multiple classes is great. <cf>It will bring so much to you.
Forward or rear guard? Even with that much change, <cf>the way the battlefield looks and stands should be completely different!
Please get to know <cf>the various classes by changing your class!
That's all the advice I have for you. <cf>Don't forget to remind yourself of it from time to time.
I wish you the best of luck. <cf>May there be light on your path to the martial arts.
Usually I am here to explore the way of the martial arts.
I may have another opportunity to give you some advice. <cf>I'd be glad if you'd visit me then.
May there be light on the path you conquer. <cf>[First, keep going.
Hey sss~! <cf>Welcome to Craftsman Plaza!
I would say ......, but seriously, sorry! <cf>I'm sorry! I've just suddenly got a lot more work to do.
I'll be glad to see you again on a new day, right? <cf>Forgive me today.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You're interested in <cf>weapon crafting if you're talking to me?
Ok, ok. Leave it to me! <cf>I'll take care of it, and it'll be perfect!
Huh?　Adventurer, haven't we met somewhere? <cf>You look familiar to me... ......
Ah!　Could it be that Jake has discovered <cf>a super-duper promising rising star?　Yikes, that's aggravating~upupupup
I'm Huovi from Imagine Institute. I'll be calling on you from now on! <cf>I'm your man when it comes to weapon crafting!
It's a joint project between the Pioneer Bureau and our IMA research center. <cf>We want adventurers to experience crafting!
I'm sure Mewtin will be happy to ask me for help. <cf>Well, it never hurts to know about crafts, right, adventurers?
I see there are three steps to crafting a weapon.
1. find a recipe for a weapon <cf>2. gather the materials described in the recipe
3. crafting with the "Rolling Ball Training Ritual" <cf>Now that I have a new weapon, I'm going to hold back!
You've been to the Reikrid Tunnels, right? <cf>If you cleared it, you must have picked up the recipe.
You can check the recipes you have and the materials you need at <cf>.
The weapons we want you to make are from the "Adventures" series. <cf>Any kind of weapons are acceptable.
Just show me your crafted weapon and you're done! <cf>I'll be waiting for you here, so good luck~!
Experiencing weapon crafting is also useful for <cf>adventurers!
Anyway, it's a weapon from the "Adventure" series. <cf>Craft them and show them to me.
If you're an adventurer, it won't take long to get it done, right? <cf>You'll get your reward for a quick and easy cleanup!　That's funny!
Good night. <cf>Oh!　You've made a great weapon!
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit!　Swallowing fast, isn't it? <cf>This is good!　Seriously, it's so exciting~↑↑↑!
Adventurers, overflowing with crafting talent! <cf>Glare☆ Glare☆ Glare☆ Glare☆ Talent shining brightly!
Crafted weapons <cf>are not all the same.
I see that many things are changing, such as Special Effects on Goblins, more <cf>sockets for attaching abilities, and so on.
It's a fun way to craft! <cf>The trick is to try it more than once.
If you find a recipe for a weapon, you can find it at <cf>!
And are you familiar with "Enhance Imagine"?
You can craft and get that thing too. <cf>It's useful for adventurers☆ I'm serious!
There's a guy named Poirier at the Imagine Institute, <cf>You might want to ask him a few questions.
Ima-ken is just outside the pioneer station on the left side of the building.
Come to me again if you need anything else. <cf>We're friends now, aren't we?　We're all friends now, right?
Good luck with your crafts and adventures! <cf>Well..!　I'm going to get a little fired up too!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! <cf>Hey, you're looking great in your gear today!
Weapons and Imagine crafting, <cf>we're going to get into the swing of things, right?
Find a weapon or an Imagine that you like. <cf>Let's show the difference to the people around us.　Let's show them!
Oh, hello there. <cf>Are you interested in Imagine?
This is the Imagine Institute. <cf>You can consult us about anything about Imagine.
I'm a bit tied up right now. <cf>I'll take care of it when things settle down.
Welcome to the Imagine Institute. <cf>Are you the adventurer Mr. Jake said he found?
My name is Poirier. I'm an apprentice at the Imagine Institute. <cf>Nice to meet you.
The Pioneer Bureau and the Imagine Institute are doing a joint project <cf>for adventurers to try their hand at crafts.
What you'll get to experience here is the craft of <cf>Enhance Imagine.
Myulie has asked me to do this for you. <cf>I'll give you the full explanation, and I'll leave it to you.
Enhance Imagine is an "equipable Imagine. <cf>It enhances the abilities of the wearer.
It's an Imagine that not only boosts ATK, but also DEF, MND, and Kokoro <cf>
Crafting Enhance Imagine is the same as crafting weapons. <cf>First we need the recipe.
The recipe for the experience is "E-Uri Uribo". <cf>If you've registered as an adventurer, you should already have it.
Enhance Imagine is crafted using a seed as the core and <cf>materials as the catalyst.
This time it's "Dynamic Engram Pieces" and "Tokoyo Grass". <cf>You can find them in the Skyquake Fields.
I accept Imagine crafts at the institute. <cf>Talk to a staff member at the counter downstairs.
Finally, just show me your finished Enhance Imagine at <cf>and you're good to go.
I'm sure it won't take long, adventurer. <cf>Well then, good luck!
I'd like you to experience the <cf>craft of Enhance Imagine's "E-Uri Uribo."
You can find the necessary "Piece of Dynamic Engram" and "Tokoyo Grass" at <cf>by looking for "Skyquake Fields".
Then ask a staff member at the counter downstairs and they'll craft you a <cf>Imagine!
When you're done, come and see me. <cf>Good luck!
Thanks for your time. <cf>Have you finished crafting Enhance Imagine?
Yeah, that's good. <cf>No problem.
Have you figured out the crafting process? <cf>You're going to be doing this a lot, so keep it in mind.
There are many kinds of Enhance Imagine. <cf>Find the recipes in your adventures and make the most of them!
And then there's Battle Imagine at the Institute: ......
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What's up, what's up, what's up?
Huovi!　Hey, what are you doing here?
I was wondering if my sister is doing her job properly. <cf>I wondered if she was doing her job properly.　He said.
I don't need you to tell me what to do! <cf>I don't want to hear it from you! Don't bother me.
Oh!　You've got Enhance Imagine! <cf>Adventurer, have you heard about Battle Imagine?
Battle Imagine is also crafted in the laboratory. <cf>The method is the same as Enhance Imagine.
Find the recipe, gather the ingredients, go to the <cf>counter, ask for it, and you're good to go.
For weapons, it's the rolling ball training ceremony. For Imagine, it's the laboratory. <cf>Remember this, Yo Roshi Ku☆.
<span size="Big">Don't take people's jobs ahhhh! &lt;/&gt;
Why are you sidestepping me?　You little charlatan! <cf>I made sure I wrote down every last thing you said!
That's because you've been doing nothing. <cf>That's why you'll always be an apprentice.
You said the answer column was off on the exam the other day too? <cf>Calm down a bit. Like me☆ who passed the exam on the first try.
You!　How dare you <cf>say something you shouldn't say just because you are a regular employee!
You're a charlatan brother!　You're my little brother! <cf>Why are you always like that, damn you!
Ha, ha. ...... I just got so excited. <cf>I'm sorry you had to see that disgusting sister-brother fight.
I have to go to ...... and study for the exam. <cf>I can't let Huovi say whatever he wants any more.
You're a charlatan brother! ...... You're a charlatan brother! <cf>Why is he the only regular employee?　I'm so disappointed!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of "Piece of Ancient Mural"?
If you find any, please collect as many as you can. <cf>If you find any, please collect as many as you can and give them to us later.
I'll be sure to return the favor. <cf>In exchange for great prizes.
It's exciting to see ancient murals shattered into pieces. <cf>That's what I call romanticism, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurer! <cf>I'm so glad you called out to us!
Welcome, adventurer. <cf>May we offer you the pleasure of our master's company?
Oh, if you don't know about this neat opportunity? <cf>Excuse me!　First of all, let me introduce myself!
I am Carnella, a messenger of the wealthy and great collector <cf>"King Collector"!
Warren, also a messenger of the "King Collector"!
Our master, "King Collector," is <cf>a man with a bottomless appetite for collecting!
Whenever I find something that interests me, <cf>I scramble to find it, no matter what it is!
Adventurers can bring it to <cf>and we will exchange it for a luxury prize!
This gorgeous prize is a rare, famous, and valuable item brought out from the warehouse of "King Collector" <cf>!
This is a great chance for adventurers to get valuable items <cf>!
My husband's focus this time around is on <cf>"Pieces of Ancient Murals".
It is a fragment of a mural painting from an ancient city. <cf>It was crumbled away in an old war.
My husband is collecting all the debris and trying to restore the <cf>mural!
It is difficult to understand the thoughts of a drunken man of leisure. <cf>Anyway, my husband's desire to collect is at full throttle
Collect as many "Ancient Mural Pieces" as you can and deliver them to us at <cf>
Speaking of which, Warren. <cf>Did you find the "Piece of Ancient Mural"?
Hahaha!　Of course I found it. <cf>I found the place where the rumblebore bites it and takes it with him!
If you defeat that one, I'm sure you'll get <cf>much more than you would normally collect.
Since I'm so out of touch, <cf>I'll at least be honest about what I saw!　Hahaha!
Yes, that's right. Mr. Adventurer. <cf>My partner seems to have missed his chance, so...
Can you take down the Rumblebores in "Minster Hills" and get the <cf>"Piece of Ancient Mural"?
Of course, all pieces found can be attributed to <cf>adventurers!
I'm counting on you, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You're right, my master is going to be very angry with me. Help me!
I won't allow my husband to miss it, though. <cf>So, Mr. Adventurer. I look forward to working with you!
Take down the Rumblebores in the Minster Hills. <cf>You should be able to get a lot of "Pieces of Ancient Mural".
The "Piece of Ancient Mural" that I collected will be exchanged for a great prize! <cf>Best regards, haha!
Oh!　Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>I see you got the "Piece of Ancient Mural"!
Your work is brilliant! <cf>I am also in awe!
Keep up the good work, collect more and more, <cf>and redeem them for gorgeous prizes!　Hahaha!
The "Pieces of Ancient Murals" seem to be scattered all over the world at <cf>
The original murals are quite large and the number of <cf>"Pieces of Ancient Murals" must be enormous!
Some monsters are attracted to engrams and carry them away. <cf>We may be able to find them by defeating them.
Sometimes, as in this case, we make the request ourselves.
If you take it on, you should be able to get a lot of <cf>"Pieces of Ancient Murals"!
Let's collect the "Pieces of Ancient Murals" and make <cf>everyone happy!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you gathered the "Pieces of Ancient Mural"?
I hear they are scattered all over the world. <cf>Keep collecting them!
Give it to Carnella and you'll exchange it for a great prize! <cf>Let's get excited!　Hahaha!
Hoo...... lost ancient murals, huh? <cf>Must be beautiful and captivating!
However!　Unfortunately, <cf>there is nothing more beautiful in the world than me!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer, how can I help you? <cf>Accepted a request to talk to a pervert?
Ah, the "Piece of Ancient Mural", isn't it? <cf>Thanks to your help, we have been able to collect them.
My husband is working hard on the restoration. <cf>However, we still have a long way to go before it is completed.
Poor mural. <cf>It still hasn't regained the beauty of yesteryear. ......
Even if we get it back, <cf>as long as this Boku is around, we will never reach the pinnacle of beauty!
Beauty is sin. Sinful me! <cf>Oh, if only I weren't here!
It's a strange coincidence, isn't it? <cf>I too think many times, "["]If only you weren't here["]".
Or, as in "Pieces of an Ancient Mural" <cf>I'm still thinking of shattering it!
Speaking of "Pieces of Ancient Murals," I forgot to mention "Pieces of Ancient Murals.
I found a clump in "Andra Basin" <cf>with Tyrant Boas swarming around it.
With my beauty-obsessed body, <cf>I wasn't in a position to get very close!
So, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Could you please take down the Tyrant Boa?
Considering the Tyrant Boa's habit of swallowing <cf>"pieces of ancient murals".
This is a chance to get a large quantity of "Pieces of Ancient Murals" at <cf>at once!
We don't want them to swallow the other pieces! <cf>Please take them down while you still can, adventurer!
I need you to take down the Tyrant Boar! <cf>The place is "Andra Basin"!
I'm swallowing chunks of "Pieces of Ancient Murals" so <cf>I'll have a chance to get a lot of them at once, haha!
You took down a tyrant boa! <cf>Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about!
As usual, you have done a wonderful job!
If we can get this many "pieces of ancient murals", <cf>we will be able to make great progress in the restoration!
Oh, by the way, Carnella. <cf>How many pieces do I have to collect?
There's the original mural, so it's not <cf>endless, right?
It is certainly not infinite. <cf>But the end is endlessly far away!
To begin with, it is a huge mural. <cf>Countless pieces are repeatedly pasted on the wall one by one.
It is a task that only our master, who has too much time and desire, <cf>would be able to handle!
The pieces that fit into the four corners of the puzzle. <cf>It is the one that fits into the corners of a jigsaw puzzle.
We have already found more than a dozen pieces at <cf>
Hahaha! <cf>It's a complicated shaped mural with several corners, isn't it?
A brilliantly toned down imagination! <cf>It means that there is more than one mural~!
Perhaps this mural was painted on the ceiling or walls of a cathedral or other <cf>massive building
It may take <cf>several decades to finish repairing everything!
That's a grand story! <cf>Our name will go down in history!
The day when he will go down as a rare unplanned bastard may come if <cf>is wrong!
Don't mind us, adventurers! <cf>Please collect the "Piece of Ancient Mural"!
Please satisfy your master's desire to collect as well as your own! <cf>Please satisfy your husband's desire to collect as well as your own!
Hahaha! <cf>Have you gathered the "Pieces of Ancient Mural"?
My husband has been getting chapped cheeks lately! <cf>I guess the mural restoration work must be hard on him!
But they shouldn't back down until it's complete! <cf>Keep delivering the pieces, adventurers!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>You've come a long way!
This is a good place, adventurer. <cf>I would like to ask for your assistance!
A powerful rival is coming to collect "Pieces of Ancient Murals"! <cf>Goblins are restoring the mural!
On the outskirts of "Soundless Foothills," <cf>an adventurer saw a strange mural!
It is a den of goblins. <cf>I heard that a mural in the process of restoration was placed there.
It was part of the very mural we are collecting pieces of and <cf>restoring!
What a surprise! <cf>The beauty of the mural attracted even the goblins!
After all, beauty is a sin! <cf>Goblins blinded by it are also guilty!
What nonsense, you pervert! You may think so, but <cf>you are not wrong!
It seems that goblins are attacking people to get "Pieces of Ancient Murals" <cf>
It is futile to ask those people to see things differently. <cf>The damage will only increase.
We can't just overlook it. <cf>And I can't just hand over the "Piece of Ancient Mural."
Could you take down the Goblin Warrior in "Soundless Foothills" <cf>, adventurer?
It is believed to be the ringleader of the goblins. <cf>Once these are defeated, the rest will be crowds.
The Goblin Warrior's majesty <cf>will leave with the mural and the pieces.
The remaining "Piece of Ancient Mural" can be taken by <cf>adventurers!
Of course, we will exchange them for gorgeous prizes! <cf>Please help us!
Go to "Soundless Foothills" and take down the <cf>Goblin Warrior!
We can't let the goblins take any more <cf>"Ancient Mural Piece" from us!
For the dream and honor of the "King Collector", I ask for your kind support at <cf>!　Hahaha!
You took down the Goblin Warrior! <cf>You are indeed an adventurer!　Thank you!
I can't thank you enough, adventurer! <cf>Thank you very much!
Now the goblins won't be able to touch the murals. <cf>And the "Pieces of Ancient Mural" will be safe!
Our master, the King Collector, also sends his thanks to <cf>
Well, well. The "Pieces of Ancient Murals" are still being collected at <cf>!
As we have said before, <cf>there is more than one mural!
The goblins almost restored it, <cf>and it was also a different picture!
Hahaha! <cf>That's worthwhile, isn't it?
Please continue to collect "Pieces of Ancient Murals" at <cf>!
The pieces and my husband's desire to collect them knows no bounds! <cf>You can exchange as many pieces as you like for gorgeous prizes!
Bring it on! <cf>I'm looking forward to seeing what you adventurers can do!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>The "Pieces of Ancient Mural" should still be collected!
Collect as many as you can, and exchange them for gorgeous prizes!
Let's all get excited about it, shall we? <cf>Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of "Fake Sweets"?
But still, that's a well-made sweet. <cf>I'd eat it without a second thought, haha!
My husband's focus this time is on <cf>"Fake Sweets".
It is a toy made to look just like a real candy <cf>It is a legacy of Bapharia!
The aroma and texture are just like sweets themselves. <cf>It is a thing that tickles the collection heart.
My husband, "King Collector"'s desire to collect has been <cf>shot through with a thud!
Fake Sweets" was used in old festivals.
Everyone dresses up in costumes and hands out candy to each other. <cf>Sounds like a fun festival, right?
The original custom was to leave some of the harvested crops in the forest so that <cf>monsters wouldn't come to the fields.
Somewhere along the line, <cf>they changed it to a festival where they give out candy!
In recent years, more and more people in Asterleeds are copying <cf>its festivities!
First, let's have adventurers pick up a copy of <cf>"Fake Sweets"!
Can you take down Uribo in the "Minster Hills"?
I found a "Fake Sweets" in that area, <cf>I've been having trouble with the Uribos coming to me.
If you defeat them, we will give you "Fake Sweets" <cf>!
This is a chance to get more than you would normally find! <cf>Please don't miss it!
Defeat Uribo in the "Minster Hills". <cf>In return, I will give you "Fake Sweets"!
We'll give away a lot of gifts, so it's a bargain! <cf>Go for the gorgeous prizes!　Hahaha!
Oh, adventurer! <cf>You got rid of Uribo, didn't you?
It was a brilliant move! <cf>Thank you from me too!
I'll give you "Fake Sweets" as promised! <cf>How do you like it?　Smells as sweet as the real thing, doesn't it?
This scent attracts monsters. <cf>Some of them take it as it is.
However, just collecting them is boring. <cf>This festival also includes a "masquerade"!
We will be presenting these "Gao Gao Gloves, Wisteria Purple - Limited" at <cf>rental!
Please try it on and enjoy the masquerade!
Hahaha!　Of course, you can show off your adventurer's <cf>prized costume!
You can match it with "Gao Gao handbags"! <cf>You can also show off your originality and individuality!
Your "Fake Sweets" will be exchanged for <cf>luxury prizes!
Please note that "Gao Gao handbags, wisteria purple - limited" will be collected after <cf>
This time of year, you may see people dressed up in costumes in various places <cf>
The slightly creepy design is a remnant of the time when <cf>we gave crops to monsters.
It is also said to be an expression of <cf>that you are a monster for receiving sweets!
Hahaha! <cf>It's best to have fun in whatever costume you want!
Collecting "Fake Sweets" and exchanging them for gorgeous prizes! <cf>Please enjoy the fun!
Hahaha!　How's it going? <cf>Are the "Faux Suites" gathering?
Seems like all sorts of monsters are attracted to the smell. <cf>I think we can get them if we take them down.
Collect as many as you can and exchange them for great prizes! <cf>I hope you can get your favorite outfit!
Hahaha!　Hey, adventurer! <cf>How's the "Fake Sweets" collection going?
Ouch!　Ouch! <cf>My tooth, my tooth hurts so much!
I beg your pardon, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>My partner is currently suffering from a cavity.
The sweet smell of "Fake Sweets" lured me to <cf>and made me want to eat the real thing!
The result of overeating is cavities. <cf>
So!　Speaking of overeating! <cf>There's a monster out there that eats "Fake Sweets."
It's a rumblebore! <cf>He's a fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat!
The sweet smell of "Fake Sweets" seems to be luring them <cf>into their mouths at random!
That's not a good thing, is it? <cf>We don't want to have our "Fake Suites" taken away from us.
So there you have it, adventurer! <cf>Could you please take down the rumblebores?
The "fake sweets" they swallowed will be presented to the adventurers as is at <cf>!
I would like to ask you to do the same, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>It would be a hindrance to the collection of "fake sweets".
While you're at it, please also get your "fake sweets" at <cf>and get your grubby hands on them!
Defeat the Rumblebores in Andra Basin and get a lot of <cf>"Fake Sweets"!
Take down the <cf>rumblebores that appear in "Andra Basin."
Because it looks like you're going to eat "Fake Sweets". <cf>Take it back with you!　Hahaha!
You took down a rumblebore! <cf>Thanks, adventurer!
We are fortunate that the person with the "Fake Suit" was <cf>before the damage was done!
This sweet scent. It seems to have been originally put on to lure monsters to <cf>
What do you mean, Carnella? <cf>It's not safe for you to do that.
Originally, the custom of placing harvested crops in the <cf>forest to keep monsters away from the fields began
Fake Sweets" was created <cf>in place of that crop!
If you spread it in the forest, the sweet scent <cf>would surely keep the monsters away.
There are other instances where it has been used to lure and <cf>trap people in the opposite direction!
Oh, by the way, some fools were lured by the aroma <cf>and ate candy until they had cavities!
Ouch! <cf>My forgotten cavity hurts!
Adventurers, don't fret. <cf>We have more great prizes to give away!
Please continue to collect your "Fake Suites" at <cf>!
Hahaha!　Adventurer. <cf>Have you been extra diligent about brushing your teeth?
Don't let your obsession with collecting "Fake Suites" <cf>disrupt your life!
The prizes won't run away from you! <cf>Take your time to collect your "fake sweets"!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you give us a minute? These kids are ......
Hey, hey!　Give me some candy!　I want some candy!
It smells so sweet! <cf>If you don't give me candy, I'll play a prank on you!
I don't want anyone messing with this very special costume! <cf>Alright, then!　Then I'll give you this!
Yay, candy!　Thank you!
Oh dear. A festival where you can get candy. <cf>The kids are still the main attraction!
Warren. Didn't you give <cf>"Fake Sweets" to the kids earlier?
Huh?　 <span size="Big">...... Ack! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, shit!　You guys!　You guys!
I don't know which one was the prank. <cf>And I think that thing was the last thing you had on hand.
That's right!　Adventurers! <cf>We're in trouble!
Actually, the peddlers were supposed to deliver "Fake Sweets" to <cf>
He says he was attacked and robbed <cf>by the Horngoats in Soundless Foothills!
As it is, I have to report to <cf>my master that ["]I have achieved zero results today["]!
Warren will be scolded. <cf>Warren will be punished.
Oh... I don't want to transcribe "King Collector's" catalog from scratch!　I don't want to transcribe the "King Collector" catalog from <cf>from scratch anymore!
Mr. Adventurer!　To prevent that from happening, <cf>I need your help!
Defeat the Horngoats at "Soundless Foothills" and retrieve the <cf>"Fake Suites"!
We will record the stolen "Fake Sweets" as an accomplishment of <cf>adventurers!
This is a prank and we cannot pass it off as a prank. <cf>Please help us, we would appreciate it!
The "King Collector" is punishing my spirit! <cf>I hope you can help me, haha!
Oh, adventurer! <cf>You've taken down the Horngoat!
Hey, sorry. <cf>I'm surrounded by kids again. ......
Hey, hey, hey, give me some candy! <cf>The candy I got before was a toy!
Give me real candy or <cf>I'll prank you this time!
Yes, yes, good children. <cf>Please forgive them with these sweets.
Yay, real candy! <cf>Thank you, sister!
I'll return the toys you gave me before. <cf>Also, we picked up some toy candy too.
I'll give it to your sister as a thank you. Here you go!
Well, goodness gracious. <cf>I guess "Fake Sweets" is back, so I guess that settles it.
I'm so proud of my outfit and I didn't get pranked! <cf>Thanks for the help, Carnella!
What are you saying? <cf>I'm just a child lover by nature.
We will charge you for the snacks later. <cf>Don't forget
Hahaha!　You're right, Carnella is tough! <cf>Thanks again, adventurers!
I'm still waiting for "Fake Sweets"! <cf>Please keep collecting and bringing them to us!
Please continue to exchange your many "Fake Sweets" for <cf>luxury prizes~!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Do you have "Fake Sweets"?
I started carrying around <cf>real candy for the kids!
It's a festival of sweet smells and mischief! <cf>Have fun, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Huff...... overflowing. It's overflowing! <cf>Men and women in swimsuits all over Asterleeds!
This is summer!　A celebration of the body under the sun! <cf>My body is also screaming with rage, hahaha!
Hahaha! <cf>You have good eyes to see that you call out to me!
Fine, you can have all of me ...... what, no?
Oh, is this about the "Shell of Sanwe"?
If that's the case, you're not a pervert, you're a--
...... your face, if you haven't heard of <cf>the event that will make the summer in Asterleeds even hotter!
Excuse me for this. Let me introduce myself again!
We are following our master's orders and seeking <cf>the "Shell of Sanve"!
Please bring your items and we will exchange them for gorgeous prizes!
The "Sanwe shells" are shells that are harvested at this time of the year. <cf>They are often used as material for ornaments. ......
My husband wants these shells very badly!
You can get "Sanwe's Shells" by wearing a swimsuit and <cf>defeating monsters!
But Carnella. <cf>It seems some adventurers don't have swimsuits, right?
Don't worry!　This is the event period. <cf>We want everyone to enjoy the event!
If you accomplish a simple request, <cf>we will rent you one swimsuit for free!
That's a good deal, isn't it? <cf>So, what do you ask of the adventurers?
I need you to take down one of the shell goblins in the Minster Hills <cf>
They are also our business rivals, so to speak, who are after "Sanwe's Shells"! <cf>We want to reduce the number of rivals!
Tropical and "Summer! The goblins are tropical and "summery!" <cf>and you'll recognize them at first glance!
Report back to me when you have them down! <cf>Thanks for your help!　Hahaha!
Go to <cf>in the "Minster Hills" and take down one of the shell goblins!
Your new swimsuit is just around the corner! <cf>Let's show everyone what you look like in your swimsuit!　Hahaha!
Oh, adventurer! <cf>You took down the shell goblin, didn't you?
Brilliantly handled ......!　I am also very impressed!
Then, as promised, swimsuits are rented for free!
You can wear this swimsuit or your own swimsuit.
Anyway, if you wear the swimsuit and defeat the monster, you will get <cf>"Sanwe's Shell"!
Rental swimsuits will be returned after the event period. <cf>Please be careful!
If you collect "Sanwe shells" and exchange them, you will get <cf>a good swimsuit that you can use forever!
Embarrassed to venture out in a swimsuit? <cf>No problem if you wear it with others!
King Collector is the very embodiment of greed, incarnation, and authority.
Where is your self-control in the face of what you want? <cf>He is not good for your children's education!
And this summer, my husband's desire to collect turned to <cf>"The Shells of Sanve"!
Luxury prizes to be exchanged: <cf>All prizes prepared by King Collector
We have a wide variety of rare and famous items! <cf>Adventurers are welcome to join us!
Please wear a swimsuit and get a "Sanwe shell" to satisfy <cf>my husband's bottomless desire to collect~!
Hahaha!　I'm looking good in my swimsuit, aren't I?
Huff, summer is nice ...... The splashing sweat and dripping seawater add luster to my <cf>sculpted body.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Why are you talking to that pervert again?
Was it in your parents' will that you should throw away your time?
But.......! <cf>Listen, Carnella, adventurer!
I'm so beautiful, but <cf>I don't know why people don't look around me!
This is not how I see it!
Everything is out of order, but let's hear the rest of the story, just in case.
I've come to realize that it's the Shell Goblins that are the culprit! <cf>It was the shell goblin that started it all!
Their glamour definitely catches people's attention.
My perfect body!　from <cf>I'm stealing everyone's attention!
Oh my!　That is a shocking story! <cf>Your misjudgment is heavenly!
Mr. Adventurer, we have no need or time to listen to <cf>such an ampontine story. But, however ......
I would like to request <cf>me to take down the shell goblins!
In addition to increasing in number at this time of year, <cf>they are also collecting "Sanwe shells" over there!
The shell goblins are a <cf>hindrance to the collection of "Sanwe shells"!
But it's also an opportunity!
Shell goblins have "Sanwe shells". <cf>If you defeat them, you can get a large number of shells!
Adventurers can win great prizes and <cf>I can have all the summer glances to myself!
Now, head to "Andra Basin" and <cf>take down five shelled goblins!
Don't forget to wear your swimsuit to collect "Sanwe shells!
In "Andra Basin," <cf>, you will take down five shelled goblins!
To take back the summer gaze directed at me and the <cf>"Shell of Sanwe"!　Please!
Hahaha!　Let's be thankful, adventurer! <cf>Now all eyes are on me!
Will I burn myself if I don't wear sunscreen?
I don't mind if you go straight to the extinguishing point. <cf>Adventurer, I would like to thank you as well!
Anyway, Carnella. <cf>Who the hell is the Shell Goblin?
You look different from the other goblins in terms of appearance and strength.
Shell goblins are thought to be individuals who play a <cf>prayer warrior-like role in goblin herds
I'm sure the goblins have their own summer festivals to show up at this time of year <cf>
So you're a goblin who is high on festivals. <cf>Summer makes all things open, you know!
And the shell goblins use <cf>"Sanwe shells" as ritual ornaments!
You mean a tasty partner?
That's right!　The "Sanve Shells" collection at <cf>is a great place to start!
I see!　Adventurers, if you find a shell goblin <cf>, try to actively take it down!
In addition!　If you proceed to <cf>for the Adventure Board we are giving you, you will receive a special Battle Imagine recipe!
If you miss out now, you never know when you will get the next one!
What a surprise!　Even just a strong adventurer like you, <cf>this is a great chance for you to monopolize the summer's gaze!
Please try the <cf>adventure board along with collecting "Sanve Shells"!
Summer is still going on!
Please satisfy our master's desire to collect <cf>with your further adventures!
Hey there!　Hey there, adventurer! <cf>How are you getting on with your "Shells of Sanwe?"
Summer is not over yet!
Get your hands on some great prizes and enjoy this summer to the fullest!
Why oh why?　Summer's gaze is <cf>not hot enough on me!
This is my perfect body and swimsuit! <cf>What's wrong with it? ......
Everywhere and everything is so weird. <cf>My partner's tongues are wagging.
I'm in trouble ...... I see!　We are all in trouble!
You must be having a hard time <cf>enjoying your summer because of the threat of the shell goblins!　That's venerable!
You have a very fertile imagination! <cf>I don't read, but why don't you become a novelist?
The shell goblin, the bane of summer! <cf>Adventurers, we have no choice but to defeat them all!
I need you to go to "Soundless Foothills" and <cf>take down 20 shell goblins!
If you kick that much out, no one will care about the shell goblins <cf>any longer!
The eyes of summer are glued to the adventurer and <cf>my perfect body!
How about it?　Adventurer. <cf>Defeated 20 shell goblins
If you successfully accomplish this, we will give you the <cf>"Shell of Sanwe" that Warren collected on his own!
Hahaha!　Why are we talking about that!
No, but!　It's for everyone's summer! <cf>Fine!　I'll pay the price as a man!
Again, don't forget to wear <cf>swimwear when collecting "Sanve shells"!
Please do your best! <cf>This is a great chance to win gorgeous prizes!
Adventurer!　I need you to go to <cf>at "Soundless Foothills" and take down 20 shell goblins!
It's for everyone's summer! <cf>I'll give away my collection of "Sanwe shells" as a reward!
Don't forget to wear your bathing suit! <cf>You won't be able to get your hands on those "Sanve shells"!
Oooooh!!!　You have accomplished the defeat of 20 shell goblins, <cf>!
This is unprecedented and unprecedented skill~!
Nothing but praise for the adventurers spills out of my mouth as well! <cf>Well, you have done a wonderful job!
Now all eyes will be on you and me for the rest of the summer! <cf>Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!
Oh, is that you guys? <cf>You're the ones who took down the shell goblins.
Well, thank you very much. <cf>Our fields were being destroyed, too, so thank you for your help.
Yes, this. Summer vegetables to share. <cf>Eat them all.
Well, well, well. <cf>I received an unexpected summer gift!
Great job, and I'm sure it will make a great souvenir for King Collectors! <cf>A nice souvenir for the King Collector!
It was worth it for me to splash <cf>on the "Shells of Sanve" too!
If 20 shell goblins are killed, <cf>there will be a buzz among the goblins!
If the presence of shell goblins in the herd becomes dangerous, <cf>they will soon disappear too!
Hahaha!　Summer is over for the Shell Goblins! <cf>From here on out, nothing can mess with our summer!
You, too, can be the center of attention in the summer with your cool swimsuit!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Have you gathered the "Shells of Sanve"?
Summer doesn't wait for you! <cf>Don't miss out on all the glances and gorgeous products!
For the best summer ever, collect <cf>"Sanwe's Shells"!　Hahaha!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of "cotton wool crystals"?
Mmmm, I love the fluffy texture. <cf>I'd love to sleep soundly on a futon like this!　Hahaha!
Welcome, adventurer. <cf>We are delighted to have you as a guest of our master's hobby.
This time, my husband's focus was on "cotton wool crystals.
At first glance, it looks fluffy, like a rabbit's tail. <cf>Actually, it's a cottony, crystallized engram.
It is a rare fluffy <cf>that is created when the climate meets certain conditions!
Hahaha!　Can you go get them together as soon as possible! <cf>...... and I'd like to say...
It seems that the goblins in Dragon Claw Valley are after <cf>this [cotton wool crystal].
After all, it's overwhelmingly fluffy. <cf>Do you think the monsters would get carried away, too?
However, it is true that it is an obstacle to collecting. <cf>It would be very serious if someone were to be harmed, sir.
Dear Adventurer. Could you please take down the goblins first and <cf>ensure their safety?
After defeating five of them, they should become a little more docile! <cf>Then we can start collecting "cotton wool crystals"!　Hahaha!
I need you to take out 5 goblins in "Dragon Claw Valley, Free Exploration", <cf>
I hope you will be able to help us collect the "cotton wool crystals" and ensure their safety! <cf>I'm looking forward to your adventurous activities!
Report back to me when you're done! <cf>Thanks for your help, hahaha!
Oh, wow!　Have you killed the goblins already?
I can't believe you accomplished it so easily! <cf>You are indeed very good at what you do!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Now you can collect "cotton wool crystals"!
But Carnella. I wonder what the "King Collector" is going to use <cf>"[cotton wool crystals]" for?
My husband's goal is to make <cf>an extra-large cushion filled with "[cotton wool crystals]"!
I've heard that one! <cf>It's that thing where the person who sleeps with you is ruined!
I wonder what will happen to my already bad husband. <cf>It's what I do every time I have too much time, effort, and greed
Hahaha!　But that's still not enough to stuff <cf>into a fluffy cushion!
We need more and more "[cotton wool crystals]!
Come on, you don't want to miss this opportunity!
Please collect "wagging crystals" and <cf>win a lot of gorgeous prizes!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>How's your "cotton wool crystal" collecting going?
It seems that "cotton wool crystals" are often attached to the surface of the monster's body <cf>
If you defeat the monsters, you should be able to get <cf>[cotton wool crystals]!
Bring them to us when you have collected them! <cf>We'll be waiting in anticipation, haha!
Hmph, my beauty is like a flower covered in cotton wool. <cf>You've been sucked in like a bee, adventurer!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. Even though you are collecting "cotton wool crystals," <cf>you don't have to go along with such fluffy behavior.
My partner's head is still in a flower garden. <cf>Should I spray herbicide on her nose?
Hahaha!　Speaking of which, I just came up with a great idea about <cf>"[cotton wool crystal]"!
The fluffy texture is just perfect! <cf>I can understand why my husband makes oversized cushions!
Then I'll try my hand at fashion!
I'm going to make a fluffy bunny suit out of "cotton wool crystals"! <cf>Don't you think it's perfect for my beautiful self?
............ Hoho
It is a good idea for Warren. <cf>It would also appeal to the public.
If it's enough for one piece of clothing, <cf>I'm sure my husband would be happy to oblige.
If you want, I will give you my permission. <cf>Why don't you make it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh!　Carnella! <cf>I never thought you would say that!
I'm glad you finally noticed my charm! <cf>I always knew Carnella was a girl who knew what she was talking about!
Well then, adventurer! <cf>May I ask you to collect materials for the rabbit suit?
I need you to go to Minster Hills and get me about <cf>10 pieces of "Tendel Yarn"!
In the meantime, I'm going to look for "Wagasa" (cotton wool crystal). <cf>It's for my wardrobe. I have to work hard!
Warren's collection of "[cotton wool crystals]" will also be <cf>exchanged for luxurious prizes for the adventurers.
In addition to my husband's greed, and my partner's shortsightedness, <cf>Please bear with us!
I'm counting on you, adventurer! <cf>Lead me to more brilliance!　Hahaha!
To show off your collection, <cf>make the best fluffy bunny suit you can!
Can you go to Minster Hills and pick up 10 pieces of "Tendel Yarn" at <cf>?
I'll collect the "cotton wool crystals. <cf>Let's finish this together, hahaha!
Oh!　Thanks, adventurer! <cf>I've got the materials for the fluffy rabbit suit!
Thank you for your time, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I thank you for your partner's share.
With this yarn and "wageshow", we can make a good costume. <cf>If you can make it, that is.
Wage crystals" are unstable engram crystals. <cf>It will dissolve and disappear over time.
Hmm?　Wait a minute, Carnella. <cf>The disappearance of the "cotton wool crystals" means that ......
I'm making a rabbit suit, too, <cf>. Doesn't that mean it's going to disappear eventually?
Oops, my mouth was somewhat smooth as I did it. <cf>I didn't realize they would notice me before I made it!
We almost saw something hilarious, but <cf>was a disappointment!
Oh my god!　I can't believe my rabbit suit <cf>was such a fleeting dream!
But Warren's idea was a good one. <cf>Thus, a large number of "[cotton wool crystals]" were gathered!
I would like to thank you once again for your adventures and present <cf>with a thoughtful gift!
This is <cf>"Adventure Board" which is useful for collecting "[cotton wool crystals]"!
If you clear it, you can get additional "[cotton wool crystals]" <cf>and even more in large quantities!
Of course, "[cotton wool crystals]" obtained at <cf>on the "Adventure Board" can also be exchanged for luxury prizes!
This is a great opportunity for adventurers! <cf>Come and try the "Adventure Board"!
Now, we are still accepting applications for "[Watage-sho]"!
Please make full use of the "Adventure Board" and <cf>to snatch the gorgeous prizes from the end!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Are you collecting "cotton wool crystals"?
Make good use of the "Adventure Board" as well! <cf>It's a great chance to get a lot of money!
The more "cotton wool crystals" we get, the happier everyone will be! <cf>Keep up the good work!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>You've come to the right place!
Our master, the "King Collector," has sent us a new directive to <cf>!
Our master, "King Collector," is trying to make a cushion with " <cf>[cotton wool crystals].
After all, the fluffiness of "Watage-shou" will make it an extremely fluffy cushion. <cf>You will be able to make the best fluffy cushion.
Isn't this a dream come true? <cf>You can wrap yourself up in fluff and have a good nap!
However, "[cotton wool crystals]" will <cf>disappear over time!
The cushions will be gone, too, so <cf>my husband will eventually wake up on the floor!
Oops, that's another <cf>dreamy story!
["]Even if you have limited time, <cf>I'd like to take a nap in the supreme fluffy ["].
What shall we call it if we do not call it greed? <cf>It is the tearful greed of our master.
So, the "King Collector" directed me to <cf>to procure fabric for the cushions.
You need the ultimate fabric that will wrap the finest fluff and not let go, <cf>!
I did some research and found that the <cf>best material can be found at a place called "Void's Island"!
Nevertheless, "Void's Island" is <cf>a place where very dangerous monsters can appear!
Hahaha!　So there you have it!　I'll get the materials from <cf>and I want you adventurers to do something about the monsters!
You need three materials, though, so you'll have to try <cf>three times for "Void's Island"!
While the adventurers are fighting, Warren will <cf>manage to collect the materials!
So, please don't worry about us. <cf>Please concentrate on the battle in "Void's Island".
The "[cotton wool crystals]" attached to the materials will be counted as if they were collected by the <cf>adventurer.
It's a chance to get a lot of "cotton wool crystals" too! <cf>Please do me a favor, adventurer!　Hahaha!
I want to collect materials for cushions in Void's Island. <cf>Can you adventurers fight the monsters?
Don't worry about the materials, I'll sneak along <cf>and pick them up!
Try "Void's Island."
You need three, though, so you have to go three times. <cf>But it should be worth it!
I'll pretend that the "cotton wool crystals" we found together were collected by <cf>adventurers.
It's a chance to get a lot of [wagella crystals]! <cf>Let's go to "Void's Island"!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>You made it back in one piece!
Thank you so much for all your help with Void's Island! <cf>Thanks to you, I was able to complete my mission!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>Looks like you got the material for the fluffy cushions too!
Even if it is a big, round body that swells to the <cf>limit with the desire and laziness of "King Collector"-sama!
Stunning!　Fluffy, supportive and enveloping <cf>It will be a supreme cushion!
Hahaha!　Even if the "cotton wool crystals" are gone, <cf>the cushion fabric should remain unbroken!
My husband should be able to feel at least the remnants of the fluff. <cf>Thank you very much!
The <cf>"[cotton wool crystals]" that Warren collected while nearly being extinguished were also the result of the adventurers' efforts!
We are still accepting applications for "Wagesho"! <cf>Please collect and exchange them as much as you can!
We support your adventures and hope you enjoy this opportunity! <cf>We hope you enjoy this opportunity!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>How are you doing?
Thanks to you, we've gathered quite a few [cotton wool crystals]! <cf>I'm glad we can fulfill our mission!
If you can get your hands on some [cotton wool crystals], <cf>, you can bring them to me!
We and our great prizes are waiting for you, adventurers! <cf>Trade to your heart's content, haha!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of the "Whitecap Tama"?
The little pieces that wash across the sea <cf>carry with them the scent of ancient cultures from faraway foreign lands.
Hahaha!　That's what romance is all about! <cf>Wouldn't you like to [touch] a glimpse of romance, adventurers?
I am Carnella, a messenger of the wealthy and great [collector] <cf>"King Collector"!
This time, my husband has his eye on the "Whitecap Jade.
Tama of Shiranami" is a small bead that was once prized <cf>in faraway foreign lands.
The picture scrolls created from thousands and thousands of beads were <cf>elegant works of art depicting the history of the country.
But the country disappeared in war and disaster, and the <cf>picture scrolls were scattered and lost!
Hahaha!　That's what the currents are doing to the <cf>Magna continent, it seems!
It was impossible for my husband not to take notice! <cf>So, I went out to gather up all the items I could find!
Since they are even going to restore the picture scrolls as they are, <cf>I must say that they have a greedy spirit to be admired.
However, there were some people who were bothering me when I was collecting "Whitecap Tama. <cf>They are goblins from the Minster Hills.
First of all, I would like you to take out 5 goblins in "Minster [Hills]", <cf>
If left unchecked, they may attack people with "[whitecaps] of [whitecaps] <cf>without regard.
Please help me <cf>to collect the "[tama] of [shiranami]" with peace of mind!　I'm asking you, haha!
Before you start collecting "Whitecaps," <cf>I need you to take down some goblins for me.
Can you please go to <cf>and take out 5 goblins in "Minster [Hills]"?
It seems that they are attacking people <cf>with impunity.
We all want to enjoy collecting "Whitecaps" together! <cf>Please lend me your help, adventurers, hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>I see you took down the goblins!
Brilliantly done! <cf>You are indeed an adventurer!
Now, everyone can collect "Tama" at <cf>without any worries!
Monsters seem to have taken them away from here and there. <cf>If you defeat them, you will find a "[ball] of [whitecaps]"!
Hahaha!　That's how I want you to collect a lot of [white wave] [tama] at <cf>anyway!
Restoring bead-weaved picture scrolls is my master's hobby. <cf>We don't need any help from adventurers.
Don't worry, don't be discouraged! <cf>Please feel free to exchange your prize for a luxurious prize!
Hahaha!　The lost romance of the exotic! <cf>How about you play a part, adventurer?
I want to make it a wonderful <cf>experience for adventurers by collecting "Whitecaps!
This is the only time of the year when you can enjoy this event! <cf>Please take a look at all the gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　It's you adventurers, isn't it? <cf>We're getting more and more "Whitecaps"!
I was so excited to see how many people had gathered that I took up the challenge of restoring the <cf>scrolls, just like my husband did!
And guess what?　A cool and <cf>dignified hero emerged, just like me!
It's just a coincidence. There are a huge number of "Tama" in "Shiranami" <cf>and you can make bead-weaved picture scrolls in any way you like!
It's not hard to create a convenient <cf>appearance by combining them to your liking!
Hahaha!　Carnella is a realist, isn't he? <cf>It's okay to be a little romantic!
The goblins who are taking the "Tama of Whitecaps" may also want to <cf>make a picture scroll featuring themselves in it, right?
[--]Oh, that's right! <cf>The goblins are in trouble, adventurer!
You took them down in "Minster Hills" before, didn't you? <cf>But the same kind of people showed up again!
What did he like? <cf>Elder Goblins appeared, robbing the "[Tama] of [Whitecap]"!
This time, we are in the Andra Basin, <cf>obstructing the collection of [Tama] in [Whitecaps]!
I'd love to expand my search, but I can't thanks to <cf>the Elder Goblins.
So there!　We need adventurers to take down the <cf>Elder Goblins in "Andra Basin"!
If we kill 10 of them, they will lose control. <cf>It will not be a problem to collect the "white wave balls"!
Incidentally, the Elder Goblin's hoard of <cf>"[Whitecaps] of [Whitecaps]" is for adventurers to take with them!
Of course, you can also get gorgeous prizes in exchange <cf>!
It's a good deal for adventurers! <cf>Have a safe trip!　Hahaha!
I want you to take down 10 <cf>Elder Goblins in "Andra Basin"!
Did they like the "Whitecaps"? <cf>It seems that goblins are collecting them too.
They can pretend that the adventurers have <cf>collected what they have!
It will ensure everyone's safety and gather 'Tama' of 'Whitecaps' too! <cf>Isn't this a great deal, hahaha?
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>You have defeated the Elder Goblins!
Excellent work, sir! <cf>You are indeed an adventurer!
Now, the collection of "Tama of Shiranami" will progress more and more at <cf>, I have no doubt about it!
The Elder Goblin's "Whitecap Balls" <cf>were also exchanged for a prize for the adventurers!
But still, we found a lot of them! <cf>The goblins seem to be collecting them with great enthusiasm!
Certainly, "Tama" in "Shiranami" is beautiful. <cf>It shines like the sweat of my beads!
Hmmm, I guess I don't know how I feel when I see <cf>that makes me want to collect goblins!
I guess we understand each other because we are similar and we are both perverts. <cf>Like brings like.
Hahaha!　I must take good care of my friends!
Adventurers should also do their best to collect the "Whitecap Tama"! <cf>It might be a good idea to cooperate with your friends!
The more monsters you defeat, the more <cf>[whitecaps] you will find!
We also offer great bonus quests and <cf>adventure boards!
If you complete the course, you will have a chance to get a large number of [Tama] of [Whitecap] at once at <cf>!
The master continues to push forward with the restoration of the picture scrolls! <cf>Luxury prizes are also being released without strings attached!
We are still looking for "Tama" of "Shiranami"! <cf>Please exchange them without hesitation!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>How are you doing with your "Whitecap Balls"?
Seems like a lot of monsters have them, so if you <cf>take them down, you should be able to find them.
The "King Collector" also said that you can never have too much <cf>to restore a picture scroll!
We have some great prizes waiting for you! <cf>Collect as many as you can and bring them to us!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Don't you think persistent goblins are frowned upon?
So that means you are disliked. <cf>Sorry for your loss, goblin.
Oops, that's a misunderstanding! <cf>I'm persistent, but I'm not a goblin!
I don't want to be lumped in with them! <cf>I'm going to be taken down by the adventurers too!
I can't deny that I think it's a good idea.　I can't deny that I'm thinking <cf>
However, we don't want all the work to come down on us. <cf>Let him live for now, Warren.
Carnella is so sweet! <cf>And I have a favor to ask of you, adventurer!
You've had goblins trying to take the "Whitecaps" <cf>down before, haven't you?
Just when I thought we were all good to go, <cf>here we go again with the same folks!
If it has come this far, there may be something in the "[white wave]'s [tama]" that draws goblins <cf>to it!
We'll proceed with that clarification separately. <cf>We have to deal with the tactless people first.
I'm sure there will be some riffraff in the near future who will attack travelers and merchants for the "Whitecap Tama" <cf>.
This time the Elder Goblins seem to be operating around <cf>the foot of the mountain in [Shizumari].
There are so many of them, and they're not going to <cf>docile until we take down about 20 of them.
I have consulted with the Pioneer Bureau and my husband "King Collector" at <cf>, but I think we need to take action first.
In anticipation of your adventurer's skill, we would like to request <cf>that you take down 20 of them!
I hope everyone enjoys collecting "Whitecap Tama"! <cf>I'm counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
The Elder Goblins who steal the "Whitecap Tama" <cf>seem to appear at the foot of the mountain in Shizumari this time.
This time there are more of them. <cf>You have to get them to take down 20 of them!
But you'll be fine! <cf>We believe in you, hahaha!
Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about, adventurer! <cf>You took down 20 Elder Goblins, didn't you?
Amazing workmanship! <cf>My husband would like to thank you for your kindness!
Thanks to the adventurers, everyone can work even harder to collect <cf>"Tama" in the [whitecaps]!
Now that we don't have to worry about goblins, <cf>we can all participate in the collection of [Tama] in [Whitecaps] with peace of mind!
We will be happy to receive it and exchange it for <cf>a great prize!
My husband is also hard at work on the restoration of the bead weaving. <cf>It will be a long time before it is completed.
Adventurers, don't worry! <cf>Please collect the "Whitecaps" to your heart's content!
If we can gather enough to fill up our master's body, <cf>we will get that many gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　The "King Collector" will be glad to see <cf>as long as we get a lot of them!
We are still waiting for your "Tama" (a ball) of "Whitecaps" to be delivered to us. <cf>This is your chance to win a gorgeous prize!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>We've been collecting the "Whitecaps" very well!
The "King Collector's" room is also <cf>about to lose its floor!
I haven't been able to keep up with the restoration work at all! <cf>Well, don't worry about that!
Collect more and more "Whitecap Tama"! <cf>Gorgeous prizes await you adventurers, hahaha!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Do you know "The Petals of Ao Kaoru"?
Hahaha!　Beautiful flower season! <cf>Beautiful like me!　Gorgeous season!
I'll share my happiness with you, adventurers! <cf>Enjoy it to the fullest!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband's focus was on the "flower petals of Seikun.
Just as beautiful as I am! <cf>They are lovely petals that smell fragrant!
It is nothing compared to the delusions of my partner. <cf>It is a beautiful blue flower that is tactless to even think so!
There is a legend that it is a flower to ward off evil. <cf>In the past, it was given as a grand gift for wedding celebrations.
This anecdote has attracted the interest of our master, the "King Collector" <cf>!
Hahaha!　The "King Collector" is going to give <cf>"[flower petals] of [blue fragrance]" to the bride and groom!
And as many as possible!　With great pomp and circumstance! <cf>To celebrate all weddings in their entirety!
For this purpose, we would like to ask adventurers to help us collect "[flower petals] of [Sei-kun] <cf>
However, there was an unexpected obstacle: ......
What a surprise!　It seems that goblins are using "flower petals of [Seikun] <cf>" as a tool of divination!
If this situation continues, "Seikun's [flower petals]" will be taken away! <cf>It is a crisis that will cause the beautiful flower to be scattered!
The equally beautiful Boku is in danger!　Pinch!
Your partner can do whatever he/she wants, whether it's divination or sacrifice, <cf>
This is not the case with the "flower petals of Seichun.
Adventurers, first of all, please go to <cf>in "Minster [Hills]" and kill about 10 goblins!
Let's get rid of the goblins and then collect "[flower petals] of [Seikun]"! <cf>I'm counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
First, I need you to take out 10 goblins in "Minster [Hills]" <cf>!
After that is done, you will be able to collect "flower petals of [Seikun] <cf>" without any worries!
Please don't let them take my beautiful flowers away from me. <cf>Please take care of them!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>Looks like the goblins were successfully defeated.
I admire your brilliant work! <cf>Now you can collect "flower petals of [Seikun]"!
The King Collector is relieved and <cf>has good news for all brides and grooms!
For a happy wedding celebration, <cf>beautiful flowers are still essential!
No, wait?　If you need beauty <cf>why don't I just visit all the venues!
You want me to send dismembered <cf>Warrens to all the venues?
It's a bit of work, but <cf>would be happy to do it if you want.
Hahaha!　After all, "flower petals of [Sei-kun]" is the best! <cf>Let's have adventurers collect more and more!
More color to the happiness of the bridegroom and bride! <cf>Please lend us your help, adventurers!
Of course, we will also have some great prizes! <cf>There are also materials for crafting "special weapons."
Please collect "flower petals of [Sei-kun]" at <cf>and exchange them for gorgeous prizes as you wish!
The man I am is beautiful, not beautiful. <cf>Beautiful, not beautiful. Beautiful, not beautiful. ......
...... No, there is no way this Boku is not beautiful. <cf>I guess this flower reading has failed!
Let's start from the beginning again! <cf>Am I beautiful or not?
I am beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. ......
Well, well, well, adventurer. <cf>What are you doing staring at a pervert's flower fortune-telling?
Even though it is a rare sight, <cf>you don't have to throw away your precious time of life.
Yes!　When it comes to flower divination, it's goblins! <cf>Adventurer!
The goblin who uses "Seikun's flower petals" for flower divination <cf>stood in front of us again!
This is the second time!　The beautiful blue color of "Seikun's [flower petals]" <cf>seems to fascinate even the goblins!
Just like that!　My own beauty!　Just like my own beauty, which was also found to be ["]beautiful ["] <cf>in the flower fortune-telling!
If you want to use your partner as a source of divination, the goblin custom <cf>is not to be dismissed out of hand.
It seems that during this season, goblins are actively <cf>repeating the divination by "[flower petals] of [Sei-kun]"!
This is the season when the "petals of the 'seikun' (blue fragrance)" shine the bluest. <cf>That is why it is the best time for wedding celebrations.
I can't give it to the goblins! <cf>I'm just trying to congratulate everyone on their happiness!
Let's agree with my partner's opinion, which is rare. <cf>Adventurer, please help us.
Elder Goblins in the "Andra Basin" seem to be particularly obsessed with <cf>the "[flower petals] of [Seikun]".
Will you take down 10 of them?
It would be a disaster if the people who collect "flower petals of [Seikun] <cf>" were to be damaged!
I'm counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Elder Goblins in "Andra Basin" seem to be taking <cf>"[flower petals] of [blue fragrance]"!
The wedding celebration will be hazy, and those who collect <cf>"[flower petals] of [blue fragrance]" are also in danger!
I need you to go to <cf>and take out 10 Elder Goblins in "Andra Basin"!　I'm counting on you, haha!
Thanks, adventurer! <cf>You took down the Elder Goblins!
The "petals of Seikun" were protected! <cf>It's like a legendary hunter wearing a flower crown!
Good job, adventurer. <cf>No wonder you are doing so well, according to Warren's words!
When "flower petals of blue fragrance" were given out for wedding celebrations, <cf>the best hunter in the village was said to have been in charge of this task.
On his head was a crown of flowers <cf>and he was honored for his role as a glorified
The house that has been given the "petal of blue fragrance" is protected by <cf>the hunter crowned with a crown of flowers.
Such is the origin of the legend!
Incidentally, it was said that the more [petals] of [Sei-kun] you collected, <cf>the better hunter you were!
Maybe the "King Collector" collects "petals of [Seikun], <cf>and has a bit of a longing to be a hunter!
My husband's plumpness is flattering ....... <cf>Therefore, we show our pride by gathering numbers!
Well, we are not bothering anyone. <cf>We have a genuine desire to celebrate your nuptials, so...
Come on, come on, please collect as many "[flower petals] of [Sei-kun]" as you can still <cf>!
The prizes are still waiting for adventurers! <cf>Gather them up and bring them to me!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Beautiful ....... <cf>My fascinating body is even more beautiful!
Wearing petals all over my body, I am now <cf>the very embodiment of timeless beauty ......
When these petals fall from my body, <cf>I should even be able to see into the future with their movement!
To approach the dubious rituals of the perverted is an act tantamount to <cf>abandonment of reason and decency, Mr. Adventurer.
If you are rational, look away; if you are sensible, ignore it altogether. <cf>If you treat it as if it does not exist, you will be at peace.
Don't worry. We don't make them use "flower petals of Seikun. <cf>The flowers on my partner's body are just that.
However!　Even though it's the same ritual, <cf>there are some things we can't just sit back and watch!
Mook and his friends' plans with the "flower petals of [Seikun]" ( <cf>), especially the big rituals!
Mooks on the "Ritze Tradeway" are gathering <cf>a large amount of "flower petals of [blue fragrance]"!
It seems that they are planning to perform some kind of ritual. <cf>I'm getting a suspicious feeling.
If it's a goblin-like flower divination, <cf>I can only imagine the ramifications of such a ritual!
I don't want them to take away the "flower petals of [Sei-kun]," and <cf>it would be a disaster if Mook and the others attacked the city!
Mr. Adventurer!　Could you please stop what Mook and his friends are up to at <cf>?
Please take down 15 Mooks from the "Ritze Tradeway" at <cf>
We will work with my husband and the pioneering bureau to <cf>take steps to prevent this from happening!
Let's hurry up and do it right!　I'm counting on you, adventurer!
I need you to go to <cf>and take out 15 Mooks on the "Ritze Tradeway"!
I can't let you use the "flower petals of [Sei-kun]" for your dubious rituals at <cf>!
Mwah, petals flew from my body ....... <cf>This must indicate a victory for the adventurer!
Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about, adventurer! <cf>It looks like you did a splendid job of thwarting Mook's ritual!
Thank you very much, adventurer! <cf>Thanks to you, there was no disturbance whatsoever!
The "flower petals" of "Seikun" were also safely gathered and my husband was very happy <cf>
Speaking of being happy, I've also received some thank you notes from grooms and brides at <cf>!
The city's weddings have become more colorful with the "flower petals of Seikun"! <cf>It's a beautiful scene full of smiling faces!
It started out as my husband's usual idea, but <cf>many people seem to be enjoying it!
This is due to the cooperation of our adventurers. <cf>We thank you again and again!
Hahaha! <cf>I hope to celebrate a lot more people!
Gorgeous prizes for adventurers! <cf>Vivid blessings to those who have been married!
Bring happiness to everyone!　Hahaha!
We are still waiting for "Flower petals of [Sei-kun]"! <cf>Have you already made the exchange?
We have also prepared a gorgeous prize that allows you to make a "Special Weapon"! <cf>Please collect as many as you can and exchange them to your heart's content!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I'm still collecting the "flower petals of [Sei-kun]"!
The "King Collector" has been well received! <cf>It seems that the bride and groom and their families have been sending their thanks!
Then the return is another problem. <cf>The "King Collector" has a difficult look on his face!
Well, you don't have to worry about it! <cf>Let's collect "petals of Seikun" and make everyone happy!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you ever heard of "King Collector Coins"?
Our owner made these coins without our permission. <cf>We don't want them being used in the stores!
I'm afraid I'll get scolded by all kinds of people if I don't collect it. <cf>I'd like your help if you don't mind!　Hahaha!
My husband has his eye on <cf>"King Collector Coins" this time.
No, I guess it's more correct to say that I spotted ...... <cf>and had no choice but to spot it.
After all, my husband made the coins himself!
It does not look like a gold coin as far as I can see. <cf>In reality, it is a toy made by my master's hobby!
He said he wanted to experience the <cf>feeling of being a Collector for once.
I've spent a lot of my personal fortune to make a <cf>pile of coins that have no particular value!
The King Collector Coins were stolen from <cf>the other day!
If they are treated as treasures or used for shopping <cf>, they are likely to be scolded from various places!
Therefore, I have been ordered to collect the "King Collector Coins" at <cf>
Please help us, adventurers! <cf>Of course, rewards will be provided!
Depending on the number of "King Collector Coins" collected, <cf>will exchange them for luxurious prizes!
I heard that the bandits in Andra Basin have <cf>"King Collector Coins".
I need you to take down about 5 of them and collect the coins! <cf>Best regards, haha!
It looks like the bandits in "Andra Basin" have <cf>"King Collector Coin"!
Let's collect it first! <cf>Go and take down five bandits!
For once, the King Collector is in a big hurry! <cf>I'm waiting for good news!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Good job on defeating the bandits, huh?
Thank you for your quick response! <cf>You are indeed an adventurer's skill!
Hmm?　Looks like the recovered "King Collector Coin" is glowing at <cf>
I mean, it's so shiny and dazzling, isn't it? <cf>I don't know if I should say this, but you are very assertive!
Because a mere coin would be lonely, <cf>my husband made it glow as an added bonus!
By the way, when you bite the coin, it glows the strongest.
I don't bite the coin, but for what?
Why don't you ask me?
Even I don't know what it means, but I'm sure <cf>"King Collector" must be very particular about it!
To begin with, this is another unintelligible situation <cf>where you collect what you make yourself!
We hope you will join us, adventurers. <cf>We will not make you lose anything!
Yes, please bring your "Whip of Love Deep Scarlet - Limited" here <cf>as a token of your "King Collector Coin" collection!
It's an accessory to gently guide the person who took the coin away from you <cf>!
The <cf>"King Collector" went to great lengths to tell people that it's not nice to take things that belong to others!
If you have time to do that, it would be better to figure out how to collect <cf>but please don't mention it!
Please note that after a certain period of time, "The Whip of Love: Deep Scarlet - Limited" will be <cf>collected!
Upon completion of certain Adventure Boards, you will receive the same type of accessory that can be used indefinitely at <cf>
As a trial period, we hope you will also enjoy the comfort of wearing <cf>the "Whip of Love: Deep Scarlet - Limited"!
So let's start punishing the undesirables and collecting the <cf>coins!
Please collect as many "King Collector Coins" as you can and bring them to us at <cf>!
Please enjoy <cf>and don't miss out on the chance to redeem the gorgeous prizes and enjoy the adventurers!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Have you collected your "King Collector Coins"?
After all, a lot of them have been stolen. <cf>We are still trying to find out who has them and where they are!
I'm sure I'll get some help from the adventurers, but I'm hoping they'll miss out on <cf>in exchange for some great prizes!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Some bandits who stole "King Collector Coins" <cf>got caught!
They were found <cf>in shambles, like they'd been attacked by wild dogs or something!
I heard that he was attacked by a herd of Highland Fox <cf>and fled in a hurry.
You stole someone's stuff. <cf>I don't blame you for getting spanked a little bit, though.
It seems that he was attacked with rather great force. <cf>It is true that I felt a bit sorry for him!
It seems that the "King Collector Coin" was the <cf>cause~!
This coin glows for no reason at all, but <cf>it is a mystery that it shines more brightly when you bite it!
When the monster bites, it glitters as well <cf>.
Hahaha!　And then the Highland Fox <cf>seemed to come along, lured by the light.
The "King Collector Coins" they'd been hoarding were taken away by <cf>the Highland Fox's nest!
Oh no, I had no idea that my husband's hobby would involve even monsters <cf>
If Highland Fox eats coins or something, <cf>it's going to get a little messy!
I feel sorry for you that you have to eat this silly <cf>stuff and get a tummy ache!
Can you please drive the Highland Fox from "Divine Haven Hill" to <cf>and collect the coins?
If you take down 10 of them, I don't think they'll come near you anymore!
It is an indisputable fact that they attacked people and took <cf>coins, even if they were against bandits.
Please give me a gentle nudge to Highland Fox at <cf>Thank you~!
The Highland Fox at "Divine Haven Hill" is collecting <cf>"King Collector Coins"!
I need you to take down 10 Highland Foxes and collect the <cf>coins!
If they eat it or something, it'll be even more trouble than it's worth! <cf>I'm just trying to get a handle on it while I can!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　You already got rid of the Highland Fox <cf>!
As one would expect from an adventurer! <cf>We were also able to collect "King Collector Coins"!
But still, "King Collector Coins" can be found at <cf>all over the place!
It looks like we need to consider not only the possibility that someone else has it, but also the <cf>monster!
I have just advised my husband to give me a little <cf>allowance because I am indeed overworked!
Can I pay you in ["]coins? ["]] When he replied <cf>I couldn't help but smile!
Hahaha!　The "King Collector" is also a <cf>daredevil, isn't he?
Adventurers, we'll make sure to exchange you for some great prizes! <cf>Don't worry!
Please continue to help us collect "King Collector Coins" at <cf>!
We look forward to your adventures~!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Looks like you're collecting "King Collector Coins"!
Don't forget to redeem your prizes! <cf>Get every last one of the prizes you're looking for!
I'm glad you're bringing more and more! <cf>I won't let the adventurers lose any money, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I've got a problem with "King Collector Coins"!
As you know, the "King Collector Coins" are only created by <cf>our master on his own!
It looks like a gold coin, but in fact it has no value <cf>!
Even adventurers would be <cf>troubled if they got this as a reward for a request, don't you think?
However, this seems to have been <cf>lost in the Arena's winnings!
What if, after a hard-fought and beautiful victory, <cf>you came up with a fake coin that glowed for no particular reason?
If it were me, I would destroy <cf>Arena in the name of "King Collector" sir!
Hahaha!　Carnella would be breakfast!
Even if they don't go that far, they usually get angry!
I'm sure "King Collector" will be scolded by <cf>many places for making a fuss about people!
I wish my husband would be punished for this <cf>
We are sorry to hear about the Arena contestants. <cf>We are also unwilling to inconvenience you
Adventurers, can you go ahead and conquer the "Rush Battle, First Level" and collect the <cf>prize money in secret?
We might get scolded for collateral damage, too. <cf>Please take care of us, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I asked you to clear "Rush Battle, First Stage!
I've got "King Collector Coins" mixed in with my prize money. <cf>It's like that. I want them collected first!
If they find out, they're going to be pissed off at rather a lot of people! <cf>Think of it as helping people, please!　Hahaha!
Congratulations on conquering "Rush Battle, First Level"! <cf>That's great, adventurer!
Your success was well received by the audience! <cf>Well done, adventurer!
We were able to recover the "King Collector Coins" and I'm glad we were able to clean up the <cf>mess before it got out of hand.
I am utterly <cf>troubled by my husband's waywardness and human disturbance!
Hahaha!　I know what you mean about wanting to make a coin to honor yourself <cf>!
Like the beautiful me, "King Collector" has a <cf>heart full of romance!
I have to agree with <cf>that my husband and partner are on the same level.
Some people think <cf>or Warren are better, just because they don't spread unnecessary confusion.
Hahaha!　I don't feel bad about the compliment!
Thank you, adventurers! <cf>Keep collecting those "King Collector Coins."
I don't know how much you've made, but <cf>it doesn't look like you've recovered it yet!
For every adventurer who collects, we have <cf>to thank you!
Please get your "King Collector Coins" and bring them to us at <cf>!
Gorgeous prizes await adventurers. <cf>Please enjoy the exchange and have fun!
Hahaha!　Hey, adventurer! <cf>How's the "King Collector Coin" collection going?
Bring a lot more! <cf>I'd love for you to try on "The Whip of Love: Deep Scarlet - Limited"!
The "Whip of Love: Deep Scarlet - Limited" will be <cf>collected after a period of time.
If you want an accessory that can be used indefinitely, try <cf>adventure board!
I don't care if you take all the gorgeous prizes! <cf>Collect lots of coins!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Do you know "Spilling Star Sand"?
Small grains of sand in the shape of stars are collected with <cf>a small wish ......
Very ephemeral indeed!　Beautiful!　Romantic! <cf>Let's enjoy the excitement together, hahaha!
This time, my husband's eyes were set on "Spilt Star Sand.
It's that beautiful star shaped sand that falls from the sky at this time of year <cf>
It is said that if you collect "Spilling Star Sand" and put it in a bag, <cf>your wish will come true!
Some of them also have unusual shapes and colors and are prized as <cf>rare!
Hahaha!　If I hear something like that, <cf>Mr. "King Collector" won't shut up, will he?
I'm trying to get a rare one at all costs. <cf>I'm raking in the "spilled star sand"!
Of course, we don't want you to have all of it. <cf>Any surplus will be distributed to the people of the town.
I hope you all enjoy <cf>collecting "Spilled Star Sand" as much as I do!
For starters, I'd like the adventurers to collect as many "Spilling Star Sands" <cf>as possible!
It's like <cf>goblins are sitting where the "Sand of Spilled Stars" falls.
People are having trouble collecting them too.
Please kill 10 goblins in "Minster Hills" and keep them away from <cf>"Spilling Star Sand"!
Even if we're looking for something rare, first we need to make sure everyone can safely collect <cf>"Spilled Star Sand"!
It rests on the shoulders of Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Best regards, haha!
I need you to take down 10 goblins in the "Minster Hills" and keep them away from <cf>the "Spilling Star Sands."
It's something that gathers everyone together and asks for favors, too. <cf>It has to be safety first!
First of all, I need your help to collect them in a safe and secure manner! <cf>Best regards, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for defeating the goblins!
Well done, sir! <cf>Now you can collect "Spilled Star Sand"!
Pray for family safety and health. Prayers for love and academic success. <cf>You will be able to make many wishes for your family.
Hahaha!　The amulet filled with "Spilling Star Sand" is <cf>kind of a tradition this time of year!
We also have leftover "Spilled Star Sand" as a good luck charm and hand them out to people in <cf>town!
Rare "Spilt Star Sand" of unusual shapes and colors will be collected by my husband at <cf>
Other than that, we will hand them out to everyone and <cf>try not to interrupt your wishes!
By the way, my husband does the sand grain sorting himself. <cf>I don't want to help him with that too!
Hahaha!　Making good luck charms is fun too! <cf>I'd love to come up with a design that everyone would be happy with!
Adventurers, don't worry about anything. <cf>Go collect a lot of "Spilling Star Sand"!
We have a great selection of prizes to exchange for the "Spilling Star Sand" at <cf>!
Please collect as many as you can and exchange them to your heart's content at <cf>!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>How's the "Spilled Star Sand" collection going?
It's often on the monster's body, so I'm sure you can get it if you <cf>take it down.
Collect as many as you can and bring them here! <cf>Gorgeous prizes await you adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Have you gathered the "Sand of Spilled Stars"?
They are as small as grains of sand, but they are properly shaped like stars. <cf>It makes me feel excited when I see it!
If I sprinkle it all over my body, I will be a shining <cf>star like a glittering star!
I can see the end result of simply being covered in sand.
Don't bother using "Spilling Star Sand", <cf>sand from the beach or thereabouts should suffice.
Hahaha!　I see! <cf>I guess that means my beauty doesn't choose the sand!
<span size="Big">And the sand has the right to choose.
But, you know what?　You can't give a bandit the right to choose the "Spilled Star Sand" <cf>!
It seems that the "Spilling Star Sand" that the town kids found <cf>has been intercepted by bandits!
Taking away a small favor. <cf>They're not beautiful!
As you can imagine, we can't leave this behind. <cf>It would be a disaster if the damage were to spread.
Adventurer. Can you please help us take down the <cf>bandits that haunt the "Andra Basin"?
We'll have a good luck charm for the kids! <cf>We don't want to let them down!
Get back the "Spilling Star Sand" and protect our children's dreams and <cf>wishes!　I'm asking you to do it, haha!
Bandits from "Andra Basin" <cf>intercepted the children's "Spilled Star Sand."
It's not beautiful to sidestep a little wish, is it? <cf>Let the adventurers take it down with a flourish!
Take back the "Spilled Star Sand" and protect children's dreams! <cf>Only an adventurer can do that!　I'm counting on you!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Beautiful accomplishment, thank you!
Defeating bandits and recovering "Spilled Star Sand"! <cf>Well done, sir!
The children have safely returned to <cf>"Spilling Star Sand"!
Instead of going back, though, it has increased to a great deal!
In fact, among the "Spill Star Sand" collected by the children, <cf>there are rare ones with unusual shapes mixed in.
The "King Collector" is willing to exchange <cf>a large amount of "Spilled Star Sand" for it!
It was a lot of food! <cf>He even had a truck full of them!
As you can imagine, it was a nuisance, so I let my husband take it home with him. <cf>The children are allowed to take as many good luck charms as they want.
Everyone was so <cf>happy to have their hands full!
Two hands full of requests!　Beautiful!
It was the best thing that could have happened to the kids and to the 'King Collector', <cf>!
All thanks to the adventurers! <cf>Thank you very much!
We are still accepting applications for "Spilling Star Sand". <cf>We have a variety of gorgeous prizes!
May you all wish upon a star. <cf>Please help us!
I hope the adventurer's request comes true! <cf>Bring me "Spilled Star Sand", as much as you want!
Defeat monsters, try <cf>adventure boards, and more!
You can find it in many places! <cf>If you find "Spilled Star Sand", bring it to me!
We have plenty of great prizes in store for you! <cf>Feel free to trade them all away!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>The "Spilling Star Sand" is gathering nicely, isn't it?
You've collected a lot and the "King Collector" is <cf>screaming with joy!
My husband checks each piece by hand <cf>for unusual shapes and colors!
It takes a lot of patience and effort. <cf>It's all for the sake of a rare collection.
If you find even one of them, you will be very happy <cf>with all the hard work you have done up to that point.
Hahaha!　I don't know how I feel about <cf>that the harder you work, the more you'll be rewarded!
When it leads to something dangerous, <cf>I'm in a bit of trouble, as expected!
The same rumors are circulating about the "Spilling Star Sand" collection at <cf>
The harder it is to collect, the easier it is to make wishes come true.
So some young people are going out of their way to go <cf>to dangerous places to look for "spilled star sand".
Have you heard of the "Soundless Foothills" of Bahamar Highland? <cf>Oh my God, they are going to go to that place!
It's somewhat too risky, so I thought I'd put a stop to it ahead of time at <cf>
Adventurers, can you help us take down the Elder Goblins in "Soundless Foothills" at <cf>?
If you see adventurers fight and hear their stories of hardship, <cf>you'll understand that it's dangerous for everyone!
Before anyone really goes <cf>please, adventurers!　Hahaha!
I want you to take down the Elder Goblins in Soundless Foothills and let everyone know that <cf>that place is dangerous.
If you get "Spilled Star Sand," <cf>you can include that in your adventurer's collection!
Before the young people really go <cf>please take care of them!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Even the monsters in "Soundless Foothills" don't seem to be able to get to you!
Brilliant work, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>The people of the city have heard of your success!
I am sure you understand that "Soundless Foothills" is a dangerous place <cf>
I'm just saying it's okay because you're an adventurer! <cf>Everyone was talking about how we shouldn't go over there.
I'd love to make your wish come true, but if you get reckless and <cf>hurt yourself, you're out of luck.
They decided to collect "Spilled Star Sand" <cf>near the city!
I understand that you may be a little overzealous, but <cf>safety still comes first!
Be moderate in your requests and your enthusiasm for them. <cf>Recklessness is strictly forbidden!
My husband is so busy looking for rare items <cf>that he almost collapses every day.
Hahaha!　I'm not going to tell the "King Collector" at <cf>!　Let's leave it alone!
Adventurers, don't worry about it. <cf>Just collect the "Spill Star Sand" and you'll be fine!
There are still more great prizes to be won! <cf>Please exchange to your heart's content!
You can get it by defeating monsters. <cf>But don't challenge reckless opponents!
Collect as many as you can and trade them in for more and more great prizes! <cf>I hope you adventurers enjoy it too, haha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Do you know "Merry Red for the Holy Night"?
Once a year, everyone makes a wish <cf>The holy night comes!
I'm sure there's a nice present in store for you adventurers! <cf>Enjoy to your heart's content!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband's focus is on "Merry Red for the Holy Night.
Small and dainty, yet vibrant in appearance. <cf>It is a lovely ornament in deep red!
It was used to decorate a healthy young tree and to wish for the growth of children <cf>used for the festival on the holy night
Hahaha!　And it's a lovely night with lots of <cf>gifts for the kids!
However, the original form of this festival <cf>is now rarely seen!
This is because "Merry Red on Holy Night" is rare and <cf>disappears like snow after a time!
Somewhere along the way, only the custom of gift-giving was left behind and <cf>young tree decorations were substituted ......
But when I hear that it is rare and hard to find, <cf>my husband's Collector spirit will not be silenced!
Hahaha!　Let's stir up some "Holy Night Merry Red" and <cf>revive the real Holy Night festivities, shall we?
In the season when "Merry Red on Holy Night" can be found, a monster called <cf>"Snow Covered Boa" will appear!
Adventurers, could you please start by defeating the <cf>"Snow-covered Boa" in the "Minster Hills"?
We will prepare a thoughtful gift for your achievement at <cf>!
There is a rumor <cf>that they have a "Holy Night Merry Red", so I want to check it out first!
To give everyone a real Holy Night! <cf>I've asked for your best wishes, adventurer!　Hahaha!
In the season of collecting "Merry Red for the Holy Night," <cf>"Snow-covered Boa" will appear together!
Can you take down one of the "snow-covered boas" in the "Minster Hills" <cf>first?
When we're done, I'll be sure to present <cf>a nice gift for the adventurers!　Looking forward to it, haha!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>You took down the "snow-covered boa!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>A good start!
So, as promised. Adventurers will receive a <cf>"Winter Spirit - Limited" costume~!
In the season when "Merry Red on Holy Night" can be found <cf>it looks like a classic costume design!
The "King Collector" wants to <cf>recreate all the festivities of the Holy Night, including the costumes!
Please note that the "Winter Spirit - Limited" costumes will be <cf>collected after the festival is over!
Costumes that are not limited to a specific time period are available at the Souvenir Exchange at <cf>. Please take advantage of it!
The more festive the festivities, the more you can make your <cf>collection of "Merry Red on Holy Night" a medal of honor!
The children seem to enjoy it. <cf>My husband's greed is sometimes useful, too.
Hahaha!　Let's get serious then and collect <cf>"Holy Night Merry Red", shall we?
'Merry Redeemer on Holy Night' is a beautiful thing. <cf>Seems like monsters like Boa and others would be interested in it.
They seem to take them in their mouths or get caught on their bodies and <cf>congregate with them!
It seems that people in the past went to a lot of trouble <cf>to collect these, haha!
To ease their hardships, some say that they dressed up in gorgeous costumes <cf>and made the city a better place for everyone!
Please try "Winter Spirit - Limited" or <cf>and enjoy your own unique look!
Hahaha!　It would be great if I could show off my <cf>personality while looking for "Holy Night Merry Red"!
The "Merry Red of the Holy Night" collected will be exchanged for gorgeous prizes at <cf>!
A wonderful gift for adventurers! <cf>We have plenty to offer, so don't hesitate to contact us!
Collecting Merry Red on Holy Night is part of the festival! <cf>Enjoy yourselves to the fullest, adventurers!
Let's put on our costumes, exchange more and more gifts, and make <cf>the best Holy Night ever!　Hahaha!
Adventurers!　Is the "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night" gathering <cf>going well?
You can exchange them for gorgeous prizes. <cf>Please collect them and bring them to us!
If you're going to go to all this trouble, why not enjoy some unique costumes? <cf>Let's all make the Holy Night a great time together, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>Is the "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night" gathering?
To make the festivities more exciting, <cf>we also prepared young trees for decoration!
The "Holy Night Merry Red" and <cf>gifts are a must for the Holy Night festivities!
And a <cf>fine young tree to decorate the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" is also essential~!
It is a wish that the children will grow up straight <cf>and big like this young tree!
Not only us, but I'm sure each of you have <cf>young trees in your homes!
However, an unexpected interloper appeared.
It's a "snow-covered boa! <cf>Young trees and buds are their favorite food!
I'd put "Holy Night Merry Red" in my mouth too. <cf>I'm really in trouble!
However!　Conversely, if we can take down the "snow-covered boa" <cf>, all is well!
The young tree will be protected and the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" will be available. <cf>It's the best present for everyone who enjoys the festival!
If they eat up all the young trees, we won't be able to <cf>have a Holy Night festival next year!
Please help us collect "Merry Red on Holy Night" and also help us protect <cf>future festivals!
Could you please take down about <cf>7 "snow-covered boas" in "Andra Basin"?
That should protect the young trees! <cf>I'm asking you for everyone's sake, adventurer!　Hahaha!
I need you to go to <cf>and take out about 7 of the "snow-covered boas" in the "Andra Basin."
They'll devour the young trees for the festival. <cf>We must punish them for next year and beyond!
You'll get your "Holy Night Merry Red," too, so don't forget to redeem it for some of those <cf>luxury prizes!　Hahaha!
Thank you!　Thanks to the adventurers, <cf>the young trees for the festival were protected!
Now everyone should be able to decorate their "Holy Night Merry Red" <cf>without worrying!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>I would like to thank you as well~!
A gift for the young tree on "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night." <cf>After all, it is an essential part of this festival!
Incidentally, the glow of the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" is <cf>also said to be a light to ward off evil.
They decorated it with <cf>holy light to protect the young trees and children from bad things!
Hahaha!　Then it makes sense for the "King Collector" to collect <cf>"Holy Night Merry Red"!
The more the city is decorated with "Merry Red on Holy Night" <cf>the more the kids should be able to sleep peacefully!
It's just a coincidence brought about by my husband's greed and waywardness. <cf>Warren says some good things sometimes.
Parents may place gifts under their children's pillows at <cf>and we hope they have good dreams!
That's why we need "Merry Red for the Holy Night"! <cf>Let's collect as many as we can before the shine fades!
The same great prizes are still waiting for adventurers!
It is the season of winter. <cf>Please enjoy our costumes and accessories if you like.
Please collect "Merry Red of the Holy Night" at <cf>and exchange it for gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>The "Holy Night Merry Red" is still waiting for you!
And there are tons of great prizes! <cf>It's like a present for adventurers!
It's the festival of the Holy Night. <cf>Enjoy the costumes and all!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thanks to the adventurers at <cf>I'm full of "Holy Night Merry Red"!
There are decorations in many places. <cf>The kids are happy to see them!
My husband is also very satisfied. <cf>Thank you, Mr. Adventurer.
Now that the decorations are up, we are rushing to get <cf>presents for the kids!
Hahaha!　The "King Collector" likes to <cf>collect and give away!
Often, when people are interested in my collection, I give <cf>generously!
You can release your collection in the name of a gift. <cf>It seems like the best festival for my husband!
It's great to see the town thriving in this way, but <cf>there are a few customers who are a bit distressed.
More and more people are saying they've seen "Snow Covered Boa. <cf>Apparently, the number is increasing.
The festive atmosphere is so exciting <cf>that it would be a disaster if someone were to attack someone else!
They want to take them all out in one fell swoop before they cause a ruckus.
We are asking adventurers to <cf>take down 20 "snow-covered boas"!
It's a somewhat daunting number, but <cf>I thought this would be a good opportunity to get rid of the anxiety all together.
Hahaha!　I want the kids to feel safe <cf>because I want them to receive their gifts!
The "snow-covered boa" in question seems to be at <cf>"Soundless Foothills"
I'm sure there will be plenty of Merry Reds to go around. <cf>Please help us defeat the snow-covered boa!
I need you to take down a <cf>"snow-covered boa" in the "Soundless Foothills" of Bahamar Highland.
My goal is 20!　I know it's a bit daunting, but with your <cf>adventurous abilities, you'll be fine!
There should be plenty of "Holy Night Merry Red" available, and <cf>adventurers should win some great prizes!
Good job, adventurers! <cf>Thank you for defeating the "snow-covered boa!
Thank you for the massive amount of defeats, adventurer! <cf>I am very impressed with your skill!
Now you can enjoy the festivities of the Holy Night without a hitch. <cf>We must prepare a gift for you too!
Hahaha!　What a gift from <cf>adventurers to be able to enjoy the festivities together!
A brilliant metaphor, not unlike my partner! <cf>It is truly the best present I have ever received!
I am sure <cf>everyone will be talking about the festival and the adventurers next year and after that!
Now, as for "Merry Red on Holy Night", <cf>we are still waiting for you!
Have you already redeemed your prize for a great prize? <cf>Please accept the gifts, adventurers!
Hahaha!　It's a festival! <cf>I hope you adventurers enjoy yourselves as much as possible!
And be sure to wear a nice outfit too! <cf>It will be a winter memory to cherish!
Make a beautiful wish on the holy night! <cf>May they all come true together!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers!　The Merry Red of the Holy Night is at <cf>You can bring me as much as you want!
Let's also wear costumes appropriate for the Holy Night! <cf>It would be great if we could all get together to celebrate the festivities!
Don't forget to exchange your prize for a gorgeous prize! <cf>It's a great gift!　Hahaha!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of "Welcoming Spring and Flowers"?
New beginnings!　New challenges!　A new me! <cf>Let's have a festive celebration bloom!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband focused on "welcoming spring and flowers.
A lucky charm to celebrate new beginnings in a distant foreign land. <cf>It is a flower of red and festive hues!
They are displayed everywhere <cf>from the doorway to the dishes and the boxes filled with food!
It seems that these have washed up on the Magna continent. <cf>The King Collector wants to collect them!
If we decorate the city with many "welcoming [spring][flowers]", <cf>everyone will be in a happy mood!
Sometimes, the master's congratulations come in handy. <cf>We hope that adventurers will also send "Welcome [spring][welcome][flower]" to you!
It is said that when looking for "welcoming [spring][flowers]", the first thing to do is to hunt for uribo <cf>to liven things up!
The "welcoming spring flowers" are vivid and beautiful, you know! <cf>Excited Uribo gnaws on them and destroys them.
Maybe it's the wisdom of our ancestors to start with defeating Uribo <cf>
Can you go to <cf>and take down 5 Uribos in "Skyquake Fields"?
It's time to start collecting "Welcome Flowers"! <cf>Let's go with a bang like the new us, hahaha!
When collecting "spring flowers," <cf>we usually start by defeating Uribo.
We don't want the ulibis to swallow or <cf>destroy the "welcoming [spring][flower]"!
Come back here when you're done. <cf>Come on, let the festivities begin!　Hahaha!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>Defeating Uribo, it was a perfect decision!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>It is a great accomplishment to boost your business!
Then, let's start collecting "welcoming [spring] flowers"!
In fact, the person who collects the most "[spring][welcome][flower]" <cf>is respected as a good omen!
I heard that there is also a name for this, "Haruukinokuni-kun." <cf>There is no way my husband would have kept quiet when he found out about it.
Hahaha!　I'm definitely going to be the "Spring Caller" <cf>I'm so excited!　Congrats on the name!
Yes, it's a total blessing. <cf>Please join us, adventurers!
Of course, the collected "Welcome [Spring][Flower]" will be exchanged for the <cf>gorgeous prizes!
It's the only time to enjoy it! <cf>Let's enjoy the festive season, adventurers!
The more you collect, the more <cf>adventurers will get a great chance to win!
Please join my husband on his road trip to <cf>and win one of the gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>Have you gathered the "Welcoming Flowers of Spring"?
It's like all kinds of monsters are interested in <cf>taking it with them.
If you take down the Uribo, Skyfish, and Horngoats, <cf>you should be able to get more and more of them together!
The more you collect, the more you get in exchange for a great prize! <cf>Feel free to take it, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>The "Welcoming Flowers" are coming in nicely!
The more I look at it, the more I congratulate you! <cf>The more I see, the more celebratory I feel.
New beginnings, new challenges, new boku: ......
<span size="Big">Congratulations!　And beautiful! &lt;/&gt;
It is the partner who is to be congratulated. <cf>It is so. Mr. Adventurer.
However, it's not hard to understand why people are so <cf>excited by the bright colors of "welcoming [spring][flowers]"!
The exotic scene of this being displayed in the city must be very tasteful at <cf>
Hahaha!　The King Collector's desire to collect <cf>is getting a little too much!
There is also the honor of <cf>"Haruki-no-kun", which is given to the person who collects the most "[haru][welcome][hana]"!
My husband wants to be a "spring caller" from morning till night!　 <cf>
But then...an unexpected competitor appeared!　Then an unexpected rival showed up at <cf>!
Its name is [--] <span size="Big">Skyfish! &lt;/&gt;
Skyfish appearing in the "Minster Hills" are said to be swallowing <cf>"[spring][welcome][flower]" from one side to the other.
At this rate, Skyfish is going to be the biggest collector of [spring][welcome][flower] at <cf>!
The "King Collector" is also <cf>having a hard time wrapping his head around the emergence of a powerful competitor!
No matter how much you like it, Skyfish will never be called <cf>"You, Spring Caller," but ......
It seems that the master cannot allow <cf>him to fall behind in the area of those who have collected the most!
Hahaha!　For the sake of Mr. "King Collector" <cf>I wonder if you could help me, Mr. Adventurer?
I need you to go and take down five Skyfish in the "Minster Hills," <cf>!
Even if we put aside my husband's selfishness, we must not endanger those who collect "[spring][welcome][flower]" at <cf>!
Please help us adventurers at <cf>Thank you very much for your help~!
We don't want Skyfish to collect "Haru"[spring][welcome][flower] <cf>and become "Haru-kinobu no Kimi".
In order to collect "[spring][welcome][flower]" safely and securely, <cf>please, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Thank you for defeating Skyfish!
Thanks to your adventurer, <cf>"King Collector" seems to be relieved.
Now you don't have to worry about being told what to do with <cf>every time you see each other!
I would like to thank the adventurers again~!
The "Spring Calling You" brings good fortune and <cf>respect as a man of good fortune.
They were invited as [guests of honor] to various occasions, and <cf>sometimes some of them rose to positions of power.
My husband doesn't seem to be interested in such things at all <cf>
Hahaha!　The "King Collector" is a <cf>genuine Collector!
If it's the fact that you've 'collected the most,' <cf>he said, you don't need anything else.
I can't tell if you're selfless or greedy!
The collected "[spring][welcome][flower]" will be distributed to everyone in the town at <cf>
The festive colors celebrate new beginnings and new beginnings. <cf>See how well received it is!
Aside from my husband's greed and desire for honor, <cf>Adventurers have also received a thank you!
Of course, we have not skipped out on the gorgeous prizes! <cf>Please feel free to exchange your items!
Hahaha!　We are still accepting applications for "Welcome [Spring][Flower]"!
Defeat the target monsters and collect more and more! <cf>I'm always waiting for you, haha!
Hahaha!　Hey, adventurer! <cf>How are you doing with your "Spring Welcome Flowers" collection?
The target monsters are in various places. <cf>Please try to defeat them more and more!
The more you collect "Welcome [Spring][Flower]", the more you can exchange <cf>for gorgeous prizes!　Congratulations!
Let's have fun and celebrate <cf>something new for adventurers too!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for collecting "Welcome [spring][flower]"!
The more you look at it, the more vivid and beautiful it is! <cf>And it's a flower that makes me feel like celebrating!
The colors of "welcoming spring" are unique to this time of year. <cf>Soon they will fade away ephemerally.
Looking forward to a new beginning without leaving the old one behind. <cf>Maybe that's what it means.
<span size="Big">I'm impressed! &lt;/&gt;
What a beautiful and heartbreaking story! <cf>I can't believe that such feelings reside in each fragile flower!
It's hard to stop attracting the hearts and minds of monsters! <cf>Don't you think so?　Mr. Adventurer!
Sorry for rambling on, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I have been having trouble with "welcoming spring flowers".
The horngoats of Divine Haven Hill are said to be carrying away <cf>the [spring][welcome][flower]!
I heard that they decorate their beds with "welcoming flowers in spring. <cf>If that were all, it would be quaint.
I've been told that people are taking <cf>things that are decorated in the city or that people have collected.
We cannot overlook the fact that people are being harmed <cf>because of "welcoming [spring][flowers]"!
Would you be willing to take down <cf>about 10 Horngoats in "Divine Haven Hill"?
Once we get rid of the Horngoats, <cf>everyone can relax and celebrate!
I don't want them to be "You, the Spring Caller". <cf>Best regards, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Can you please go to <cf>and take down 10 Horngoats from "Divine Haven Hill"?
I understand the feeling of being attracted to the beauty of "welcoming [spring] flowers. <cf>However, it is not good to harm others, is it?
I just need you to chastise them a little and get rid of them! <cf>Nice to meet you, haha!
Hahaha!　Thanks, adventurer! <cf>The Horngoat's damage is gone!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>Everyone in town and my husband are relieved and relieved~!
The "Spring Greeting Flowers" are coming in nicely, and <cf>looks like it will be a smooth transition.
Hahaha!　I guess "King Collector" can be <cf>the "Spring Caller" he's always wanted to be!
Hmmm...but it was the adventurers who collected the most <cf>of "[spring][welcome][flower]", wasn't it?
I think it would be good for the adventurers to be "You, the Spring Caller" as well <cf>!
Well, for Warren, <cf>you have a point of view!
The "Spring Caller" is the one who calls for a new spring. <cf>He who gathers flowers and shares their bounty with others.
My husband is indeed a gatherer, but <cf>it was Mr. Adventurer who shared his blessings with the people!
You are a wonderful "Spring Caller". <cf>Thank you again. Thank you very much.
Hahaha!　Congratulations "Spring Calling You" <cf>I don't care how many of you there are!
I hope you will enjoy this season by collecting more and more "[spring][welcome][flowers]" <cf>adventurers!
Luxury prizes are still available. <cf>Please do not hesitate to redeem them!
Please continue to collect "Welcome [spring][flowers]" and bring them to <cf>!
The festive season is still going on! <cf>We are still looking for "Welcome [Spring][Flower]"!
Let's celebrate <cf>a happy new spring by exchanging your dosh for gorgeous prizes!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of the "Fairy Lentil Nectar"?
Send a honey and sweet treat to someone you care about as a token of your appreciation. <cf>
It's the beginning of a wonderful festive period! <cf>Adventurers, enjoy to your heart's content, hahaha!
This time, my husband's eyes were on the "nectar of the fairy lentil.
It is the nectar of a flower that opens at will like a fairy. <cf>It is sweet, fragrant, and heavenly in taste.
It is also called "phantom honey" <cf>which can only be enjoyed at this time of the year!
Hahaha!　With a phantom, there's no way the "King Collector" wouldn't be interested in <cf>, right?
I've decided to give away sweet treats made with generous amounts of this <cf>to everyone in town!
But the fairy lentil flowers have spikes <cf>that get caught on the monster's body!
Rumble boas in particular are large and often carry <cf>flowers away!
Moreover, they like "fairy lotus honey" <cf>, and if left alone, they eat more and more of it!
In order to get the "Fairy Lentil Nectar" <cf>, you need to defeat the Rumblebores!
Could you please go to <cf>and take out about 5 Rumblebores in the "Minster Hills"?
I need "Fairy Lentil Nectar" for everyone! <cf>I'm counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Can you please go to <cf>and take down 5 Rumblebores in the "Minster Hills"?
That big body will have a lot of fairy lentils <cf>stuck in it!
It looks like it's going to eat "Fairy Lentil Honey" too. <cf>Let's get rid of it while we can!　I'm asking for it!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>You got rid of the rumblebores.
Just as I thought, I found a lot of <cf>fairy lentil flowers trapped in the rumblebores' body hairs!
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts, adventurer! <cf>I also got the "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
So, let's get started on the pastry <cf>!
Hahaha!　Actually, it's the festive season of giving sweets to those who have helped me <cf>as a token of my gratitude!
The "King Collector" also wanted to give away <cf>candy to everyone in town!
We use a lot of rare "fairy lotus nectar" <cf>for our special sweets only available at this time of the year!
I would like to thank everyone at <cf>in Asterleeds for all their help and support in my daily collection activities!
I am trying my best in my own way to thank <cf>him at least for his kindness!
Well, I can't deny that I have a somewhat personal desire to taste the "nectar of fairy lilies" ( <cf>), but...
Hahaha!　That's why I want adventurers to deliver lots of <cf>"Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
We have some great prizes for adventurers! <cf>Please exchange them for "Fairy Lentil Nectar" without hesitation!
Hahaha!　Hey, adventurer! <cf>How's the "nectar of fairy lilies" coming along?
Various monsters should drop them <cf>so the more you take down, the more you'll get!
Let's collect more and more and exchange them for gorgeous prizes! <cf>Enjoy the festival, adventurers, haha!
Hahaha!　Hey, adventurer! <cf>How's your "Fairy Lentil Nectar" collecting going?
Our baking is going well! <cf>The sweet aroma is filling the streets!
The rich flavor of "Fairy Lentil Nectar" goes well with <cf>any pastry!
Cookies, candies, macaroons and doughnuts. <cf>They have all been well received by everyone!
Hahaha!　Baking, kneading, stirring! <cf>I've been very busy, but I'm enjoying baking too!
But, according to the "King Collector," <cf>["]something is missing ......["]!
[I want to make one more effort to be the only one! <cf>[I want to be the only one!
[I want something playful, yet not too assertive, <cf>that will tickle the Collector's fancy.
I'm going to give you a fluffy order, so <cf>I've left it at the mansion for now.
If you're having trouble, get some interesting stories from folks in town at <cf>
In such cases, "Tenshoku Dandelion" can be used to make <cf>interesting snacks!
It's a material that produces beautiful colors, but <cf>they don't know what color it will be until it's finished!
Think of it like a raffle to pick a color: <cf>Or maybe it's more festive!
I think we can achieve the "King Collector's" request at <cf>with this kind of device.
Hahaha!　Could you please go to <cf>in "Minster Hills" and collect 10 "tumbled colored dandelions"?
In the meantime, we'll continue with the baking! <cf>We'll finish them up as soon as the adventurers return!
I need you to go to "Minster Hills" and pick up 10 "Rolling Color Dandelions" <cf>!
If you combine it with the sweets of "Fairy Lentil Nectar", <cf>you will be able to create a unique and wonderful coloring!
I'll be waiting for you as you proceed with your pastry making! <cf>Oops, I'll have to check on the oven!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thanks, adventurer! <cf>That's a beautiful "tumbling colored dandelion"!
The colors are colorful and brilliant! <cf>You are indeed an adventurer!　I thank you~!
Now you will have a blooming field of colorful sweets! <cf>Yes, just like a flower garden of sweets!
<span size="Big">A flower garden of sweets!　Sounds lovely! &lt;/&gt;
I feel a <cf>tingling in my chest, like when I stare at myself in the mirror!
I don't care if I have to tear it open or not!
Hahaha!　This crush <cf>can't even stop me myself!
Come on, adventurer!　Sorry to keep you waiting! <cf>It's time for "Fairy Lentil Nectar" and "Rolling Color Dandelion!
I'm sure there will be a colorful flower garden of sweets all over <cf>the city!
Even a flowery partner has something good to say once in a while. <cf>I think you will all be pleased.
Adventurers, please continue to collect <cf>"Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
We will still be making snacks, and <cf>we still have more gorgeous prizes to give away!
You can never have too much of the "Fairy Lentil Nectar"! <cf>The more you have, the more smiles you will bring to everyone's face!
Keep collecting and delivering them to us! <cf>We'll be waiting for you as long as you want, hahaha!
Hahaha!　The "Fairy Lentil Honey" snacks are <cf>very popular thanks to you!
Everyone seems to be enjoying the colorful <cf>colors as well as the sweet flavors!
Thanks to the adventurers, I guess! <cf>Come on, I'm still waiting for "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
The more you collect, the more prizes you get! <cf>Have fun, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Thanks again for the "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
Thanks to you, our sweets are a big hit! <cf>People are so happy with them, they are even thanking us for them!
The "Fairy Lentil Nectar" is sweet and delicious, and it's fun to see the colors change in <cf>"Tarnished Dandelion"!
Adventurers have collected <cf>and it has brought smiles to everyone's faces!
My husband, the "King Collector," also sends his thanks to <cf>for your kind attention!
Since we're here, we decided that this time the whole town should join us <cf>and enjoy making sweets!
We're going to need a lot of materials, so I went to <cf>Larpal's farm to ask for some.
Then I heard a troubling story!
The Kaiser Elk have been tearing up the farm and <cf>crops and dairy cows have been damaged!
We also received many ingredients for our sweets from <cf>, and we would like to express our gratitude to all those who helped us.
What thanks can we show for <cf>without helping the farmers here?
Hahaha!　I'm on fire and so is Carnella! <cf>We need your help, adventurers!
Could you please take down 7 Kaiser Elks from "Divine Haven Hill", <cf>?
In the meantime, we'll build a fence or something <cf>to keep them off the farm!
Even if we can't fight the monsters, <cf>we are willing to help where we can!
Please help us defeat the Kaiser Elk at <cf>for the good of the farmers!
We need to keep the Kaiser elk that are destroying the plantation <cf>away from us!
We are also indebted to <cf>for the ingredients for our sweets and other things!
Go to "Divine Haven Hill" and take down 7 Kaiser Elks, <cf>!
In the meantime, we'll do our best to build a fence and so on! <cf>We're counting on you, adventurer!　Ha-ha-ha!
Hahaha!　Thanks, adventurer! <cf>I got rid of the Kaiser Elk without incident!
Thank you for your cooperation, adventurers! <cf>Thanks to you, peace has returned to everyone on the plantation!
We have also taken measures to prevent the monsters from bothering us <cf>!
We also received a lot of ingredients for sweets again! <cf>Let's make more and more of them to show our gratitude!
But Carnella. Did we really send our thanks to <cf>all of you?
Oh, Warren. What a coincidence. <cf>I, too, feel like I'm forgetting someone important.
Hahaha!　I knew Carnella would understand! <cf>She is the one to whom we should definitely deliver our special treats!
<span size="Big">That's Mr. Adventurer! &lt;/&gt;
We are also indebted to many people, <cf>but we are more interested in adventurers.
When it comes to expressing our gratitude, we can't leave out <cf>adventurers!
Hahaha!　So for the adventurers <cf>we all made a special decorated cake!
The "Fairy Lentil Nectar" and "Dandelion" were added in abundance! <cf>We made it sweet and colorful!
With our full of gratitude! <cf>Take it!　Hahaha!
I am able to enjoy baking in this way thanks to <cf>adventurers!
Of course, there are still many more "fairy lotus nectars" <cf>to collect and please bring them with you!
We will continue to accept exchange for luxury prizes!
Hahaha!　The festivities are still going on, you know! <cf>I hope it will be a wonderful memory for you adventurers!
The "Fairy Lentil Nectar," the special sweets, and the gorgeous prizes are all special only for this time of year. <cf>
Gather up your "Fairy Lentil Nectar" and have a <cf>happy time!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　The "Fairy Lentil Nectar" is at <cf>We're still accepting applications!
Various monsters seem to have them. <cf>I hope that you will continue to defeat them and collect as many as you can!
Gorgeous prizes await you adventurers! <cf>Make some sweet and wonderful memories, haha!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Do you know "The Old Paper of Maigurat"?
Asterleeds is in full swing with the Port Opening Festival! <cf>We can't afford to lose!
We'll provide a fun event for everyone! <cf>And I need your help to make it happen!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband's focus was on old paper from the Maigurat.
This paper was mass-produced hundreds of years ago and is <cf>characterized by its old-fashioned coloring!
If you draw a treasure map or something similar, <cf>it will be a perfect fit!
Yes!　It would be fun to do a treasure hunt on <cf>using the map from "The Old Papers of Maigurat"!
Asterleeds is in the midst of the Port Opening Festival! <cf>My husband wanted to do something to add to the festivities.
We have a warehouse full of piles of goods, and <cf>thought this would be a good opportunity to give them away to the people of the city.
Hahaha!　Carnella's idea came up with <cf>We all agreed to go on a treasure hunt together!
If I'm going to do this, I'm going to be particular about the treasure map! <cf>The "Maigurat's Old Paper" is a perfect match!
However!　It seems that during the transport, the "Mygrat's old paper" got scattered <cf>into pieces!
The packing box broke and the <cf>waste paper flew away in the strong wind!
We have to go around and collect them, but before we do that, <cf>we have to take measures to prevent them from dissipating again.
Hahaha!　So, I want adventurers to find <cf>"Dead Heavy Stone"!
The stone is known for its weight and size! <cf>If you use this as a weight stone, it will be perfect!
I think five of them would hold "My Grat's Old Paper" <cf>firmly in place.
You'll find it in the Skyquake Fields. <cf>I asked for "Dead Heavy Stone", haha!
I need you to go to "Skyquake Fields" and collect <cf>5 "Dead Heavy Stones"!
With that, I'll be able to find "My Grat Old Paper" at <cf>!
Hahaha! <cf>Adventurer, I'm counting on you to take care of me!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>So this is the "Dead Heavy Stone"!
Haha ...... <span size="Big">It's really heavy! &lt;/&gt;
It is enough for a heavy stone, isn't it? <cf>Thank you, adventurer.
However, if we don't collect the important "old paper of Maigurat" <cf>there is no place to put the stone!
So, until the "Maigrat's Old Paper" is collected, <cf>Warren will keep it.
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I can't wait for you to collect the "Maigrat's Old Paper"!
I can't wait until my arms are at their limit! <cf>They're already getting pretty stiff!
If your arms don't work, put them on your knees. <cf>If you sit on your knees, you will be more stable.
Oh, here's a <cf>jagged board that looks comfortable.
Hahaha!　I think I'm going to work a little harder! <cf>My arm muscles are suddenly full of motivation!
So, adventurers. Please collect <cf>"Maigurat's Old Paper" at your own pace!
According to eyewitnesses, it looks like the scattered "Mygrat old papers" are being picked up by <cf>monsters!
Some of them use paper, others eat it. <cf>Either way, it's not going to be usable.
It is not a very strong paper to begin with. <cf>It will be torn and scattered after the Port Opening Festival.
This is the only time of the year to enjoy this event, including the treasure hunt! <cf>Please collect as many as you can and exchange them for gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　You adventurers are one step ahead of us. <cf>You've got the treasure!
Keep collecting "Maigrat's Old Paper" and <cf>take the gorgeous prizes!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurers! <cf>We've been collecting "Maigrat's Old Paper" just fine!
It's a relief to have a place to put my weight! <cf>It wouldn't have been so bad if I'd just kept it.
What do you think?　My beautiful muscles are even more polished! <cf>Come on, adventurers, take a closer look!
If you give me a "Dead Heavy Stone" to the brain <cf>I don't see anything, do you?　Adventurer...
I hope you will turn a blind eye to <cf>when I pay you an additional visit!
Hahaha!　But there's something about "Maigrat's Old Paper" <cf>that I can't close my eyes to!
Happi Happi Uribo!　Happy name <cf>They've got some trouble on their hands!
In fact, a monster called "Happi Happi Uribo" likes to eat <cf>"Mygrat's Old Paper"!
The food has even affected the [biological] engrams, and <cf>even changed the shape of the normal ulibo.
If he eats it at that rate, it could interfere with the "King Collector's" <cf>treasure hunt event!
If the "Maigrat's Old Paper" gets eaten up <cf>your plans to make the Port Opening Festival a great success will be ruined!
Before that happens, I'd like you to take down "Happi Happi Uribo" and <cf>get rid of him!
I think if you take down 10 of them, <cf>they'll go quiet for a while!
Please take down 10 "Happi Happi Uribo" from "Minster [Hills]" at <cf>!
Of course, you can use the "old paper of Maigurat" that you got as an achievement of <cf>adventurers!
I need you to go and take down 10 "Happi Happi Uribo" from "Minster Hills" <cf>
They seem to love "Maigurat's old paper. <cf>If we don't let them go, they'll eat more and more of it.
I don't want to get in the way of the adventurers! <cf>I want to get rid of them while I can, haha!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I guess we're done defeating "Happi-Happi-Uribo!
Well done as always, adventurer! <cf>Thank you from me as well!
This will also help <cf>to reduce the damage of eating "Maigurat's old paper"!
But why does "Happi Happi Uribo" want to eat <cf>"Maigrat's Old Paper"?
Is it delicious? <cf>Do you enjoy the dazzling ancient flavors?
Hahaha!　I'm starting to get interested in this! <cf>I think I'm going to become a "Happi-Happi-Varen" too!
Even if you don't eat, you are <cf>a happy-go-lucky head every day!
Really?　I'm kind of embarrassed, haha!
The "old paper of Maigrat" was reportedly a commodity produced in large quantities in the old capital of Maigrat <cf>
Although it is an artifact from an older time, it is not <cf>a precious or rare item!
I have a pile of them in the warehouse of the "King Collector" <cf>and I'm going to use them for a treasure hunt event.
It's like the paper that everyone used <cf>as a matter of course in the ancient city of Maigrat.
In other words, there's going to be a lot more used paper for the adventurers to collect <cf>!
They are scattered all over the place and there appear to be some <cf>examples taken away by monsters. We must continue to recover them.
Please join us, adventurers! <cf>We will continue to offer great prizes!
Calling all "Maigrat's Old Papers"! <cf>Adventurers, please aim to get the treasure, too, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you very much for collecting "Maigrat's Old Paper."
It seems that "Happi Happi Uribo" sometimes has a lot of "My Grat's Old Paper" <cf>
We don't want them eaten, so if you see them, please take them down! <cf>Bring me more and more!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Are you enjoying the opening festivities in Asterleeds?
I'd like you to collect "Maigrat's Old Paper," but <cf>you shouldn't go through with your festival!
There are so many people here, and the vibrancy is amazing! <cf>I think the Arena and other places are also very lively!
Yes, Arena!　A beautiful, blood-boiling garden of battle! <cf>Arena is surely waiting for you!
Why don't you just ask <cf>frankly, instead of making a bunch of poorly written advertising claims?
The Arena prize is "Maigrat's Old Paper", so I'm wondering if you'd be willing to take the <cf>challenge and collect it?　Hahaha!
You should have said so from the beginning. <cf>My apologies, Mr. Adventurer.
In fact, it seems that "Maigrat's Old Paper" has been <cf>[mixed up] in the Arena prizes!
Asterleeds is in the midst of the Port Opening Festival! <cf>Even the shipping companies are having a hard time keeping up.
It's like the "Maigrat's Old Paper" arrived at <cf>Arena by mistake!
I'd sort it out, but the Arena is an Arena <cf>and it's a big, crowded, festive place.
I think the only way this is going to happen is if we get the prize fair and square <cf>I don't think there is any other way!
If you let your partner do it, instead of waste paper, you will only get <cf>rags back!
Everyone is enjoying themselves at the Port Opening Festival. <cf>I wonder if it would be a good idea to go out of your way to add more flammable trash.
Hahaha!　No, Carnella! <cf>The "Maigrat's Old Paper" isn't garbage!
So I'm asking adventurers to collect the Arena's <cf>"Maigrat's Old Paper"!
Complete the "Rush Battle, First Level" and get the <cf>prize!
I'm sure you'll be fine, if you're up to it! <cf>I'm cheering for you from here, hahaha!
I need you to complete "Rush Battle, First Level" to win a prize from <cf>Arena!
It seems that "Maigurat's old paper" got mixed up. <cf>Only the winners can collect it.
You'll be fine, adventurer! <cf>We're rooting for you, so good luck!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Good job, adventurer! <cf>You won the "Rush Battle"!
I was able to collect "Maigrat's Old Paper" and the people at <cf>Arena thanked me for it!
Because if others got this as a prize, they'd just <cf>be in trouble.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>We have collected a lot of "Maigurat's Old Papers".
The King Collector is getting ready to start his treasure hunt at <cf>
I was thinking we should start making a treasure map too.
Hahaha!　It would be great if the Port Opening Festival could be more <cf>exciting!
Thanks to the adventurers for collecting the "Maigrat's Old Paper" at <cf>!　Hahaha!
By the way, I heard that "The Old Paper of Maigrat" has a legend about the <cf>port!
At the sailing, they sprinkled colorful pieces of paper <cf>toward the sea!
The ceremony was held to see off the sailors and to pray for their safe journey. <cf>It is said that the custom was filled with such meanings.
Hahaha!　Nice! <cf>It's perfect for the opening festivities in Asterleeds!
When the treasure hunt is over, let's all try to imitate each other!
You'll see confetti as beautiful as mine! <cf>Confetti as beautiful as mine!
Did you say you wanted to disappear like confetti into the sea?
Hahaha!　The ocean belongs to everyone! <cf>We have to make sure we don't pollute it!
Come on, the Port Opening Festival is still going on! <cf>I hope you'll still be collecting "Maigrat's Old Papers" too!
We have a variety of gorgeous prizes for you to choose from! <cf>Fun only for adventurers!
Please continue to bring your "My Grat's Old Paper"! <cf>Please enjoy the exchange until the very end~!
Hahaha!　The collection of <cf>"Maigrat's Old Paper" is still going on until the end of the Opening Port Festival!
Don't miss out on any of the great prizes we have to thank you for! <cf>You can trade them all in if you like!
Enjoy the Port Opening Festival till the end!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of "gold dust sap"?
Culture that boys get hooked on at least once! <cf>It is insect collecting!
I'd like to use the "gold dust sap" to get the ball rolling! <cf>I'd like your help if you'd like!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband's focus was on "gold dust sap.
There's a boom in insect collecting among the kids in Asterleeds right now <cf>
The biggest of them all, and the one that everyone is after! <cf>The favorite food of the "King of Gold Helmet" is "gold dust sap!
This story inspired the "King Collector" to make a fuss about getting <cf>the "King of Golden Helmets" by any means necessary.
We started by collecting "gold dust sap" <cf>!
In fact, I have my kids collect <cf>"gold dust sap" while collecting insects!
Everyone wanted to see "The King of Golden Helmet". <cf>It was a joint operation with the "King Collector," as it turns out!
However, "gold dust sap" is also a favorite of animals. <cf>Monsters may come nearby.
We cannot let our children be in danger. <cf>Can we ask for the help of adventurers?
Hahaha!　First of all, I want you to take down the <cf>rivos in "Minster [Hills (Kyuryo)]" and get rid of them!
That way, the children will be able to collect <cf>"gold dust sap" safely!
I'm counting on you, adventurer!　The road to the "King of the Golden Helmet" <cf>rests on your shoulders!　Hahaha!
I need you to take out 5 "Uribos" in "Minster [Hills]" <cf>and get rid of them!
It would be a disaster if the kids collect insects or "gold dust sap" and run into <cf>monsters!
Let's make sure everyone understands that the adventurers are watching over us <cf>!　I'm asking for it, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Good job on defeating Uribo, huh?
Thank you!　And congratulations! <cf>You are now an agent of the world!
What?　What are you talking about?　Hahaha! <cf>Well then, let me explain it to you from the beginning!
[--]Actually, there's a group of people <cf>hiding behind the insect-collecting boom who are doing dark things.
Its name is "Insector Force"! <cf>It is an evil organization that manipulates insects and plans to take over the world!
Stop their ambitions and protect the world! <cf>The trump card to achieve this is the "King of Golden Helmet"!
To revive the "King of the Golden Helmet," we need "gold dust sap! <cf>It is the agent's mission to collect it!
Come on, I'm asking you!　Defeat the "Insector Force" and <cf>protect the world together with you!　Hahaha!
The idea is to let children enjoy collecting "gold dust sap" <cf>in a setting such as [--]!
Hahaha!　What do you think? <cf>I was up all night thinking about it!　Isn't this a hot story?
Surprisingly, there are a lot of people who get into it! <cf>Boys like this kind of thing, after all!
Of course, girls are welcome! <cf>It's best for everyone to have fun together, haha!
Whatever you do, please bring your "gold dust sap" with you! <cf>We have many gorgeous prizes for you!
Enjoy the fun of this season only! <cf>Please enjoy collecting "gold dust sap"!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>The "Golden Sap" is gathering rapidly!
The "Insector Force" story seems to be getting a lot of traction. <cf>People are collecting a lot of them!
Hahaha!　It feels good to see that everyone's into the <cf>story I made up!
What evil organization are you speaking of?
If we are an evil organization, that would make the "King Collector" the head of <cf>evil, wouldn't it?
I see, that makes sense. <cf>For once, Warren has taken one for the team.
Hahaha!　Such is the heat of the "King Collector" <cf>It hasn't cooled off yet!
More for "Golden Powder Sap"! <cf>More for "King of the Golden Helmet"!
If greed is evil, the master is the very embodiment of it. <cf>His greed and desire to collect knows no bounds.
So, I thought I'd expand the scope of "golden sap" collection a little <cf>
I looked up "Andra Basin" at <cf>and I'm having a bit of a problem with it.
The rumblebores are going to eat the "golden sap"! <cf>It would be a disaster if people who went to collect it met up with them!
Adventurers, could you please take down <cf>about 10 rumblebores in "Andra Basin"?
If we get rid of them now, <cf>we can deal with the rest!
For the safety of the "Golden Sap" collection, we ask for the help of <cf>adventurers!
Can you take out 10 "Rumblebores" in "Andra Basin" <cf>and get rid of them?
They know what "golden sap" tastes like, and they're gathering around. <cf>They want to stay away from it while they still can.
It would be a disaster if we all ran into each other. <cf>Best regards, Mr. Adventurer!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for defeating Rumblebore!
This will make it easier to find <cf>"gold dust sap" in "Andra Basin"!
Oh, and of course the kids are with the adults. <cf>I've already told them that well enough!
Everyone has been looking for "gold dust sap" at <cf>in various places, and we have been collecting it steadily!
I hear it's been good for insect collecting.
Hahaha!　That's right! <cf>Some kid caught a rare bug from "Andra Basin."
He became very popular and made a lot of friends! <cf>This is one of the great things about insect collecting, isn't it?
Of course, the kid got the bug because of the <cf>adventurer's efforts!
It is a pleasure to expand the circle of <cf>people through the collection of "gold dust sap" and insects!
My husband's desire for things may be useful sometimes!
Now, now, please satisfy such a master's unfathomable desire with <cf>"Golden Sap" to the fullest!
There are still many more prizes to be awarded! <cf>Please collect them and exchange them as many times as you like!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Great news to shake up the insect collecting craze!
I might finally be able to catch the "King of Golden Helmets" <cf>!
Insect collectors are always on the lookout for <cf>golden bugs!
As I have already mentioned, our master "King Collector" also wants <cf>!
I was diligently applying large amounts of "gold dust sap" to the trees and waiting for the "King of Gold Helmet" <cf>to appear.
What a surprise!　The area where the "gold dust sap" was applied <cf>ate up the entire bark!
No ordinary insect could have done this! <cf>The "King of Golden Helmets" must have come along!
So I created a new version of the same trick, but <cf>another problem arose!
This time it's Miin who's in the way! <cf>The same insect is a dangerous monster, Aitsurasa!
Miin took the "gold dust sap" that I had painted on <cf>one after another and ate it up.
This is not going to bring the "King of the Golden Helmet" to us! <cf>He has to get rid of Miin!
Miin from "Ritze Tradeway" are devouring the "gold dust sap" that we planted <cf>
There are so many that we haven't gotten around to it. <cf>Can you please take down 20 of them?
One step closer to the "King of Golden Helmets"! <cf>Everyone wants to see the king of the phantom insects too!
Please do me a favor, adventurer! <cf>Get rid of Miin and grant everyone's wishes!
I need you to take down 20 "Miins" from the "Ritze Tradeway" <cf>!
If they devour any more of the "gold dust sap" <cf>I won't be able to stand it!
To capture the "King of Golden Helmets" with my own hands! <cf>I entrusted everyone's dreams to you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thanks for taking down Miin! <cf>Thanks to the adventurers, I was able to fix the trick!
From now on, "King Kim Kabuto" should come to <cf>to eat "gold dust sap"!
If we can catch them there, our dream will come true!
Thank you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>My husband sends his thanks as well.
We are one step closer to becoming the "King of Golden Helmets. <cf>It seems that everyone is looking forward to it!
This is going to be the climax of the insect collecting boom! <cf>I'll have to keep an eye on it!
We will continue to welcome "Gold Powder Sap". <cf>Please feel free to exchange it for our gorgeous prizes!
My husband. If he catches one "King of the Golden Helmet", he is bound to say <cf>["]I want a mate["]!
Hahaha!　That's right! <cf>There is no way the "King Collector" would be satisfied with just one fish!
We're going to need a lot more gold dust sap!
Our insect collecting never ends! <cf>Come on, adventurers, let's have fun together!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Do you still have the gold dust sap on hand?
Don't forget to redeem your prize for a great prize! <cf>You can bring more and more!
Let's enjoy the insect collecting boom to the end! <cf>'Gold dust sap', I'll be waiting!　Hahaha!
Well, it's a very crowded place! <cf>It's the opening ceremony of the port of Asterleeds!
It's the biggest festival in Asterleeds. <cf>It's the biggest festival in Asterleaze, and it's as big as the Bapharian Star Festival!
The area around the harbor is decorated and <cf>crowded with people. There are stalls.
How are you enjoying yourself?
Well, well, it's important to take a break.
But you're an adventurer too, <cf>and you can't keep playing around!
You remember what we're here for, don't you? <cf>I told you at the beginning.
The first thing we have to get. That is...
<span size="Big">Money! &lt;/&gt;
Wherever people gather, information gathers. <cf>It's also important to catch up on gossip, you know?
From the looks of it, you still don't know. <cf>I have no choice but to tell you a "good story".
Between you and me?　There is a treasure in the Reikrid Tunnels that no one has ever seen. <cf>
Who would have thought there would be a treasure in such close proximity? <cf>That's why it's a pit!
This, this, this, don't show your face. <cf>Don't let anyone beat you to it.
Only when you outrun the competition, <cf>the pleasure of getting the treasure will be enhanced!　Hmmm...
(Maybe that's how "Cliffside Ruins" did it: ......)
Now, there's no time to dilly-dally. <cf>Let's set out for the Reikrid Tunnels!
It's good to go out and earn money with me once in a while. <cf>Wait for me, treasure you haven't seen yet!
Let's go to the Reikrid Tunnels, my servant! <cf>Rumor has it there are treasures yet to be discovered.
You know, <cf>, it's the secret of successful people to be the first to get wind of this kind of gossip.
You have a long way to go. <cf>You can learn from me!
Well, well, well, here we are. <cf>No one else seems to be after the treasure.
Good, good, good. We'll be the first to go!
But it's a strange feeling. <cf>It's been a long time since I've been here, or not so long.
It also reminds me of <cf>that I suddenly had to fight an ogre.
I'm sure you'll have an easy time. <cf>I'll follow along comfortably.
Don't worry, I won't skip it. <cf>I'm not going to miss out on any treasures!
Now, to get the treasure you haven't seen yet! <cf>Let's go, servant!
Well, thank you!　The Reikrid Tunnels are a piece of cake for me and you at <cf>!
Now, the key treasure is ......!
It's "Lake Crystal" as usual: ......
What a never-before-seen treasure! <cf>It's a gaseous story, isn't it?
I thought it was funny!　If you're looking for "Reikrid Tunnels", <cf>someone has already explored it!
If there's a treasure in that place, <cf>I'll go get it myself before I tell anyone else!
What a waste of time and money! <cf>Oh, I'm so angry!　I'm so angry!
......?　I think you're wasting your time. <cf>Well, I may have overstepped the mark. ......
What is it? I hope you're not going to say something like, "[]Having adventures with me was the greatest treasure["]" or <cf>something like that, are you?
<span size="Big">What? &lt;/&gt; What are you doing?
That's what I'm talking about! <cf>That's what I'm talking about!
Oh, yes, I'm going to get burned! <cf>Servant!　I will conquer the stalls, so go along with me!
Well, well, it's the first time I've walked with someone at the Port Opening Festival <cf>and it's fun too ......
Just go! <cf>You can't make money if you're hungry!
I'll have you back at <cf>tomorrow to make a lot of money.
After all, you are my <cf>best servant!
How are you enjoying the Port Opening Festival?
If a profitable offer comes along, <cf>tell me about it immediately!　Okay?
<span size="Big">Master and his Lord!　Scold me! &lt;/&gt;
What's the matter with you? <cf>We have no taste for meaningless scolding!
It's the Opening Port Festival and ...... <cf>I'm chewing on my inadequacy. ......
Accepting charity from those you are supposed to protect is a disgrace to a knight! <cf>What kind of a pathetic man am I?
You're overreacting. I didn't just buy you a skewer from a food truck <cf>
Oh, Charlotte. <cf>I see you've come too.
Of course!　I always look forward to the Port Opening Festival. <cf>It's a big event in Asterleeds.
You can watch the stage, eat and walk around. <cf>I can forget all the bad stuff during the Port Opening Festival.
So Carvein, why don't you take it easy and enjoy it?
Charlotte is right. <cf>It's no use being so uptight all the time.
If I can get a treat, <cf>I'll conquer all the stalls right now!
I am not afraid to treat the master and his Lord. <cf>But ......
Now that I don't even have a wallet, it's a dream that can't come true: ......
Wallet?　I remember you said you had lost it. <cf>I think it was when we met in "Soundless City".
[--], you didn't go looking for it yet!
I've been so busy with things since then that I forgot about it. ......
So how have you been spending your time so far?
Accepted funding from Einlein!
<span size="Big">That's the point where you should scold me! &lt;/&gt;
But it's a good opportunity. <cf>Maybe this is the place to go to "Soundless City" to find a wallet.
Master, will you go out with me? <cf>It's been a while since I've fought side by side with my master.
Oh, then I want to go too!
Eh?　No, no, no, we're going to the ruins. <cf>It's not like a festival.
Waiting is boring. <cf>Then I want to go on an adventure with everyone!
If you say no, ...... <cf>pay me back for the skewers, right here, right now... ♪
Ggh!　Well, now that you mention it: ......
Why don't you take him with you? <cf>You're with me, and the servant is with you, so it should be fine.
It's more trouble than it's worth if they sneak up on you later. <cf>Charlotte could do something like that.
All right, I'll go with you. <cf>We're just gonna look for your wallet, so don't do anything rash.
I will protect you even if it costs me my life!
Isn't it unfair to say that right away? ......
Let's go to "Soundless City"! <cf>I know it's a disgrace, but I need to find my lost wallet.
It would be great if the master could come too. <cf>It has been a while since we have fought together and I am kind of looking forward to it!
I won't slow you down either, so please don't let me slow you down.
I'll show you that I haven't lost my skill with a bow!
The Soundless City. I miss it a little.
I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't met the masters here <cf>
I could have been killed by Avaritia just like that. <cf>After all, the master saved my life!
That was before I met him, right? <cf>Then you went to the desert and saved me, too.
Yes, yes. I've been swept away by a reckless <cf>diva who takes the bait herself.
Haha ...... Thanks for that section. <cf>But I'm not all protected anymore.
I can fight properly, too, so watch me!
I will protect Charlotte. <cf>Don't worry about your master.
Come on, let's go!　In search of my wallet!
<span size="Big">I couldn't find it: ......! &lt;/&gt;
Well, it was a long time ago. <cf>Maybe someone picked it up.
Or it could be in the belly of the monster. <cf>There's no way to know for sure.
[The lesson here is a heavy one: don't lose your wallet, but look for it. <cf>I hope what's inside was a learning experience.
I'm sorry, Charlotte. In the name of my knighthood, <cf>I will repay you for your hospitality!
I wish I didn't have to. I had a great <cf>adventure with Carvein and everyone and it was a lot of fun!
It was kind of festive over here.
But that doesn't stop me!
Really?　If you insist that much <cf>I'll let you hang out with me a little longer.
There's an interesting event at the harbor stage. <cf>It looks like street performers and divas will be there.
I'd love to go see it, but I'd be lonely alone.
That's a small price to pay! <cf>If it's okay with me, I'll go out with you as much as you want!
Hmm. Thanks.
Will you escort me then?　Sir Knight.
Noted!
Well then, Master and his Lord. <cf>Thank you very much!
Please let me fight with you again sometime. <cf>I had fun today too!
Have fun at the Port Opening Festival, you two! <cf>See you then!
By the way, Asterleeds' opening festival is <cf>really lively!
Shall I buy something for Einlein as well? <cf>...... No, I didn't have a wallet. ......
I'm so glad I never thought I'd get to go around Carvein and the Port Opening Festival <cf>
I hope you guys enjoy the Kaiko-Festival too. <cf>After all, a festival must be enjoyed by everyone!
Yeah. ......
That ...... festival, right?
Chi, you were wrong. So, food ......, then? <cf>Or maybe a nap .......
…………？？
...... What have you been up to, since a moment ago?
Oh, you two. We met you in a good place.
I just saw Mr. Einrain and <cf>called out to him!
There is something you want to say. <cf>I'm having trouble putting it ......
So you've been talking about <cf>this and that.
Hmm?　You mean us?
I need a little ...... help. <cf>The equipment in the Sanctuary of Blessings is not working. ......
That's a big deal, isn't it! <cf>I will be there as soon as I can!
Wait, wait, wait!　Don't run off on your own!
If you need our help, <cf>you must be in a lot of trouble.
There are still monsters in the area to be repaired. <cf>The congregation can't handle it and we're in trouble ......
That's why I've been waiting for ...... for you guys to come along.
Then why don't you just come and get me?
Oh, perhaps I should have invited you both to <cf>?
I can't believe I let God's hand [bother] me. ......
Please don't worry about that.
People join hands with each other in times of distress and trouble. <cf>There is no need for me to be reserved.
Just as well, Einrain. <cf>Let's go to the "Sanctuary of Blessings" with Aerinse.
Aerinse is the only one who can fix the device. <cf>Then you may as well come with us.
When you've been on adventures together, <cf>you can be a little less reserved.
......!　With God, an adventure. ......
It's settled. All right, my servant! <cf>I will bring them together!
It seems that the equipment of the "Sanctuary of Blessings" is malfunctioning. <cf>I think I can fix it, so let's go.
Hmm, it's a little different form <cf>but it's fun to think that I'm going out with you all!
With God ...... adventure ......!
From what I can see here, there doesn't seem to be any major anomalies.
But you'll need to go to <cf>in the back to find out more and deal with it.
I don't think it's going to be the same <cf>frenzy as it was when I first came here ......
The monster hasn't been as rampant as it was then.
But ...... doesn't seem to have gone completely quiet.
The avaritia shell may have caused the <cf>"[Sanctuary of Blessings]" itself to become unstable!
Well, there's no use in taking things too seriously. <cf>This time it's not a big trouble, is it?
Leave the servants to take care of the surroundings, you take care of Einlein <cf>
Understood. Well then, I look forward to working with you.
Thank you for your hard work. <cf>The device has been successfully repaired.
It was an easy process, but ...... <cf>I'm kind of a little disappointed.
It is unusual for you to say such a thing. <cf>I would think you would be glad that nothing happened.
I am sorry if this sounds inappropriate. <cf>I didn't mean it that way.
But every time I go on with Einrain and everyone else, <cf>I feel a little more uplifted. ......
I felt so grateful and wonderful <cf>to have people to support each other and continue on the path together!
When I entered the [Sanctuary of Blessings] <cf>before, I didn't have time to think about such things.
That ...... I, too, that ......
It was fun, I enjoyed it. With God, Adventures ......
Well, that's good to hear! <cf>I feel the same way.
It's the Port Opening Festival. <cf>Why don't you go and have fun, too, instead of just doing your miko work?
That's exactly why you should go have some fun with Aerinse.
The crowds are a bit ....... <cf>Besides, Lugerio would scold me.
I see. ....... <cf>So why not at least have a view of the harbor?
It would be sad to say goodbye like this.
I agree. If you just watch from afar, <cf>you won't even get hit by a bee.
......うん ......
Well, you can see it at ......!　It's beautiful.
Everyone seems to be having fun. Good.
Is God enjoying ...... too?
Yes, of course. <cf>I've never seen such a lovely sight!
Thanks to Mr. Einrain's assistance.
I'm such a ......
I'm glad you're happy with ......, too!
May Asterleeds have the blessings of <cf>Bapharia
From the Star Festival to the Port Opening Festival, people in this era enjoy <cf>many festivals!
I would love to show it to Tyris. <cf>It would be a real blessing if we could go around the festival together!
We need to learn how to enjoy the festival <cf>well for that time!
<span size="Big">Fishing is hot right now! &lt;/&gt;
The event is being held at a marina by the sea! <cf>Why don't you take this opportunity to enjoy fishing?
Both novice and expert anglers gather at the marina! <cf>Catch fish, catch fish, and get rewards!
Welcome, this is the venue for the fishing event! <cf>Fish to your heart's content!
You can also ask <cf>the people in town how to fish.
Like the old man there, <cf>or Mr. Andor by the "Mawaru Rudder Wheel Pavilion".
I'm sure you'll get the adventure board for the event at <cf>, so check back.
If you advance on the adventure board, you'll get <cf>all sorts of rewards!
Talk to other adventurers and have fun with <cf>everyone!
Asterlys Beach is <cf>super HOT right now!
You can also climb up on the yagura <cf>and dance to the groovy music.
Enjoy a different <cf>night view of Asterleeds or
Enjoy the special feeling of <cf>only now~~!
Hey!　Kimi! <cf>Have you been to Asterlys Beach?
Only now, they've decorated the beaches and ...... <cf>erected a yagura dotted in the ocean!
By the way, I recommend <cf>for the view from the top of the yagura!
You should definitely go!
Welcome. <cf>Welcome to the Two-Faced Coin Pavilion.
Did I surprise you? <cf>Actually, I decided to continue "Baito" a little longer!
It was depressing to sit still <cf>and do nothing while waiting to find Tyris ......
I talked to Jake and he said I could work here <cf>
I'll do my best <cf>not to break my plate this time!
So please treat me as Aerinse, the clerk here <cf>
Well then, sir. <cf>Please make yourselves at home.
I have always wanted to visit this restaurant <cf>once!
You can see the ocean and the wind in the air at ....... <cf>I always thought it was a lovely place.
Taking a break like this is really pleasant and ...... <cf>soothing to the mind and body!
I'd love to meet Tyris and all of you at <cf>and enjoy a cup of tea here!
Take a moment to look at the beautiful ocean at ....... <cf>I can't wait for a day like that!
Jake asked me to come to <cf>to find fish for the coin pavilion. ......
Whatever, you can get <cf>fish by fishing here.
I have never seen fishing before! <cf>It must be a lot of hard work to prepare a single fish!
I pledge to eat my fish clean <cf>from now on!
Then ...... we will try our hand at fishing for the sake of fish <cf>!
...... What?　A fish shop or fish market ......? <cf>Well, there are stores that sell them!
That is a relief. <cf>But a bit of a disappointment: ......
I'm running out of wooden swords for training. <cf>I'll have to order some: ......
Yeah, that's a big help. <cf>Thanks for taking me on.
At my orphanage, <cf>we teach self-defense to the kids.
These are the times we live in. <cf>You have to learn how to survive on your own.
But we're running out of wooden swords for training. <cf>They wield them so recklessly.
I've already ordered the new wooden sword, but I have to go to <cf>to pick it up.
Trouble is, the only time I see the kids is when <cf>the store is open.
Would you pick it up for me?
The store is behind the Arena. <cf>Just ask the owner.
I'm asking you to do it. <cf>If I say I'm Riza's messenger, you'll understand.
The wooden sword is behind the Arena. <cf>I ordered it from a merchant.
I look forward to working with you.
Hi, you're here to help Riza. <cf>It's a wooden sword for training, right? Thank you very much.
Hmm?　Oh, shoot! <cf>We just ran out of stock.
I just got a big order from the Asterleeds Guard at <cf>just a few minutes ago.
There's a platoon leader who's kind of uptight. <cf>[I'm going to train my men until they die! He's like, "["]".
After all, our wooden swords are cheap. <cf>But I'm also indebted to Riza-san.
I don't know what to do. ...... <cf>OK!　I'll let you in on the secret of our cheap wooden swords.
Actually, I'm buying the goblin's sticks from <cf>adventurers for a couple of bucks.
Not the big ones they use as weapons. <cf>It's a small stick they use to beat animals and their friends.
By the way, we call them "goblin sticks.
That's right. It's not a very good image to have, so <cf>they hide their true identity and sell it.
It's expensive for a proper craftsman to make it. <cf>What, it looks a little messy, but it's durable.
If you clean it well, <cf>you can use it as a regular wooden sword.
That's why I suggest you go directly to <cf>and get the "Goblin Stick".
Then we'll have them all in stock in no time. <cf>Riza's order was for 10 bottles.
You should be able to get it if you take out the goblins in "Dragon Claw Valley, Additional Research" at <cf>
I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here to get it.
The Goblin Stick can be obtained by defeating the <cf>goblins that inhabit Dragon Claw Valley.
You'll get your ten bottles in no time!
Ah, welcome back. <cf>I see you've received the wooden sword.
Oh yeah, this this this. <cf>They're sturdy, cheap, and helpful.
Something smells funny, but <cf>I'll get out of it as I use it.
...... What's up? <cf>You look like you have an opinion?
Oh well. I'll get someone else to deliver the payment to the <cf>store again.
Oh, you don't want it? <cf>No, no, no. Even stocking up isn't free.
You have to pay what you have to pay. <cf>...... You're getting more and more complicated, you know that?
Come to think of it, this looks somewhat like that thing. <cf>The stick that goblins sometimes carry: ......
...... haha, I see. <cf>So you got it yourself.
You see what I mean?　Hahaha, that's easy to understand. <cf>I like people like you.
Well, whatever the source, <cf>I appreciate it.
Thank you. Honest Adventurer.
The wooden sword you brought me, <cf>the kids are loving it!
It looks <cf>sturdy and hard to break, even when children swing it around recklessly.
Ekkushun!　Ekkushun! <cf>Oh, I'm sorry. I was sneezing a little too hard.
Ritze is always like this at this time of year. <cf>My nose is stuffy, my eyes are itchy. I just can't stand it.
Oh, no. We're talking about your job, right? <cf>My name is Ariane. I'm a perfumer.
I was thinking of making <cf>a new piece with materials from Montegnor Valley.
Then there were monsters in the mountains and I couldn't <cf>get the material.
He said the monsters are a herd of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>. <cf>Even the hunter blurted out that he couldn't get into the mountains.
I even had to sneeze to get here. <cf>Not my lucky day. ......
I live in Asterleeds with my daughter. <cf>We often come to Litze to buy ingredients for our perfumes.
Scent is a delicate thing. <cf>I wanted to be there to see for myself with my nose.
...... Well, it's a bad time of year <cf>I'm totally congested.
Anyway, get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>. <cf>Then you should be able to get the material ......
............ buekkushun! <cf>Ugh, this time of year is really, really bad.
...... kkk!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>is at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" in Montegnor Valley.
I need at least 10 of them to go away. <cf>Please ...... Kushu
Huekushun!　Huck Shun! <cf>Oh, welcome back to ...... Huck Shun!
...... wind. I've calmed down. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>You got rid of the "Mere Old Man". Thank you.
Well then, while you're at it, go to ...... <cf>to look for materials!　Hakkushon!
Mom, are you okay from earlier?
Oh my, Muir. <cf>Why are you here at ...... Kushun!
That's our line. <cf>You're not supposed to be out this time of year.
But. The flowers and grasses in Montegnor Valley <cf>smell best right now.
As a perfumer, I can't let the season pass me by. ...... <cf>Shun Ikkushun!　Fuekkushun!
Already. Mom tries too hard. <cf>She never listens when it comes to perfume.
That's because it's what makes my mom's life worth living. <cf>Smelling good makes you happy, doesn't it?
Only my mom can be so preoccupied <cf>with scents until her nose is wrong.
What the heck. You're being so plain ...... <cf>haha!
My mother was taken care of. ...... Huh? <cf>Adventurer, you smell kind of nice.
There's a canyon plant stuck to your clothes. <cf>Flowers I've never seen before. Sweet yet refreshing scent.
...... might be good. This would work if you combine "fig and <cf>"lime rose".
...... really nice scent ......
...... Oh. Oh, I'm sorry! <cf>It smelled so good, I got carried away.
...... Um, Mr. Adventurer. If you don't mind, <cf>would you be willing to do something selfish for me?
I need fresh "figs" and "lime roses" <cf>flowers. Preferably soon.
I have a feeling that you will make a very nice perfume. <cf>Of course I will thank you. Please do!
The "Ichimosei" is available at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"
The "Lime Rose" can be <cf>collected at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>"!
Please, please, please.
Thank you very much! <cf>I'll try to formulate it right away.
...... Yeah. Very nice scent, just as I expected! <cf>What do you think of the new candidate?　Mom.
What is it? <cf>I'm suddenly very motivated.
What can I say, you're my girl after all. <cf>You are so lively when it comes to fragrance.
I don't care. I don't sneeze and make perfume <cf>like my mom.
That's not what I'm talking about. Smell it. <cf>I'm proud of it.
I can't. My nose is stuffy.
Eh!　Heal, now!
Don't be absurd. When I get home I'll <cf>take my time and enjoy it.
Mmmm~....... The scent of this moment is something that can only be produced at <cf>this very moment.
Oh, dear. <cf>You've got a lot to say, don't you? Hmmm...
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>You and your son have been a great help to us all.
If you ever come to Asterleeds, <cf>please stop by our house!
A new fragrance from the signer. <cf>I'll let you serve it to me.
Adventurer ......?　You wanted to see me?
......Lindsay's letter to me! <cf>Seriously!　Let me see it!
Is that ......?　What the hell?
This is the letter I wrote you.
Why are you coming back? <cf>I asked the Bureau of Pioneer Affairs to come back.
First you write the sender's name, right? <cf>Then you turn it over and address it to ......
What? ...... address and sender are reversed! <cf>Is that so!
So that's what you're talking about. ....... <cf>So it came back to me, addressed to.
Wow, I screwed up!　What a disgrace!
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry for all the stupid trouble I put you through.
I've never written a letter before. <cf>I just learned how to write by watching and learning.
I guess the address is on the front and the sender is on the back. <cf>Okay, this time I remember!
Sorry to say this on the side. <cf>Once again, please deliver this to Mr. Lindsay.
Lindsay is that ...... guy I've always wanted to be.
I'm so grateful and respect him. <cf>I'm able to work and eat now because of him.
So I wanted to thank you once in a letter to ....... <cf>Hehe, that's kind of embarrassing, isn't it?
My handwriting is terrible and I wrote it wrong. <cf>Please deliver this letter to ...... Lindsay
We should be in the residential area towards the beach. <cf>Best regards, Mr. Adventurer.
Could you please deliver the letter to Ms. Lindsay.
I'm sure he's in the residential area by the beach. <cf>I can't get my head around that guy. ......
What, to deliver a letter to me? <cf>Wow, that's unusual. Thank you.
I'm a letter writer. <cf>I'm still confident in my handwriting.
So letters are all about sending to someone else. <cf>I'm a little nervous about receiving one myself.
Hmmm.......................from whom? <cf>Quickly ......
...... What?　Jeez!　Saul!
Oh, sorry. <cf>It was from someone I didn't expect. ......
The girl who gave me this letter, she couldn't write. <cf>His family was too poor to go to school.
He always looked at my work with envy. <cf>[He said, "[I want to] write too!
So I gave him a few pointers.
I moved away so soon, <cf>I didn't get a chance to help him out until the end.
It says, "I got a job." ...... <cf>Gosh. ...... I see. You did your best.
I'm sorry for my terrible handwriting," he said. <cf>It's true. It's smudged and hard to read. ......
Oh, I'm not quite there yet! <cf>I've never written such a heartfelt letter before!
Thanks for delivering, adventurer. <cf>I'll do my best not to lose to you, Saul!
I hope that one day, everyone can write. <cf>For there may be something I can do.
Oh, you ......!　Oh, you, you ...... <cf>adventurer who knows Brulin. ......
Mi, give me some water ...... ......!
...... Nngh, gosh, puh-lease!
Thanks to ....... <cf>Thanks to you, I've managed to speak.
It was my cousin Katya. <cf>She made a terrible dish!
The soup was nothing to look at. <cf>It tasted normal too. But after a while, it's hard!
My body is getting numb and I can't get my groove back. ...... <cf>I finally got stuck here.
Katya doesn't know about this yet. <cf>On the contrary, it's just because I made too much soup. ......
I'm going to serve that thing to the villagers and travelers! <cf>Please!　Katya and, and stop ......!
Well, I'm numb again ......! <cf>Katya's house is at the end of the village!　Ha, go quickly ......!
No...... I'm not going to be happy talking to you anymore....... <cf>Now I just need to ...... please ......!　(sound of gurgling)
...... Katya's house is ...... at the entrance to the village ...... <cf>Oh ...... please, is ...... quickly ......!
Oh, hello there. Hello, adventurer. <cf>I hope you are not hungry on your journey.
Actually, I made too much soup. <cf>Please enjoy it if you like.
What?　Did Melis stop you?　Why?
...... Has the soup made you numb? <cf>No way!
Me?　I didn't eat it, I'm fine. <cf>I have a cat tongue. I asked Melis to taste it.
Besides, this soup is <cf>something I'm not supposed to eat.
But what went wrong? <cf>Hmmm, I still want the recipe!
Ah, yes. You seem to know a lot of things, adventurer. <cf>Would you be willing to help us?
I made "Celebration Wedding Soup". <cf>It's a traditional Minsterhorn dish.
Every house has a different way of making it. <cf>My mom passed away before I was taught.
I can't seem to get it to work from hazy memory. ...... <cf>I guess I'd better look for a proper recipe.
So. I heard that there is a <cf>magnificent library on the second floor of the Asterleeds pioneer station. Do you know it?
Maybe there's a recipe for celebratory wedding soup left over there at <cf>.
So, please. <cf>Please take me to Asterleeds.
If you're in the archives on the second floor of the Pioneer Station in Asterleeds, <cf>they may have some recipes left.
Please. <cf>Please take me to the archives in Asterleeds.
Let's see, Minsterhorn-related literature: ....... <cf>Ah, there it is!
Yeah, it also mentions 'celebratory wedding soup'. <cf>It says it's a traditional dish that the bride serves to everyone at her wedding.
That's why brides aren't supposed to eat them. <cf>I'm a little disappointed that I went to the trouble of making it.
Oh ...... yeah. I'm getting married soon. Heh heh. <cf>So I need to learn to make soup properly.
Good. It's got the recipe right. <cf>...... Hmmm... but you've got most of the ingredients right.
Then I'd use different ingredients from house to house to make it unique. <cf>This is the only place I remember well.
My mom used to use 'crescent mushrooms'. <cf>They are crunchy and delicious.
But the crescent mushrooms have been over-harvested <cf>and now I can't find them anywhere!
So I used "Sea Moon Mushroom" which has a similar taste <cf>I think there was a numbing ingredient in it.
I can't get crescent mushrooms anymore and ....... <cf>But I really want to pass on my mother's taste and ......
Oh, that's right. <cf>Then why don't you put some medicinal herbs with it?
Medicinal herbs to relieve numbness...... this this this, "Young mua leaves". <cf>This is something you can get a lot of in the mountains.
If you use both young mua leaves and sea moon mushrooms <cf>you should be able to make a soup that won't numb.
Adventurer. <cf>I wonder if you could go and get me some young moor leaves.
I'll go home and prepare it again. <cf>I'll make a proper soup this time.
I want adventurers to go to <cf>and pick young mua leaves that grow in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
I'll go home and prepare the soup again.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. I see you brought the "Young Leaves of Mua" to <cf>, thank you!
Just in time. <cf>So chop it up and put it in the pot: ......
Yes, it's done!　It's my "Celebration Soup". <cf>Try it, Melis.
...... Must I eat it?
Already. You said you'd give me a taste. <cf>["]I'd rather ......["] than sacrifice others.
Yes, but ...... ingredients, you haven't changed, right? <cf>I mean, you had plenty of kaigetsu mushrooms in there earlier.
It's okay. That's why I asked the adventurer for <cf>mua young leaves.
Why don't you think <cf>in the direction of not using sea moon mushrooms.
Because this is the taste of our soup. <cf>That's the one thing I won't compromise on.
Haha ...... I get it. What the heck if you eat poison. <cf>Let's go out with them if they've come this far.
God of Bapharia, thank you for your grace today. <cf>Please protect us. I will take it from ......
Gokuri ......
......n............ Oh, what? <cf>...... mooch...... gong
Eh ...... Eh, what's this? <cf>It's soooo good!
It's mellow and deep. <cf>It's probably better than my aunt's soup!
The crunchiness of the sea moon mushrooms and the flavor of the young mua leaves are exquisite! <cf>I have never had such a delicious soup!
It doesn't numb my tongue at all, in fact it makes me feel healthier! <cf>I wouldn't be ashamed to feed this to anyone!
Yay!　We did it, adventurer! <cf>Thank you so much!
Now I can go to my bride with my heart in my chest. <cf>My mother will be relieved. And thank you, Melis.
Yes, yes, yes, thanks for the food. <cf>In more ways than one.
Now all I have to do is wait for my girlfriend to return? <cf>Yoan, have you heard from him yet?
Yeah. It's always the same. <cf>I don't mind waiting.
My girlfriend is also an adventurer. She is in Litze now. <cf>She travels a lot.
If you see an adventurer named Yoan, will you tell him? <cf>Katya's waiting for you.
I'll be waiting for you with some delicious soup. <cf>Come home soon, I said.
The adventurer who helped Mr. Chicken! <cf>You are helping us again, aren't you?
Now <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>is attacking <cf>your precious cow!
It's a cow! <cf>They are so cute and delicious!
Atashi, I can't allow it! <cf>I will punish you!
Let's work together, adventurers!
If we kill 5 of them per person, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>should get scared and run away!
Of course, I'm going to kill 5 cows too. <cf>Because it's for Cow's sake!
Please give me a call again when you are done. <cf>Then, let's get going!
No reservation!　No mercy! <cf>No hesitation!　No mercy!
<value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/><span size="Big">The - the - unforgivable! &lt;/&gt;
Okay! <cf>It's <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>in ' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>'!
Let's kill 5 cows per person and <cf>together keep the peace for the cows!
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>You have defeated the
Atashi is also perfect! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>I was able to get rid of the
We broke the whole herd apart so <cf>they should never be able to bully a cow again!
I feel safer now. <cf>Thanks to our adventurers.
Everyone in the village was thanking us, and <cf>Cow looked very happy, too!
He was a really cute cow! <cf>His muscles are toned and he looks so cool!
She's blood-colored, her skin is taut, <cf>and she gazes at me with dull eyes. ......
Oh, no!　I want to eat it!
So let's eat! <cf>Yes, I'll share it with the adventurers!　We'll share it with the adventurers!
Fresh, carefully selected, drool-worthy, freshly grated, superb loin meat! <cf>I rustled it up while we waited!
What do you think?　Beautiful red and pink! <cf>The best of the best, no question about it!
He was a wonderful cow, so I'm sure he'll be delicious! <cf>Oh, I'm drooling... Wipe, wipe, wipe!
The threads have been removed cleanly, and there are no unnecessary scratches. <cf>I am confident in my ability to use a beef knife!
Huh?　Is something wrong? <cf>Don't hesitate to take it. Please take it!
Thank you very much! <cf>And please help us if Cow gets bullied again.
Thank you for talking to me! <cf>Thank you for listening to me
My name is Bruin. <cf>I am a bard born here in Minsterhorn.
My specialty genre of song is local specialties! <cf>I'll sing about local things wherever I go.
Here's how it went. First of all, I thought I would sing about my birthplace, <cf>this village: ......
Now it's time to Minsterhorn!　And I'm thinking <cf>I don't even know what to sing!
So I thought~♪
Someone like you, who isn't from this village <cf>might have a different perspective.
Why don't you join me at <cf>and let's make up a theme to be sung in this village?
I need to hear from people in the village. <cf>Not someone who's dawdling like me.
Me asking around?　I can't do that. <cf>I can't do that, because we'd be talking about the old days, and the conversation wouldn't go anywhere.
If you guys have any ideas based on what you guys have said, you can talk to me again at <cf>. I'll be waiting!
I'll talk to everyone in this village and see if <cf>they can come up with something to talk to me about!
Adventurer?　Can I help you?
So, Bruelyn wants to write a song? <cf>That's amazing. I bow to that enthusiasm.
I see. <cf>So, tell me what's good about this village, and I'll tell you.
I don't know how hard it is for me, but <cf>this is a good village!
Even an unfriendly guy like myself is <cf>accepted and appreciated!
Are you talking about ...... specialty products or something a little more obvious? <cf>If so, all the vegetables from the fields are delicious!
I recommend tomatoes that are firm and flavorful. <cf>Celery is great not only for flavor, but also for aromatics!
If you would like, please bring some with you. <cf>If you could also tell the blueline to keep up the good work.
I recommend tomatoes and celery. <cf>They are all delicious vegetables that you can get from Mintterhorn!
If you could please pass this on to Blue Lynn.
Welcome back. Did you find <cf>any stories that might be useful for songwriting?
Vegetables from Lodi? <cf>Tomatoes and celery. This is fresh.
You're right, the vegetables here have always been delicious.
There are many other vegetable growers besides Roddy. <cf>However, vegetables can be found anywhere in Asteria Plain.
...... Okay. I wonder if I can cook something with these vegetables. <cf>Why don't you go ask for some?
I have a friend named Melis who works at a bar.
Maybe she can do something about it. <cf>Let's go.
My friend Melis could make a <cf>special dish with these vegetables!
Let's go to her place.
Oh, it's you, Blue Lynn. <cf>What are you doing with a vegetable in your arms?
Hey, Melis. I need a little favor. <cf>Actually, ......
Make a special dish with these vegetables? <cf>I don't know if I'm being told that at the drop of a hat. ......
I'm counting on you to do something about that. <cf>You were a good cook, weren't you?
I'm sorry to ruin the vegetables <cf>that Roddy gave me.
What?　Is that a vegetable that Roddy grew? <cf>Say that quickly!
Make it, make it! <cf>Please let me make it!
What's up with you all of a sudden? <cf>Oh, by the way, you've been talking about Roddy for a while ......
What are you talking about? <cf>We're just childhood friends!　Childhood friends!
I don't care <cf>about Roddy!
Mmm!　I've got a melody. <cf>Sweet and sour - Melisu's love tastes like veggies... ♪
Geez!　Stop it, blueline! <cf>Just wait a minute!
But still, I can't believe that blueliner wants to write a song about <cf>his hometown...
I wanted to write a song about the wonderfulness of my hometown <cf>after seeing the world at large!
Hmm?　I think it's a good idea. <cf>I like this village as much as you do.
Thank you!　Keep it up Roddy. <cf>Why don't you be honest?
I told you, Roddy had nothing to do with it! <cf>Here, wait for me!
It's a Minsterhorn-style soup with tomatoes and celery. <cf>Smells good, doesn't it?
Yup. Yes, the smell is appetizing, but it's <cf>the plain one!　That's what I'm talking about.
Tch tch tch tch. You're not ready if you're judging by appearances. <cf>Take a bite and then tell me.
Let's see, I'll take it. <cf>............!　Yum!
What the heck!　It's a rustic soup, yet <cf>incredible depth of flavor!
How's that?　Minsterhorn is also famous for its capers. <cf>Use a lot of capers.
Roddy's veggies and Atashi's capers. They go perfectly together! <cf>Oh no, what can I say?
...... is a bit!　I'm not eating all the time! <cf>Are you listening to people!
Oh, it was delicious!　Alrighty! <cf>You've got some creative juices flowing!
~ ...... tomatoes ~♪ ...... celery ~~ <cf>............ ............ Okay!
From now on, I will sing this song in the center of the village. <cf>You can come and listen to it too!
You are still going at your own pace. <cf>You can go and listen to him if you like.
But he's still serious about singing. <cf>Oh, yeah, ...... I should ask Roddy out too!
Blue Lynn will be performing a song in the center of the village. <cf>You can go and listen to it if you want.
Okay, if we can get this many people here, that's good.
Thank you for your patience!　So please listen, everyone. <cf>New song "Minsterhorn's Excellent Soup"
Tomatoes~♪ ...... alone is not enough~♪ <cf>Celery~♪ added and still not enough~♪
Delicious Minsterhorn's~♪♪ <cf>Delicious Delicious Minsterhorn's Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
The key to the soup is aaaaah! <cf>Caper!　It was you!
Tomatoes!　Celery!　Minsterhorn! <cf>Piles of capers!　Minsterhorn!
ああ～……ああああ～スープ～♪
............ Yay! <cf>Thank you very much!
What's that joke song you just sang? ...... <cf>Come on, let's go home. That was a waste of time.
Well, I thought it was funny! <cf>I'm glad it was weird!
Me too! <cf>Tomatoes!　Celery!　Ha-ha-ha!
Hey!　Stop it! <cf>Don't learn a funny song!
I thought it was a good song myself. <cf>And I'm glad you sang about vegetables.
The soup that inspired that song, <cf>I made it.
Really? <cf>I'd love to try it myself.
Well, then, let's go to my house now! <cf>I'll treat you to a full meal.
It seems to have won everyone's hearts in its own way. <cf>You still have a lot of training to do.
But then again, I realized. I wanted to be <cf>a little different from a minstrel. ......
I wanted to be a "publicity poet! <cf>I finally got it all straightened out. Thanks to you.
Thank you for giving me a theme for future activities. <cf>You have received your reward.
Now, we need to keep up the good work and promote the other villages! <cf>I'll do my best!
Hey, Klaus! <cf>Where'd you put your luggage!
What the hell, Lucas. <cf>You know what? I don't give a shit about your boring job, delivering packages.
I threw away all my stuff. <cf>I can't deliver what I don't have.
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing, man! <cf>We're the ones who took this job!
I'm just going to pretend that I don't know. <cf>Just pretend you don't know.
If you say, "["]we don't know["] <cf>no one will ever know.
Don't worry. <cf>I threw it away where you'll never find it.
I threw it over the cliff behind the temple. <cf>No one would go out of their way to look for it.
The parcel is down.
Looks like it was in the middle of a delivery. <cf>I wonder if someone forgot it.
If you know anyone who might be able to help, I'll deliver them to <cf>
Hey, Klaus! <cf>Go pick up your stuff now!
Do that and I'll pretend the whole thing never happened! <cf>You threw away a delivery package, that's a big deal!
Shut up. <cf>How many times do I have to tell you I don't like ......?
What's up, man? <cf>What do you want from us?
You look so good!　Your appearance! <cf>I can see that you must be a great adventurer!
In anticipation of you <cf>I have a favor to ask you!
Sorry. A simple delivery like this is not something I'd ask <cf>anyone to do for me.
Hmm?　Anta, that parcel is from ....... <cf>Why do you have our package?
Geez! <cf>You didn't go down that cliff, did you!
No way!!!　I thought if I dumped it there <cf>you'd never find it.
I'm sorry, I keep piling on. <cf>That's the package we were supposed to deliver.
I guess my partner threw me out. <cf>I'm glad you picked up the pieces.
I know this is a boring nappy, but please do me a favor. <cf>...... I have a few more things to say to this fool.
Oh, hey, Lukas. Don't get so mad. <cf>I'm just kidding, just a little ......, okay?　What?
I want the package to be delivered to the merchant in "Minsterhorn".
I'm sorry, but I need your help.
Oh, welcome. <cf>What can I do for you?
What?　You came to deliver a package?
Hmmm. Indeed, this is <cf>what I had ordered.
We had some items we needed to get in a bit of a rush, so we asked <cf>a couple of adventurers to help us out.
I believe their names are ...... <cf>Klaus and Lucas or something like that.
Did those two people ask you to do this? <cf>So you don't think that you forced someone else to do the request?
Oh my goodness, ....... <cf>Anyway, thanks for carrying it.
I'm just sorry, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Could you please accept your reward from those two.
I had to <cf>pay them both in advance because they insisted.
It's appalling. How can you be an <cf>adventurer if you can't even handle a simple request like this?
You should go back to <cf>Asterleeds before the two of you run away or something.
I'm sorry, but <cf>I've already given you my fee in advance.
Could you please receive it from those two guys in Asterleeds ...... <cf>Klaus and Lucas
You delivered the package, didn't you? <cf>Thank you so much. You've been a big help.
I told my partner tightly. <cf>Hey, Klaus. You have something to say.
Damn. ....... My bad.
[You said yourself that you were going to be an adventurer, <cf>and this is the first request you've received.
Delivering packages is so plain and boring! <cf>Let's do something more flashy if we're adventurers!
Dragon slaying, for example. <cf>You have requests like that, don't you?
What a stupid thing for a guy who looks like a deserter from the Knights <cf>to say ......
Oh, yes. I'll give you the money I got up front. <cf>You're the one who made the delivery.
Hey, hey!　Wait a minute, Lucas! <cf>That's the money we got!
You did the work for us. <cf>It's pretty clear who should pay.
Now we're broke! <cf>Hey, let's hurry up and find the next commission!
I'll pick the next one! <cf>The one that makes proper money and looks like fun!
All right, all right. <cf>Don't throw me out in the middle this time.
Thanks for taking care of me, Anta. <cf>Next time I'll at least try not to bother people.
Ah, you must be the adventurer from the other day. <cf>You've come to the right place. A little help here.
My partner is about to do something reckless. <cf>Will you join me in stopping him?
What's reckless? <cf>It's just defeating monsters.
I guess being an adventurer is all about fighting, right? <cf>I'm not going to do all the heavy lifting!
So, let's go, Lucas. <cf>Now get ready to go.
We can't do it," he said!
Hey, hey. You're still a member of the glorious <cf>Order of Bernhardt?
You're not one of us. We're deserters.
I think you and I both ran away from the <cf>knighthood because we couldn't stand the rigors of training.
Well, that's true, but ......
But we're ex-knights, even if we are rotten.
I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it! <cf>If I could beat you with my title, I wouldn't have any trouble!
Hey, you can tell him, too. <cf>The work of an adventurer is not that easy.
Mmm. What's with the eyes? <cf>I'm telling you, I don't need your help.
If you can do it, why can't I? <cf>I'm a full-fledged adventurer now!　Watch!
Hey, wait!　Klaus!
Gone is ....... <cf>Klaus says yeah, but I still can't do it.
Please, help me! <cf>I know he's a jerk, but he's my friend.
The monster we are looking for is in the "Soundless City". <cf>But I think Klaus will get away quickly.
He's a guy who can't do anything really dangerous. <cf>He's got to be tucked away somewhere safe.
A place where there are soldiers, Bapharia guards, etc. <cf>Does that ring a bell?　Let's go there!
You say there is a garrison at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>"? <cf>I see. It seems safe there.
Klaus might roll in there too. <cf>Let's go after him as soon as possible!
Awww ....... <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>Soooo strong, soooo scary. ......
I knew it. ....... <cf>You got away with it because you were totally out of your depth.
Klaus, as you can see, is a real terror. <cf>He was totally intimidated by the strength of his opponent.
Well, I'm glad you're okay. ......
Can you show Klaus what a real adventurer <cf>is capable of?
I need you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>".
We'll be watching from a safe distance. <cf>And of course, we'll thank you for taking them down.
We'll meet back here when we're done. <cf>Well, then, good luck to you.
I need you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>in "Soundless City, Additional Research."
Show Klaus what a real adventurer is capable of <cf>
Good job. <cf>You've shown me what a fighter you are.
I guess real adventurers are different. <cf>We are not good enough.
Yes, you're right. ....... <cf>I feel like I know what I'm getting myself into.
You understand? <cf>No more reckless behavior, okay?
Oh ...... I understand well. <cf>I need to get my body back in shape first!
You were so cool! <cf>I wish I could fight like you!
That's why I'm going back to the Order. <cf>I'm going to Accept training from the beginning!
Klaus, you ......! <cf>Have you made up your mind to go back to your country?
But we're deserters, remember? <cf>I don't know if they'll let us. ......
If you apologize sincerely, they will surely forgive you. <cf>Accept some punishment, but it is what it is.
Yeah, ......, I know. <cf>Of course I apologize too, along with you.
All right, then, let's get ready!　Once that's decided, let's get ready to go. <cf>Come on, Lucas. Don't be lazy!
Adventurer. <cf>Thank you so much for getting Klaus back on his feet.
I came all this way to accompany him on his escape, but <cf>I wanted him to be a great knight.
We'll both go back to the country and start over. <cf>I won't run away again.
If you ever come to the Principality of Bernhardt someday, <cf>you should definitely come see me.
A brown, dirty package has fallen.
It looks very old, but <cf>it's packed very well and the contents are safe.
There may be someone looking for it. <cf>If we find them, we'll deliver them to you.
Oh, you've come to the right place! <cf>I am Lector. I am your colleague.
I was on my way to deliver a precious cargo when <cf>we got caught in a terrible storm.
We are stuck and in trouble.
...... Mmmm!　You, that package!
It must have been dropped by me! <cf>It's very dirty. ...... No, I'm sure of it!
You picked it up! <cf>Thank you!　I've been looking for you for a long time.
Now we can finally leave. <cf>Can't you do one more job for us?
It is by the grace of the gods of Bapharia that we met here. <cf>Please take me to Asterleeds.
Thank you again and again for your hospitality. <cf>This Rector, I will not forget your kindness.
But that storm was terrible.
Storms, lightning strikes, and even a landslide. <cf>I felt like I had not lived at all.
You were too, weren't you? <cf>It was a once-in-a-decade, once-in-a-decade rough patch.
...... What? <cf>No storms in the last few days?
It can't be true. <cf>I was actually lost.
Hmmm ....... Yes, the clothes are dry and <cf>there doesn't seem to be any trace of rain. ......
Well, let's not dwell on the details. <cf>It's more about the luggage.
This is essential for the future of Asterleeds' ...... or even <cf>the future of humanity!
I will never give it up. <cf>As long as I have this, I can't die.
So, <cf>take me to Asterleeds.
If I return to the Pioneer Station, my mission will be accomplished. <cf>Please take care of me.
For the future of humanity, <cf>this mission must be accomplished.
Take me to the Pioneer Bureau's stacks in Asterleeds at <cf>.
Please, take care of them.
What a surprise, this is ......!
It's a wonderful collection of books. ...... <cf>Such a great collection of books......
The walls are filled with shelves and books. <cf>It is just as I had imagined in my dream.
Books are the source of knowledge. It is an irreplaceable social treasure that we can learn about the world and pass on to our descendants. <cf>
It cannot defeat demons, cure disease, or feed the hungry. <cf>And yet the book holds power and hope.
That's exactly what I wanted people to know about ....... <cf>I wanted to build a treasure trove of knowledge here in Asterleeds.
So ....... What I've been doing <cf>wasn't wrong. ......
Thank you. Thanks to you. <cf>This is exactly what I wanted to see. Thank you.
Last request. <cf>I want you to put this book in the stacks.
My last book ....... Please put this poor memoir in a corner of your <cf>wonderful bookshelf!
The book has fallen where Lector was. <cf>I'll put them in the bookshelf at the Pioneer Station.
Um, can I help you?
You have been staring intently at <cf>the bookshelf since a few minutes ago. ......
What?　Is there anyone with you? <cf>No, I'm afraid there is no one here but you. ......
Oh, perhaps you have come to donate? <cf>What you have is a book.
The Pioneer Bureau is working on a book collection. <cf>This "Great Bookcase of the Rectors" was created for that purpose.
It's named after <cf>a great adventurer who was active when Asterleeds became independent!
Juan Lector. He was a collector of many books and <cf>left behind a valuable history for future generations!
Of course, he's 400 years old. <cf>He's already dead.
On the way to transport the book, he was hit by a storm in Bahamar Highland <cf>and was lost and never returned. ......
The Pioneer Bureau has decided to continue his legacy and leave various books in the <cf>"Great Bookshelf of the Rectors".
Oh, could you please donate it? <cf>Thank you very much. We will take good care of it.
Of course, I'll put it in the "Grande Bibliothèque du Lecteur". <cf>But it is a very old memoir, isn't it?
...... Oh?　There's something stuck in the wrapping paper.
Is this a ...... Imagine Seed? <cf>Where did it get mixed in?
It's strange, but ...... somehow <cf>seems to give off a warm glow!
Maybe the Rectors are still watching over Asterleeds at <cf>somewhere!
Cat-sama~! Where are you~?
You're hurt. <cf>Don't go far~!
Oh, I'm so lazy! <cf>I wonder if anyone oddballs have seen them or something.
I'm sure he's around here somewhere. <cf>Wait a minute. What a cat!
Meow!　Meow! ......
Found an injured cat.
It appears to be a domesticated cat. <cf>But it was too frightened to come closer.
Meow!　Meow!
He got away.
I'll let you know if I see the owner.
Sigh~, I'm really tired! <cf>Where did you go, Cat-sama~?
...... What? <cf>Did you see an injured cat?
Hmmm...hmmm...hohoho. The fur color and the gala match ....... <cf>That's probably our house cat.
Yay! There you are, the odd man out~. <cf>Thanks for telling us, adventurer.
By the way, can you please send me one request for <cf>?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you so much. <cf>For taking me on.
I am an indoor person to begin with. <cf>Working outside is not my specialty.
Too much space in Asterleeds to begin with. <cf>And too many cats.
So, I am very tired. <cf>I feel like I could use a cat's help.
At any rate, Atashi, I'll try to find this <cf>one more time.
Adventurers, please look around the town. <cf>If you see an injured cat, could you bring it to us?
Well then, I look forward to working with you. <cf>I'm so tired!
I know it's a bit tedious, but thank you in advance.
Cat-sama~ where are you~?
He was picked up meekly. <cf>Seems like a friendly cat.
The cat is staring at us.
Let's take him to Tini's.
Oh, hi. Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for your help in finding the cat.
Was there a cat?　The cat that ran away from us.
Oh, I'm sorry. <cf>I had an injured cat over here, too.
I'm not a cat lady. <cf>I was just examining her.
I can at least patch them up as part of my maid's duties. <cf>Well, animals are not my specialty.
Oh, I see. The adventurer found it. <cf>The cat is injured too, right?
Which...... ah, you are indeed injured. <cf>But it's not our cat. Here it is...
Ours have a bit more of a sassy look to them. <cf>It's usually hard to tell the difference between cats.
Yes, yes, don't worry. <cf>We'll take care of you too. I know it's tiring.
So, I'm sorry. I'm sure there are other injured cats <cf>, can you help me find them again?
They might be on the roof or in some other awkward place. <cf>You know, cats have a tendency to do that.
Oh, it's really tedious. <cf>It's so tedious, let's get to it.
Have you looked for it on the roof? <cf>Cats often climb up there.
Our cat may be there too. <cf>Best regards.
Well, there are so many roofs. ...... <cf>It's so tiring, really!
I tried to pick him up and he scratched me: ......
The cat started wriggling to get away.
Let's get him to Tini's before he runs away.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Did you find the cat, sir?
What?　He's not the same guy or <cf>another cat!
There are a bit too many injured cats, aren't there? <cf>What's going on in this town?
Oh, I don't want to do it anymore. It's really bothering me. <cf>Oh, enough. Okay, okay.
Adventurer. Change of plans.
Can you bring every single injured cat to <cf>?
It's so annoying now that I'm going to <cf>treat it all together.
Oh, well. <cf>I should have done that from the beginning.
If you catch them all, you'll find our <cf>cat among them!
Hey, you guys. Get away from me. <cf>Don't get on my shoulders. Don't get on my lap.
I'm going to fix you all, just wait and see.
Well, I'll just sit back and take care of it.
Every last one! <cf>Please, Mr. Adventurer.
If we catch every single one of them, <cf>my cat will be there too!
Look for it on every side of the city!
I'll be fine in a minute, so don't make a fuss~!
Find all the cats and bring them to <cf>Tini!
Here's how to do it: ...... <cf>Yes, done!
Ah, it's finally over!
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry I got you into all this trouble.
I ended up scavenging cats from all over town. <cf>If it weren't for the adventurers, we would have been in trouble.
Thanks to you, we found our cat, too. <cf>I can finally go home. Ah, it's so dull!
These kids have been treated and fed. <cf>They should be quiet for a while.
Thank you very much. Here, thank you.
Yes, yes, cat-sama. I'm going home~. <cf>Ah, it was really sluggish.
I wonder if I can get a little bonus. <cf>You should ask the master for one from the cat, too.
Are you the adventurer who came to <cf>at the request of the Pioneer Bureau?
Thank you!　I am Cyril, the client. <cf>I'm sorry for such a dubious request.
It's a little difficult to ask in a loud voice. <cf>Actually, there is something I want you to bring me in secret.
It's all about ...... "Crab"!
Shhhh!　Your voice is so loud! <cf>What if someone hears us?
Asterleeds is famous for its seafood. <cf>I think adventurers often eat there.
But crab is an exception. <cf>You can't even find them at the market.
Crabs eat everything and 'devour the sea' <cf>Fishermen hate them.
There's a saying that goes, "If you eat crabs, you'll start devouring everything <cf>in the same way."
That's why even in the Bapharia temple in Asterleeds <cf>it's forbidden to eat crab!
However, strictly speaking, we just avoid eating it. <cf>It's not forbidden by the doctrine.
And this isn't Asterleeds either, so <cf>I'm not afraid to eat it, even if it's land-based!
Well, when I found out, I was really excited. <cf>I thought, "If I get assigned to a garrison, I can eat crab!　I thought.
Well, the problem is that I can't move from here <cf>and I can't get the crabs that are so important ......
So, I asked the adventurers for a favor. <cf>I asked the adventurer, "Can you get me a cup of Aster Crabs?
I'm sorry, I'm not sure. The connoisseurs count crabs as "cups". <cf>Did you know that?
I think you have to catch it at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>". <cf>It is recommended to collect them at a point near the water!
Asterleeds doesn't sell it, so I'm asking you to do it for me. <cf>Please don't tell anyone!
Aster crabs" are not sold in stores, so you have to go to <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>to catch them.
It is recommended to collect it at a point near the water. <cf>Please don't tell anyone!
Wow!　A huge "Aster Crab"! <cf>You really caught it, wow!
It was worth asking the adventurer. <cf>It's rare to see crabs.
If I lived in Asterleeds, <cf>they wouldn't let me eat it because it's bad luck.
This is it!　This is it, this is it! <cf>These are thick scissors. The shell is also flat!
Oh, isn't this the best drink ever? <cf>I wonder what it tastes like.
Boiled or grilled <cf>seems to be the best way to eat it simply.
I hear that the meat inside the shell is also delicious! <cf>What?　How do you know so much about it?
Of course, ...... you heard it from someone who actually ate it. <cf>
The more they are told not to eat, the more they want to eat. <cf>There are a lot of people like that.
Even the receptionist at the pioneering bureau has an ...... page. <cf>I'm sorry. Please don't go any further.
I swear to the Gods of Bapharia, I will not sell out my comrades who are pursuing the path of "food" <cf>
Anyway, thank you very much for your kindness! <cf>I will never forget this debt of gratitude!
I'll be gone while I'm eating <cf>so you won't find me. See ya!
Oh?　We meet again, adventurer. <cf>Have you come all the way to this place to listen to my lecture?
A wonderful quest. Good! <cf>Now, let's get started with a new interpretation of the visitors: ......
Oh, no? <cf>......, that's the one that asked for the Pioneer Bureau.
Hmmm. I do remember that it's been <cf>days since I started excavating.
Preserved food?　...... Oh. It's true. <cf>It's gone. When did that happen?
No, but. We cannot leave here. <cf>Because!　Look at this!
This!　This buried tablet!　Here! <cf>It says "Raiji ......" and "...... Kai"!
Do you understand?　...... Yes! <cf>It is definitely "The Visitor" and "The Founder"!
At last!　I !　I have found a <cf>clue that connects the comer to the founder!
Ah, but!　What a surprise! <cf>The tools for excavation were broken!
God!　Why do you bring trials to me <cf>in the face of the truth?
...... What?　Oh my! <cf>You will dig it out for us!
Wonderful! <cf>You too want to explore the truth.
Then let's dig! <cf>Let's do it, let's dig!　Come on, come on!
There are 5 stone slabs left. <cf>They can be found by collecting ore in the "Andra Basin."
Until the excavation is finished <cf>I will never leave!
There are five stone slabs that would connect the visitors and the founder. <cf>They should be buried somewhere in the "Andra Basin."
Perhaps it's mixed in with the ore. <cf>If you collect it, there is a good chance you will find it!
You have unearthed all the stone slabs! <cf>Wonderful!　Thank you, God!
I can read!　You can read! <cf>......Raiji......Kai......
This is ......!
...... "The entrance to your visit is on the second floor" ......?
Visit ...... visit ...... upstairs ....... <cf>......Raiji......Kai......
Looks like ...... just an old information board. <cf>Must have been weathered from being discarded.
It seems to have nothing to do with the Visitor or the Founder.
Haha!　Well, this is what learning is all about. <cf>So much of our hard work ends up in vain!
But I'm sure the accumulation of all that waste leads to <cf>truth!
History is the accumulation of human deeds. <cf>The smallest of events can make a great history.
The fact that we dug up the information board here <cf>may be significant in later history!
Nevertheless, I have put you through a lot of unnecessary trouble. <cf>Let's go home quietly here.
If you ask that thing to do it every time, <cf>they may eventually charge you a fee for the request.
Thank you for your help. <cf>Let's talk about it at length next time.
There's a <cf>camp near here where the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>guys live, do you know it?
The guys there have been trolling <cf>Minsterhorn for a while now.
And every time they do, the Pioneer Bureau sends a request to <cf>to take it down.
That's what I've been asked to do, ...... <cf>but don't you think it's better to cut off the source?
As long as there's a camp, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>they'll <cf>keep coming back.
And then they come back to Minsterhorn. <cf>It's the same thing over and over again.
So I thought I'd give it a thorough beating. <cf>And that's where you came in.
The Pioneer Bureau told us to get rid of them, but no one wants to see <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>go down.
Let's help Minsterhorn out ourselves!
Yes, ....... If they kill five of them, that's good. <cf>That camp there will be useless.
I'll take care of the guys in the other place. <cf>I'll meet you back here when I'm done.
The <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>guys who attack Minsterhorn live in a camp near here <cf>
When we're done taking them down five of them, <cf>we'll meet up here again!
Yo!　That's awesome, dude!
I caught a glimpse of them fighting. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>How unapproachable!
Well, that was exhilarating. <cf>They ran away with their tails between their legs.
That should quiet them down for a while. <cf>All right, all right. All is well.
See?　Check it out!　Thanks to you, <cf>I got plenty of material!
I couldn't have taken down all these guys by myself. <cf>I wouldn't have gotten half the materials.
Especially furs! <cf>I have a source that buys them at a high price.
Hmm?　Yeah, man, that's right. I said, "You'll make more money <cf>two of us because of the amount of material we have.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>The more you defeat the "Mere Old Man," the more materials you get. <cf>See?　That was a tasty story, wasn't it?
This is why you can't stop <cf>defeating monsters!
Now, let's pull out. <cf>Thank you very much. You've been a big help.
If I see you again somewhere, I'll ask you to do the same. <cf>See you!
Thank you for taking care of it. <cf>This is "Kagemoishi".
It is said to be a fossil of old algae. <cf>They say it can be used as a medicine when processed.
We go digging sometimes too. <cf>There's been a lot of monsters around lately.
If it's a controlled mine shaft, it's still <cf>dangerous to mine anywhere else.
You're an adventurer, you're good at what you do, right? <cf>That's why I'd like to hire you to do some mining for me.
Three of them should be enough. <cf>I don't think it'll take that long.
It is to be delivered to a doctor named Volker in Larpal. <cf>I've already spoken to him, so please take it directly to him.
Shadowstone can be mined at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>
Deliver it to a doctor named Volker in Larpal, <cf>and take it directly to him. I'm asking you to.
Oh, I've been waiting for you! <cf>I know you brought the "Shadow Algae Stone".
A stone delivery for the doctor, huh?　Gahaha!
Boring, huh?　Well, don't worry about it. <cf>It's a doctor's job to put patients at ease.
Let's see what you got.
Oh, I like it!　It's a "Shadow Algae Stone" of the finest quality.
This is. Make it into an ointment and use it to treat <cf>sock sores. Works well.
Larpal is at the knee of the Pillar of Divinity. <cf>Isn't it a famous Bapharia pilgrimage site?
In the Bapharia religion, they say that the more painful the pilgrimage, the more <cf>painful it is, the better off you'll be.
People, you walk on mountain trails and scrape your shoes, but you don't <cf>heal them. Stupid!　Gahaha!
You do that and then when you're done with your pilgrimage, <cf>you cry to a doctor like me.
I have no choice, so I usually do this <cf>and wait for them to get their meds ready.
If you've got a sock, we'll fix it right up! <cf>No?　That's fine!
These deliveries were done by Bauman's <cf>son.
This guy is called Einar. Rumor has it he left Ritze <cf>to become an actor.
If you see him, tell him I missed him. <cf>Baumann must miss you too.
Oops, almost forgot to thank you. <cf>You take care of your feet, too. Gahaha!
(......ッ!　(...... seen?)
...... Hello, adventurer. <cf>How can I help you here?
Walking down a dark alley is dangerous. <cf>You may find yourself in an unexpected place, in an unexpected place!
I think it's vital that you leave a complete stranger's child <cf>alone!
Curiosity in moderation. ...... <cf>Hmmm. Have a nice day.
(Still following ......)
...... How can I help you, adventurer? <cf>There's nothing ahead of you, sir.
You can't possibly have followed me to ...... <cf>, can you?
I can't believe I'm following a kid in an alleyway. <cf>I don't know if they look at me funny, okay?
You can shout louder at ....... <cf>Let's keep it naive here.
Please do not let it get to this point. <cf>It is for the both of us. Good bye, then.
Mr. Adventurer ....... <cf>I'm not impressed with you following a girl around.
I can't believe I nailed you so hard <cf>to get to this place.
But ...... I'm sure you were worried about me <cf>and followed me!
You saw a kid walking down an alleyway alone <cf>and it got your attention, didn't it?
Hmmm. Thank you, I will try and get back to you soon. Ah ......
I'm sorry. I'm in tears. ......
I've never had someone care about me like this <cf>before. ......
Maybe ...... me, I wanted someone like you <cf>to speak to me!
Kind adventurer. <cf>Will you please listen to me?
What I would like to ask you to do is to dispose of these burlap sacks. <cf>I was originally asked to do this.
You see, even a grown man <cf>can hold a whole bag of them, can't he?
It's too bulky and heavy <cf>for me to carry by myself.
Is it inside?　...... Yes, it is. <cf>[--]It's "Pig's Corpse".
It was also one that died from a contagious disease. <cf>We have to dispose of it in a place where people can't get to it.
......?　Can I help you? <cf>Oh, never mind.
It's not uncommon for a kid with no relatives like me to get a job like this <cf>
Because big cities like Asterleeds create <cf>a lot of dirty work, too.
Don't worry. It's a contagious disease, but <cf>it rarely infects people!
If you go east through the "Minster Hills," you will come to the sea. <cf>Throw it down from there and you're good to go.
When you are done, could you let a man named Koshimo know <cf>
Job Requester. I will let the adventurer know that he can pay me at <cf>
Please do not look inside the bag. <cf>It will make you feel bad and
[--]"Curiosity kills cats," so they say.
Ufufu, please don't look so scared. <cf>Well then, I look forward to working with you.
The burlap sacks can be found by going east through the "Minster Hills" <cf>to the ocean, where you can throw them away.
When you are done, can you let Koshimo at Asterleeds know <cf>
Even though it's a dead pig, it makes me sick. <cf>Please do not look inside the bag!
Niki gave me a burlap sack and I threw it into the <cf>ocean.
Report to Koshimo in Asterleeds!
Hi-yi-yi-yi! <cf>Don't come, don't come!
Oh, you're not going to kill me! <cf>My men will be here soon!　I'm gonna get you back!
So get the hell out of here! <cf>Get away from me!　Get away from me!
...... Hey, what the hell. What the heck? <cf>You look like you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Don't be so coy! <cf>You're one of Niki's guys!
Someone saw you take the bag Niki gave you <cf>!
You just asked me to ...... ......? <cf>So you're the one who cleaned up the mess. ......
Don't tell me ...... you really don't know Niki? <cf>Oh yeah, ...... that's why you lent him a hand?
You're a disaster too ....... He may be a kid, but <cf>he's a real assassin.
There's no one in that line of work who doesn't know. <cf>If you're on the radar, you'll get fucked. You'll get screwed for sure.
My buddy Niki found me. <cf>He's probably somewhere being fed to the fishes by now. ......
Look, it's a warning letter. You're next. <cf>...... and it's got your buddy's finger in it too.
All my men heard Niki's name and ran away. <cf>It was the end for me!
...... Hey, please. I will give you all the money I have. <cf>Take me to the temple of Bapharia!
I've had enough of this. I'm going to wash my feet. I repent. <cf>I'd rather be caught than have my life in danger!
If I walk alone, Niki's guy will kill me! <cf>Please!　It's for your own good!
If I don't do something, Niki's going to kill me! <cf>Take me to the temple of Bapharia!
Please!　It's for your own good!
Welcome to Temple Bapharia. <cf>Hmm ......?　You're Koshmo, the moneylender, aren't you?
Husband!　Please, let me in!
What?　What kind of windbag is this? <cf>You know what I mean.
Your business practices are beyond reproach. <cf>There's even a wanted man circulating from the Guard.
Are you saying that you are aware of this and are willing to turn yourself in? <cf>Otherwise, I will not allow you to enter my sacred temple.
That's fine!　Just let me in! <cf>I'll listen to as many sermons as I want later!
I've come to the contemplation just like you said! <cf>Please help me quickly!
What are you so upset about? <cf>All right, all right. Just be quiet for a minute.
I told him to ["]come["], but he didn't listen to me. <cf>Anyway, let's hear what you have to say.
[Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Adventurer.
The guy from Kosimo was caught meekly. <cf>We'll be handing him over to the security forces soon.
After that, I'm going to jail. It can't be helped. <cf>He's a man who's done that much.
Still, I didn't expect that notorious loan shark to come to <cf>himself to repent.
I told him again and again from the temple to turn himself in. <cf>He didn't listen to me as if he was not listening.
It was as if a person had changed and become more honest. <cf>He had been frightened for a long time. I wonder what happened to him?
Well, good for you if you repent. Thank you for your hospitality. <cf>Here is the temple's gratuity. I would like you to pay it.
Maybe this will make the city a little more pleasant. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation. Good bye.
What am I doing here? <cf>Can't you see it?
I collect material for costumes. <cf>I'm a fashion designer.
I'm launching a new brand next time I'm in the market. <cf>I need to showcase my originality!
Yes, I do. If you're an adventurer, <cf>you can collect materials outside the city, right?
Come take a peek at my store if you like. <cf>I may have something to ask you. See you later!
If you see Thierry in town, go to <cf>and talk to him.
Oh, hey, the adventurer from earlier. <cf>I'm so glad you came, welcome!
Hmmm ....... I thought of you at the bottom of the cliff, but <cf>you ...... are nice!
At the first glance, I was surprised!　I was like, "Wow! <cf>You have good taste and above all, you are a nice person.
Can you help us get the store ready to open at <cf>?
Thanks! <cf>I just didn't have enough hands to gather the materials for the outfit.
I've collected almost everything I can get my hands on in Asterleeds, <cf>
There's still <cf>all sorts of materials left that you can only get outside of the city.
First, three "horned goat wool". <cf>That fuzzy feeling is the best.
Then there are five [phosphorescent threads]. <cf>It's essential to make it look gorgeous.
Also, please give me five "Shanari Grass". <cf>It makes the dough so smooth. Did you know that?
I'm sorry it's kind of massive. <cf>But you'll be fine, right?
I'm sure you'll bring me some quality <cf>I trust. Well then, best wishes to you!
We need a lot of costumes for the opening, so <cf>Sorry for asking for so much!
All of the things you asked for are available at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland.
Tsunoyagi Wool" is available at <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>
Rinko Yarn" can be found at <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>
Go ahead and mow the "shanary grass.
I trust you'll bring me quality <cf>. Best regards!
You've done a great job collecting them. Thank you! <cf>Which one: ......
Well, this color and gloss. And the texture. <cf>It's perfect!　Top quality!
I'm so proud of you for putting together such a great lineup. <cf>I knew I was right!
This would be a great foil for the brand. <cf>Alright, let's do it!
Watch. Asterleeds, the city of fashion! <cf>I'm going to dye it with my brand!
I am still a warrior. <cf>I have a good eye for people.
Can you lend me your military prowess? <cf>I am grateful.
I have heard that when you express your intention, you should prepare <cf>a "proof" accordingly.
Even in my hometown, there is a ritual of putting grass dolls or human-shaped paper <cf>as a reminder of the other person.
It seems that no matter where you go, people still put strong feelings into something <cf>and make it their proof.
It's also said that loyalty and affection ...... sometimes hold a grudge <cf>there.
Oops, I got off topic. That's why <cf>would like to use it as a "testimony" too!
I've been looking for material for this, but <cf>I'm afraid time is a little short.
The next full moon ...... must be settled by then at the latest <cf>
Normally, I should be the only one to do this. <cf>However, I would like to humbly ask for your help here.
I want you to get 8 each of "Red Fangs of Rumblebore" and <cf>"Cave Zero Ore".
Only a skilled person can do this. <cf>Please help us.
The materials I need you to collect are <cf>"Red Fangs of Rumblebore" and "Cave Zero Ore".
The "Cave Zero Mine" should be found in the "Melisos River Basin" at <cf>
The "Red Fang of Rumblebore" can be obtained from <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>
We must settle this before the next full moon, so please help us <cf>
Dear Adventurer! <cf>I see you have gathered the materials I requested.
Oh, what magnificent crimson fangs! <cf>The "Cave Zero Ore" shines wonderfully, too!
After all, there was nothing wrong with his eyes. <cf>A brilliant move. I admire you very much.
That's what I've been waiting for. <cf>I can't stand it. Now I have everything I need!
All that remains is for me to make the proof myself. <cf>I have nails and hammers ready.
With this much effort and care, <cf>I am sure that it will fulfill its destiny!
I will never forget your help. <cf>This is just a small token of my gratitude. Please accept it.
Hey, Feodor! <cf>I thought it wasn't going to rain!
You're not being nice! <cf>Thanks to you, my laundry is not soaking wet!
Calm down, ma'am. <cf>A weather forecast is just a forecast. It can come off.
I too was surprised that it rained. <cf>Weather is sometimes beyond human prediction. ......
You don't have to quibble! <cf>You made the mistake of trusting me just because I'm a scholar.
I can guess tomorrow's weather." <cf>What a hoot, indeed!
Oh dear, ....... <cf>Sorry to show you all the fuss.
As requested. <cf>I am trying to achieve 'weather forecasting'.
I'm not just talking about tomorrow's weather ......, but <cf>I want to be able to accurately forecast changes in the weather!
As part of my daily routine, I forecast the weather for the next day. <cf>The next few days will be sunny.
I was saying that and then it started raining <cf>and the lady was thunderstruck...
It means they couldn't have predicted rain or thunder. <cf>...... Yeah, not so good.
Anyway, the observations are not enough at all. <cf>The forecasts aren't accurate enough to be of any practical use.
So I'd like to ask you to do some <cf>weather observations in Asteria Plain.
I'm going to give you some points of interest now. <cf>Go there and activate this recorder.
It's Bapharia's legacy, so it will automatically record what you need to <cf>. Easy enough, right?
They are expensive, so please don't lose or <cf>break them.
Those of us who pursue research are far from money. <cf>Oh, don't worry, we'll get you paid.
I can observe the area near Asterleeds, so <cf>I'd like to ask you to do the far side. Best regards.
The observation point is <cf>The easternmost point of the "Minster Hills
Points southwest of "Andra Basin"
The three westernmost locations of the Calm Eve Terraces.
Please activate the recorder there. <cf>Thank you.
Weather in the "Minster Hills" recorded.
The weather in the "Andra Basin" is documented.
The weather in "Calm Eve Terraces" was recorded.
Hey, good job. <cf>Looks like you finished your weather observation.
Oh, this is wonderful! <cf>I got a valuable record. Thank you.
...... my family used to be on a <cf>liner to Bernhardt and we got caught in a storm.
The ship sank and my family never returned. <cf>I still wish I could have foreseen the storm ......
It may be presumptuous for a person to know the future. <cf>I've been asked if I want to be a god.
It's also a source of laughter. If you want to know what the weather will be like tomorrow, <cf>you're better off relying on your fisherman's instincts, because they're much more accurate.
Still, if we continue to make steady observations, <cf>someday we can predict a storm or even a drought!
Sunny or rainy? We don't even know that right now, but <cf>still need a weather forecast.
Not only is it useful, <cf>I believe it can be a life-saving force for many
......I've talked too much. <cf>You seem to have something about you that makes people open up.
I ask you again. <cf>For the future of weather forecasting, I need your help.
The package I ordered has not arrived at the mansion. <cf>I am in trouble.
I've included the seal of the Asterleeds council, so <cf>the bandits shouldn't be able to get their hands on it, but ......
Luggage is scattered all over the place. <cf>Looks like it was ransacked by monsters.
The packing slip bears the seal of the Congress of Asterleeds.
It might be an important package. <cf>I can't deliver it all, but I can deliver a packing slip.
I'll let you know if anyone is waiting for a package.
I put in the seal of the Asterleeds council, but I can't believe <cf>the package is missing: ......
...... Oh?　Dear Adventurer. <cf>I see you have a packing slip.
...... picked it up in Bahamar Highland? <cf>And your luggage had been ransacked by monsters, and...
That could be the <cf>package that is supposed to be delivered to our compound!
Dear Adventurer. <cf>Are you busy?
My husband is in somewhat of a bind. <cf>If you would be so kind as to help us, we would appreciate it.
Once again, my name is Giles, the butler. <cf>Please make my acquaintance.
I serve on the Asterleeds Council <cf>Councilman Dalton.
Did you know?
He has been instrumental in the operation of the <cf>port in Asterleeds!
He himself is keen on trading and trades his goods through <cf>various channels!
However, I haven't received the all-important package. ......
The ship was about to sail, so <cf>all the servants were out looking for it.
The adventurers found <cf>probably the package we're looking for.
Could you please take me to <cf>to that location?
Hurry and head over to <cf>before your luggage gets ransacked again!
Could you please take us to the place where you picked up the <cf>packing slip from " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>"?
This is the package that the adventurer found at <cf>
There is no doubt about it. <cf>It belongs to Congressman Dalton.
I see goblin footprints around ......
I don't see any blood, so <cf>the people who were carrying them must have escaped.
What's left of ......? <cf>Let's have a little look inside, shall we?
This is ...... goblin fur. <cf>No, but there are too many ......
The same is true of this box and that one over there. <cf>They are all materials that can be taken from goblins.
The fact that we got this much means that we <cf>got the same amount of ......
Excuse me, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Would you mind keeping us company a little longer?
There is a warehouse in the port of Asterleeds <cf>owned by Senator Dalton.
I'd like to see what's in there too.
I can open the door to the warehouse. <cf>Let's head for the port of Asterleeds.
Councilman Dalton owns a warehouse at <cf>in the port of Asterleeds.
Let's head over to see what's in the warehouse.
This is Senator Dalton's warehouse. <cf>There should still be a shipment left for the next shipment.
I'm going to go check inside. <cf>Adventurers, please wait here.
[--]Thank you for your patience. <cf>We have gone through all of your belongings.
As I thought, a large amount of monster material was stored at <cf>
Same as the one razed in Bahamar Highland.
Especially goblins, Mooks, and ogres. ...... <cf>Seems to be a lot of subhuman monster stuff.
They must have taken down that many.
I've heard that some adventurers are taking down more subhumans than <cf>necessary to get materials. ......
I was surprised that even the trade route led by Senator Dalton <cf>has been created!
Have you already noticed ......?
I have been sent by a source to Senator Dalton's residence <cf>to investigate his background.
We have seen some suspicious activity regarding the senator's trade.
If Senator Dalton buys materials at a higher price, more people will <cf>bring their materials there!
That's how many monsters will be <cf>taken down!
But do monsters also have to be one-sided <cf>too?
...... Yes, it is. <cf>It's not surprising that they would consider retaliating against humans.
Maybe the reason they ransacked the luggage this time was to get back the bodies of their friends <cf>......
Eventually, this may lead to a major clash between humans and subhumans <cf>
This is not a personal problem for Senator Dalton. <cf>Drastic solutions need to be put in place!
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks for the valuable information.
What you see here is for you to say nothing else.
Sorry to drag you into this, <cf>Adventurer, but please take care of yourself!
We continue to investigate Senator Dalton's background.
Please do not tell anyone in confidence what we saw. <cf>We will not question the Congressman until we have proof.
Hmmm ....... <cf>I wonder what I'm missing: ......
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for consulting me.
Actually, the head chef gave me an assignment.
I need to suggest one dish for our wedding celebration <cf>
So I made a salad and it said <cf>resubmitted
I was told that 'I don't have enough blessings'. <cf>But I have no idea what that means. ......
Yes, I have. Would you adventurers like to try <cf>once?
I'd like to hear from different people. <cf>I will have them ready soon, please!
How about ......?
I would like a little more crunch, is that right? <cf>Yes, the texture may be monotonous.
Blessings...... texture is monotonous....... <cf>...... Oh, I see!
Adventurer, that's it! <cf>I had an inspiration!
Sorry for the short notice. Adventurer. <cf>Could you get me a "Pear Nuts"?
It's a little far away. <cf>It's a nut you can get in Montegnor Valley.
A "Pear Nuts" would complete the salad. <cf>Best regards!
Pear Nuts" are nuts that can be found at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>in the Montegnor Valley.
This would make a wedding-worthy <cf>salad!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>You brought us "Pear Nuts."
Then you can serve the salad at ....... <cf>Now all you need to do is sprinkle some "Pear Nuts" and you're done!
...... Okay. What do you think? <cf>Try it right away!
...... Delicious?　Good! <cf>Thanks to the adventurers!
Pear Nuts" are characterized by the fact that the nuts are packed in such a way that they are nestled <cf>together!
Also, the berries are harvested by tearing them by hand. <cf>
The "Fruit of the Covenant" that brings two people together. ...... <cf>I thought it would be a perfect wedding gift.
The chef was also trying to get this across.
The taste of a dish and the meaning of its ingredients. <cf>If you can't make the most of both, you are not a full-fledged chef.
I need to learn more and more <cf>and this time I need to be able to notice on my own.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I will train more and become a great cook!
Oh, is it smoky?　Sorry. <cf>But this smoke gives it a nice flavor.
It's a smoking gun every time I go to work. <cf>It's also a source of complaints.
I guess what I'm asking you to do is to transport the new kiln. <cf>I'm thinking it's time for a new smoking kiln.
The upcoming kiln is a legacy of Bapharia, and <cf>how they say it can smoke in an instant!
Smoked food is delicious and can be preserved, but <cf>it takes a long time to make.
If you can do that in an instant, it's amazing. <cf>I'd love to try it.
So I've had a friend of mine from before <cf>fix it for me.
I'm a <cf>restorer of Bapharia's heritage named Ciri. I'm an apprentice.
I'm working on it in Larpal and need you to pick up the kiln at <cf>.
I guess I can tell them it's a Paulette request. <cf>It's nice to meet you, Paulette.
I think the kiln needs to get <cf>from Ceili in Larpal.
I guess I'm just looking forward to getting the kiln in the mail.
You're Paulette's messenger. <cf>Smoke kiln, right?　It's ready to be restored.
But it's an unusual legacy, isn't it?
I have a friend of mine named Millene who studies <cf>history.
She says that the Bapharia civilization must have had <cf>tons of food preservation technology.
They don't have to go to the trouble of smoking it.
Either because it was delicious or he made it as a hobby. <cf>He said that's the only reason he could think of.
I can't believe they'd even build a device like this for that. <cf>The Bapharia civilization is really amazing.
Oh, I'm sorry. <cf>I got carried away.
Here's the smoking kiln. Also, I need <cf>a "big kemuri stone" to get it going.
Can you collect that too on your way home and deliver it to <cf>?
You can find them at ' <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>'. <cf>Three of them should be enough, please.
You can find the "Big Kemuri Stone" that moves the kiln at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>
I'm sure you'll get it as you go along when you extract the ore.
When you have finished collecting them, please deliver them to Paulette in Asterleeds along with the <cf>kiln.
Welcome back. <cf>Did you get the kiln from Sheli?
Yeah, this is it. <cf>It's the Bapharia Instant Smoke Kiln.
Oh, even the "Great Kemuri Stone". <cf>You're so thoughtful. Thanks.
I think the first instant smoked one is going to be for <cf>Adventurers.
Which, start up. <cf>Come on, let's go.
<span size="Big">............! &lt;/&gt;
...... Well, that was a hell of a smoke. <cf>Kehoho, kehoho.
Everyone was all over <cf>about whether it was a fire, an eruption, or the roar of a monster attack.
But then I got really pissed off.
It's the smoking that counts. <cf>This one really took a moment.
Paku. ...... Yeah, this is charcoal.
Pfft. I'm not sure if it's the fire or the <cf>smoke level that's messed up.
The only thing that doesn't break on that one is <cf>, but that's Bapharia's legacy.
It's just not working in the city, as you'd expect. <cf>On the other hand, if we start a wildfire, it's too much trouble.
And then there's ...... sea?
I guess if you're in the middle of a big ocean <cf>they might not bother you.
...... would they think you were in distress? <cf>I see. That's a groaner no matter how you look at it.
Anyway, there's room for improvement. <cf>We'll have to talk to Ciri about it again.
Thanks a lot. Thank you for your help. <cf>If you make a delicious smoked fish, we'll share it with you.
Hmmmmmmm... <cf>I'm still making smoked fish today, and it's so kemuri-mokumokumo!
Smokey to the house with delicious smoked food. <cf>No, that might make me a little angry.
I'm going to make it outside.
Hmmm, I still can't catch anything. <cf>It's strange.
I always fish here.
It's a river fish native to the Montegnor Valley. <cf>It's a very powerful fish with a full body of muscle.
They've been up the river all the way from downstream <cf>and they're not afraid to climb waterfalls.
When a big fish is caught, humans are more likely to be dragged <cf>down to the river!
I love to compare strength with muscle fish and catch them. <cf>But lately I haven't been able to do it at all, so it's boring.
I think there's a reason the musclefish can't climb the river. <cf>But it's not safe to go outside the village.
Go to <cf>to see if anything is happening downstream on the river. Please do.
I think there's a reason the musclefish can't make it up the river. <cf>Go check out the river downstream. Please.
The water in the river is swirling in a big swirl. <cf>Something seems to be spinning in the center.
I picked up the spinning metal parts. <cf>The whirlpool disappeared and the musclefish swam out all together.
The parts we picked up seem to be of Bapharia's heritage. <cf>Let's bring them back to Hubby.
Looks like the metal parts were the reason the <cf>muscle fish couldn't climb up the river.
Let's bring it back to Hubby.
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>Look, look. A musclefish came up the river!
Did you find anything?　Let me see. Let me see.
Hmmm. This is what I found in the river. <cf>Parts of Bapharia's heritage, I guess.
It looks like just a few metal plates going around and around. <cf>What good is that going to do?
Like when you make a whirlpool in the bathtub or when you do the laundry? <cf>You can stir the pot with your hands, right?
Oh, maybe it's for training muscle fish! <cf>They make vortexes with these to strengthen the muscles of the muscle fish!
Interesting. I'll show this to my grandpa. <cf>My grandpa is a Bapharia scholar.
Thank you very much! <cf>Here's a fish for you. Take it.
Now, let me challenge you to a game!
Why?　It's obvious!
That's because I'm a Soldier and ...... <cf>you're an adventurer!
Not an answer, you say?　......f
If you want answers, you're going to have to beat me here!
There's been an unusual monster outbreak in the area and a request has been issued to <cf>to take it down.
It's a game to see who can defeat more of them!
First, we're taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Don't be surprised, okay?　I'm already on ......
Nine bodies!　We're taking them down!
Huh. How's that? <cf>If I can take down 10 of them, you win.
I will then admit defeat gracefully and <cf>tell you why I challenged you to a victory!
I'll be here waiting. <cf>A winner always wears a little extra time.
If you can kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_01001"/>in " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>", you win!
Already 9 bodies!　I'm taking them down, I'm <cf>waiting for you here!
What? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_01001"/>...... says he killed 10 of them!
<span size="Big">Ba, you're a monster. ...... &lt;/&gt;
...... Okay, I get it. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_01001"/>I'll concede defeat as far as
And why I challenged you to a match: ....... <cf>Listen to my sad past!
I was born the eldest son of a poor family. <cf>I have always told my six younger brothers that I am the strongest.
It started out as an altruistic lie, <cf>but it became a source of emotional support for my brothers.
My brothers and sisters still believe I'm the strongest <cf>
Hence!　I must be the strongest! <cf>Stronger than anyone else, and solitary!
That's why! <cf>I will not let anything rise above me!
For that, I challenge you to another round! <cf>The next step is to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>!
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_01001"/>is a small checkup. <cf>Don't be surprised. I've already <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>been ......
14 bodies!　We're taking them down!
Huh. ....... How's that? <cf>You know, the only way to beat me is to take down 15 of them.
With a past that cannot be told without tears <cf>I wonder if I can beat this me who has gained true strength!
If you can kill 15 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>in " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>", you win!
Already 14 of them!　I'm the strongest I've ever beaten. <cf>I'll be waiting for you here!
What the hell? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>He said he defeated 15 of them!
<span size="Big">Is there such a guy in this world? ......ッ &lt;/&gt;
Damn ...... but now there are fewer monsters <cf>and people are at peace.
I'll admit it now. You are strong! <cf>The best Soldier I know!
But hey! <cf>I'm not defeated yet!
I am Mino, the strongest and lone Soldier! <cf>We'll settle this sooner or later!
Farewell!　...... and before you go. <cf>Take this.
As a result, I had to help <cf>with a request to take down a monster. That's my reward for that.
You think it's the law?　...... Huff. <cf>Yeah, I'm the strongest man in every way!
The lone Soldier is also the best at paying the bills! <cf>They are not stingy with this kind of thing!
So, once again, farewell!
Well, that was careless. <cf>Our bento is certainly delicious, though.
I didn't think we'd sell enough material <cf>all at once to run out.
So, you. <cf>You're going to get the materials for me. Thanks a lot.
I'll take three "Sweet Mushrooms" and ten <cf>"Fluffy Wheat" please.
I can get it at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland. <cf>I'll be back in a couple of days!
3 <cf>"Sweet Mushrooms" and 10 "Fluffy Wheat" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Highland.
I'm asking you to run a long way!
I see you brought the ingredients for my lunch. <cf>Thank you. You saved me a lot of trouble.
Come again. <cf>We'll be happy to serve you!
Can you take care of that for me? <cf>That would be great. Hee-hee-hee.
Oh, this laughing is just a quirk. <cf>Don't worry about it. Hee-hee.
This is the first magic potion anyone in the world has ever made. <cf>If it works, I'll share it with you, okay?
What we are missing now are 5 "Centipede Fossils". <cf>And five "Xaremodros Fruits".
It's a common ingredient in doctors' medications. <cf>These guys are nothing suspicious.
You can find me at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" in Bahamar Highland. <cf>Well then, good luck. baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
To make a magic potion, five "centipede fossils" are needed.
Five "Kusaremodros fruits" are missing.
You can find them at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" in Bahamar Highland.
Nice to meet you. Hee-hee-hee.
Good work. <cf>I see you brought the ingredients for the medicine.
Yes, yes, this is it. <cf>The Centipede Fossil and the Xaremodros Fruit.
Let's boil it right away, shall we? <cf>Hmm?　What kind of medicine am I going to make?
...... It's a secret between us, okay?
I'm working on <cf>an ancient potion that can transform you into someone else.
I found an old document in our warehouse. Hee-hee. <cf>Interesting, right?　I wanted to make it.
We're still in the prototype stage. <cf>I may ask you to procure something else.
I'll look forward to working with you then. <cf>Let's aim for completion together. Baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon
Can you take care of it? <cf>I'll be saved.
The material for the new weapon is <cf>15 pieces of "[copper nitrate]".
Look for it at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" in Bahamar Highland. <cf>You will find it without much trouble.
I'm counting on you. Nice to meet you.
Look for me at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>' in Bahamar Highland.
I look forward to working with you
It's a good "copper nitrate". <cf>Thank you.
Sorry I'm not very sociable. <cf>I'm just not a smooth talker by any stretch of the imagination.
It's been hard on my family. <cf>I just want to show them a good eye once in a while.
I'm just trying to make a buck with a new weapon and <cf>make it a little easier for you.
Thanks to you, I'm going to make a good weapon. <cf>Thanks again.
My daily lunch box is <cf>It's all about variety and nutrition.
Today's dish turned out well, but I wanted a little more color. <cf>But I wanted to add a little more color.
Can you bring me 15 "red ball beans" <cf>?
There's a <cf>growing at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>in Montegnor Valley. Don't drop them on the way!
15 <cf>"Red Ball Beans" from " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" in Montegnor Valley. Please.
Oh, they are "red ball beans". <cf>They're curled up nice.
The cleaner the circle, the better <cf>these beans taste.
Around Litze, <cf>I hear they roll off the mountain sometimes.
Now I can make a convincing lunch box. <cf>Thanks!
Hey, welcome. <cf>You ordered a makeover potion?　You're right, it's not ready yet.
Don't panic, baboon. <cf>First you need to mix the base drug, and then...
That's why I need your help again.
It's a secret medicine-making business. <cf>You can only ask someone who knows what's going on. Hee-hee-hee.
I need eight "fir bark" and five <cf>"freshwater marlin fins."
It is an ingredient in medicines that is very effective as a tonic. <cf>But good quality is hard to find.
I trust your eyes. <cf>You can get it at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>in Montegnor Valley.
I'll be waiting for you. <cf>I'll be waiting for you. Hee-hee-hee.
All you need is <cf>You can get it at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in Montegnor Valley.
Eight "fir bark" and five <cf>"freshwater marlin fins."
Did you get your "fir bark" and "freshwater sailfish fins" at <cf>?　Hee hee hee.
You've collected some pretty good quality stuff. <cf>Baboon, let's get to mixing.
You say your nose is about to bend? <cf>I like this scent. Hee-hee.
I'm trying to transform myself into someone else. <cf>We should at least put up with the smell.
However, we are still in the preparation stage. <cf>We have a long way to go, but I'm sure we'll get some more help.
Mixing is not something that can be done overnight. <cf>Be patient, be patient. Hee-hee-hee!
I was rummaging through the Pioneer Bureau's archives and found <cf>a new way to manufacture weapons.
No, it is older in chronological order. <cf>The technique dates from when Asterleeds was independent.
That's about 400 years ago. <cf>I heard that the succession of technology has been lost.
But if you look it up, it still says <cf>that it might still be passable.
Thought you might like to give it a try.
The materials needed are 5 pieces of "[Kosatetsu]" and <cf>15 pieces of "Noirstone".
The material itself is still available. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
Montegnor Valley's " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" at <cf>If you're looking for it, you'll find it.
You'll find <cf>at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>' in Montegnor Valley.
I look forward to working with you.
Kosatetsu" and "Noirstone"? <cf>You did a good job collecting them.
It's a good stone. <cf>But I've never used it for blacksmithing before.
I wonder what will happen. <cf>Let's try following the literature first.
Thanks, man. <cf>Stop by again if you want.
You seem to have good skills and I trust you.
Thank you for undertaking this. <cf>It was difficult to do the research in Berkmar: ......
Yes, it is. This is the city that was recently destroyed by the Avaritia disaster <cf>
I'm told that there is a <cf>[oral tradition (kuden)] there that was declared heretical by the Bapharia religion.
That content is a bit of a problem.
<span size="Big">How to "Join the Monster's Gang"&lt;/&gt;.
I've been told that ......
Of course, such a thing is heretical from the Bapharia point of view! <cf>That's what they say!
But it might give us a clue <cf>to the monster's ecology, right?
As a pioneering bureau, we should not be afraid of talking about it. <cf>We should investigate it more and more!　We think it's a good idea!
I'd like to gather some information quickly, preferably before the Bapharians get a look at <cf>
I know there is a Bapharia pilgrimage group in Berkmahal <cf>that conducts memorial services.
They have some Berkmar residents there.
From that person ...... who used to live in Berkmar <cf>could you please talk to me about oral history
On the oral tradition of "To Join the Monsters"
I'm in Berkmar <cf>Could we hear from a former resident?
Hmm, what is it? <cf>Am I a resident of Berkmar?
Yes, I was born in Berkmar. <cf>But lately I've been traveling a lot.
I also learned about the city being crushed by Avaritia <cf>from people on the road.
So I don't know what you're talking about, avaritia and all. <cf>I'll listen to you if you still want.
...... Okay, so it's oral research. <cf>Maybe it's my grandma.
My grandma used to speak a strange language. <cf>It's different from any other language in the world, and I don't know what it means.
But I've seen grandma use it to placate <cf>monsters.
I was taught that word too. <cf>But they also told me not to use it in public too much.
It would be creepy to talk to a monster. <cf>You don't even know if you really get what you're talking about.
Grandma?　She died a few years ago.
I wonder if he would have <cf>gotten rid of Avaritia too if she was still alive.
...... Hey, you. <cf>While I'm teaching you, why don't you help me?
There's a nappo near here. <cf>I'd like to try the words I know on him.
Now that grandma's gone <cf>I'm the only one who knows those words.
If I can learn to use that language <cf>maybe I can save the city this time!
You want to know more about oral traditions? <cf>Then come with me.
I'll actually use it right in front of you. <cf>In return, you'll have to escort me.
You want to know more about oral traditions, don't you?
There's a nappo near here. <cf>I'd like to test my knowledge of the language on him.
Take care of the bodyguards.
Oh ......, I found Nappo. <cf>Now, let's see if you can understand my grandma's words.
If it's a nappo, it's no big deal if it gets out of control. <cf>Okay, let's give it a try right away.
<span size="Big">......ッ!　......, ......ッ! &lt;/&gt;
Strange pronunciation, right? <cf>I had a hard time with it at first, too.
It's a little tricky. <cf>It's more like turning your throat upside down. ......
Hey, look, look, look! <cf>I think Nappo just spotted us.
<span size="Big">......!　............? &lt;/&gt;
All right, all right. <cf>Then we'll just keep going over there.
<span size="Big">......?　......!　......! &lt;/&gt;
<span size="Big">......?　......~~♪&lt;/&gt;
No, no! <cf>Don't come over here!
Over there. Over there. There you go. There you go.
Hmmm, what a fun dance.
It doesn't look like they're going to attack you.
that (something mentioned before which is distant psychologically or in terms of time)
...... I fell asleep.
You're not talking to me at all. <cf>Let's go back to ......
Let's go back to where we were. <cf>Sorry for wasting your time. ......
Thanks for your efforts. <cf>You couldn't get Nappo to talk through it. ......
If it works, <cf>I wanted to try it on some other monsters.
Grandma really could have done it.
That's what they were doing, even the goblins were doing what they said. <cf>We were letting them go over there quietly.
I thought I could handle <cf>if I was a nappo.
But what was wrong with what you said earlier? <cf>I thought I told you to go over there.
Hmmm. I knew it was impossible to get rid of monsters <cf>just by oral tradition.
What?　You said <span size="Big">the Bureau of Reclamation is looking into the oral tradition&lt;/&gt;?
What the heck, you can say that first!
If you were from the Pioneer Bureau, you might know more <cf>about a lot of things!
Please. Introduce me to this person! <cf>I want to know more about this oral tradition.
Accepted a request in Larpal? <cf>Then take me with you as you report back!
I need to know more about this oral tradition!
While you're reporting in, take me to the <cf>pioneer station guy in Larpal!
Hey adventurers, thanks for your hard work. <cf>How would you like to investigate the oral history of Berkmar?
What?　You brought the person who passed down the oral tradition? <cf>Yes, I understand. I'd like to talk to him.
<span size="Big">......!　......!　......? &lt;/&gt;
...... How's that going? <cf>I know this is the oral word.
...... I see. <cf>I think I understand a little.
Really?　What did that just mean? <cf>Tell me!
Oh, sorry, the meaning is a bit ....... <cf>But it's pronounced like Goblin or Mook.
And the way you vocalize.
Maybe the oral tradition is the very word of <cf>monster!
If you use it to talk to monsters <cf>I can see how Bapharia could be considered heretical.
Oh come on. My grandma ain't no monster, and <cf>ain't exactly on the side of monsters.
No, of course I understand that. <cf>Words are good for us.
Knowing the language of monsters has nothing to do with <cf>being on their side!
Rather, we must thank <cf>grandmother for leaving us her precious words!
Because if you use this language well <cf>you may not have to fight the monsters.
Mr. Raboli. <cf>Would you like to work at the Pioneer Station if you like?
I think the words you passed down orally should be <cf>studied properly
That's a good thing! <cf>I wish I knew how to use that word.
I want to talk to monsters like my grandma and <cf>help people.
Done. <cf>Well then, I look forward to working with you.
Thank you so much. <cf>It made the survey very informative!
I am glad we asked you to help us. <cf>Please continue to help our pioneering bureau.
Thanks for accepting my strange request. <cf>We're not sure it's a dead body yet. ......
Actually, my friend and I were on our way to Litze when <cf>we got attacked by a monster.
I was saved because that guy covered for me. <cf>But I don't know what happened to him. ......
Please. Find my friend Yoan, the adventurer!
It would be best if we could find that guy, but ....... <cf>I don't care if it's just a clue. At least something ......
That guy was getting married. ...... <cf>Damn. ...... How did this happen? ......
Yoan's guy always wore a bandana. <cf>His fiancée complimented him on it.
The place where we got separated was Montegnor Valley. <cf>I believe it was near the waterfall on the "Ritze Tradeway".
There must be something left in that area. <cf>Stay safe ...... Yoan ......!
Montegnor Valley "Ritze Tradeway" <cf>I think we got separated near a waterfall.
I don't care if it's just a clue. At least something ......
I found a torn bandana.
It may have belonged to an adventurer named Yoan. <cf>I can't find anything else of interest.
Let's have Girsch check the bandana.
Deliver the bandana to Girsch in Larpal <cf>to see if it belongs to Joanne.
It's you. <cf>What?　I found your bandana!
Let me see!
This is a ...... ain't no mistake. <cf>It's Yoan's bandana.
That's the one I was winding up with that day. <cf>Oh yeah. ...... it was falling down a waterfall. ......
Yoan wasn't there, was he? <cf>I knew it was a bad idea. ...... I knew it. ......
You don't know yet?　Maybe. <cf>Yoan's a tough guy.
Yeah, ......, that's right. I'm not giving up hope. <cf>But we need to be clear.
Joan's fiancée is in Minsterhorn, apparently. <cf>I'll tell you all about it and get my head out of my ass.
There's no way they'll forgive me, though. ...... <cf>At the very least, it's my responsibility to get the word out.
Thank you. <cf>You've given me the courage to take the plunge.
If you hear Yoan's name anywhere <cf>let me know. See ya.
Haha, haha ....... <cf>I managed to escape this far: ......
Oh, but! <cf>I can't believe they took that thing!
If we don't do this, <cf>there will be another victim of the curse: ......
Small items and accessories scattered about.
Rather than a lost and found ......, <cf>looks more like the remains of someone ransacking the place.
There may be merchants who have had their goods stolen. <cf>If I see him, I will deliver it to him.
Ha, ha ....... <cf>Totally, what a day.
...... Oh, that! <cf>An accessory you have!
It was taken from me by bandits. <cf>You picked it up on the street?　Okay, thanks.
But that thing doesn't seem to be there. ...... <cf>The bandits must have taken it.
Sorry. While you're at it, <cf>I have one more favor to ask. May I?
Once again, my name is Bessemer. <cf>I'm a peddler.
I was attacked by bandits on the street earlier. <cf>They took our goods.
You picked it up and delivered it to me. <cf>Thank you very much.
It's just ...... something I just can't lose <cf>and it hasn't come back.
It's a black box that fits in both hands. <cf>Inside is the Necklace of the Damned.
It's a necklace with a legend that whoever gets it will have a bad day <cf>
It may sound silly, but the curse is real.
I've experienced it firsthand. <cf>I've been caught with forgeries, the ship I was on sank, and more. ......
So I decided to dedicate my necklace to the Bapharia religion <cf>
Then, on the way there, they were attacked by bandits. <cf>Maybe this is another curse of the necklace.
Perhaps the necklace was taken by the bandits.
Please. <cf>Please help me get my necklace back!
The bandits have fled towards Asterleeds. <cf>But they must not have left Bahamar Highland yet.
I think you can find it if you look for "Divine Haven Hill". <cf>Especially around the border with Asteria Plain.
Let's get going right away. <cf>Before the curse of the necklace falls on someone else.
The bandit who took the necklace must not have left <cf>Bahamar Highland yet.
I think if you look for <cf>on the border of Divine Haven Hill and Asteria Plain, you'll find it.
Let's hurry, before the curse falls on someone else.
Who are you ......? <cf>That's the merchant from ...... beside you, isn't it?
I'm sure of it. It's the bandit who attacked me and took <cf>my luggage.
But it's such a wreck and ....... <cf>What in the world happened to it?
I found an expensive looking necklace among the loot. <cf>I was delighted to see that it must be a good one. ......
I was suddenly rammed by a rumblebore. <cf>How did it get here ......
I knew it. ......
That necklace has a curse on it that makes whoever gets it <cf>unhappy.
Oh, you ......!　 <cf>What the hell are you selling?
It's not a commodity. <cf>It was going to be dedicated to the temple.
So, where's the necklace?
I got caught in the fangs of a rumblebore and <cf>took it with me.
Damn, I didn't think he was that bad. <cf>I'll give you back everything I took!　Take it!
Where's Rumble Bore? <cf>He ran toward the cliff!
It's right there. It went down from there. <cf>You can follow the rest on your own!
Let's hurry up and go. <cf>Hope I can get it back this time: ......
According to the bandits, Rumblebore should be under the cliffs at <cf>"Divine Haven Hill"
The cursed necklace is there too. <cf>Let's hurry up and go there.
This is the rumblebore that attacked the bandit. <cf>His necklace is caught in his fangs.
Looks like he hit this tree and <cf>died.
But you fell off that cliff <cf>and happened to hit this tree ......
What a horrible necklace <cf>to have misfortune befall an animal!
...... Okay, I finally collected it. <cf>Now let's get it to the Bapharia cult.
The temple in Asterleeds is good. <cf>There, they can purify this necklace.
The question is, what misfortunes will happen <cf>until we get there ......
You. Can I ask you to escort me for a little while longer? <cf>As far as the temple in Asterleeds, thank you.
Can I ask for an escort to the temple in Asterleeds?
What misfortunes will happen to you before you get to <cf>......
We've arrived at ......!
Thank goodness. I've got a cursed necklace to wear <cf>I was wondering what would happen along the way.
With you, strangely enough, <cf>nothing happened.
I wonder why?　Maybe you have some kind of <cf>power that could quell the curse.
At any rate, I was able to carry it safely. <cf>Now I, too, am free from the curse.
No one will be struck by misfortune anymore. <cf>I will never forget this favor. Thank you!
Come on, just one more step. <cf>I'll go it alone from here on out.
Don't worry. <cf>Once you've come this far, nothing more will happen to you!
Fugiaaaa!
Wow, the cat that stepped on my tail attacked me!
Cahrrrrr!
Sorry, sorry, miko! <cf>A hand happened to grab my chest and ......!
Where are you touching? <cf>[You insolent!　Get back there!
No, no, no..!
Thank you for listening to me. <cf>Mr. Adventurer.
My name is Tria. <cf>I was evacuated from Berkmar.
Yes, I am. It was during the Avaritia disaster.
That's when my sister left her favorite <cf>stuffed animal behind.
That guy, he's always been worried about that. ...... <cf>I've lost all my energy.
Could you please go to Bergmar and look for my <cf>sister's stuffed animal?
This is a pink Uribo plush toy. <cf>It is so rare that we think there is only one!
If it hadn't been for that <cf>we would still be having fun playing ......
...... Oh, I'm sorry! <cf>I know it's just something you have to say to an adventurer.
There is a priest at Berkmar <cf>praying for us!
He may be able to tell us more about the village and what's left <cf>
Please give me your best regards. <cf>I'd like to cheer up my sister as much as possible.
The priest of Berkmar might be able to tell us more about <cf>
Please, please, please.
You must be an adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you here?
This is a place of tragic tragedy. <cf>Many have been laid to rest.
Please refrain from disturbing their peace at <cf>
...... at the request of a boy who lived here? <cf>Oh, that's right. Sorry about that.
Forgive my rudeness. <cf>My name is Innaat, a priest of Bapharia.
We pray for the peace of those who sleep in Berkmar and <cf>our mission is to maintain tranquility
Still, I admire you. <cf>I didn't realize you came all the way out here to find a stuffed animal.
The peace of mind of a young child is <cf>more precious than anything else.
I have an idea where the stuffed animals are.
It seems that goblins trashed <cf>the place before we got here!
I suspect the stuffed animal was taken along with the belongings <cf>
You can find them by looking for goblin dens. <cf>In the "Soundless Foothills" you will find the "Settlement of Troubles."
If you would like, you can retrieve the people's belongings as well. <cf>We will repay you accordingly.
The "pink Uribo stuffed animal" you're looking for may have been taken by <cf>goblins.
If you look for the "Settlement of Troubles" in "Soundless Foothills," you'll find it at <cf>
If you would, please retrieve the people's belongings as well.
Mixed in with the jewelry and precious metals <cf>is a pink stuffed Uribo.
I got back the stuffed animals that the people of Berkmar left behind and <cf>requested.
Deliver the relics to Innate in Berkmar at <cf>
I got back the relics and <cf>the "pink Uribo stuffed animal".
I see that you found the relics of the people of Berkmar at <cf>
Wonderful. Thank you <cf>I'm glad to have found a good man like you.
These are offered at the altar of mourning for those who have passed away. <cf>Hopefully, they will lead us to God.
And you mentioned that this Uribo stuffed animal still has an <cf>owner.
A boy named Tria and his sister. <cf>It's a small thing, but it will be a beacon of hope.
Please deliver them.
Thank you for finding these artifacts.
The Uribo stuffed animal was given to its owner, a boy named <cf>Tria, and his sister.
You really found it? <cf>That's amazing. I didn't know such a thing was possible!
Thank goodness ......! <cf>It's his stuffed animal.
This was a gift from my parents. <cf>Now it's a ...... memento, though.
Avaritia attacked me. <cf>They're both gone.
But there are people like you who can help. <cf>And we've returned some memories.
It's been hard, but <cf>I'm going to stay strong with my sister from now on.
Thank you so much. <cf>I will never forget this.
Ah~. <cf>It's a beautiful day~!
The sun is shining and the clouds are big. <cf>Why am I making deliveries on a day like this?
Hey, it's a beautiful day! <cf>Thanks for taking care of the delivery.
I'm one of those people who, when I'm distracted by something <cf>, I can't see what's going on around me.
I was looking at the clouds before and I fell into the <cf>ocean with a bunch of letters in my arms.
Oh no, I was so mad. <cf>Wouldn't it be a disaster if it happened again?
That's why on a nice day like this <cf>I don't force myself to deliver.
So, yes. <cf>Here's the package we're delivering.
Of course, you can get all the delivery charges from <cf>you can get them for me.
They're all near the transfer portal, so you're better off using the portal than walking to <cf>
Well then, nice to meet you. <cf>Ah~~ It's really a beautiful day~~!
The first delivery address is <cf>near the Arena's transfer portal~!
Oh~~ I feel so good <cf>I'm getting sleepy!
Oh, you're late!
I've been waiting for this. This is it! <cf>A newspaper with predictions for the next match.
...... Hmmm. Good! <cf>Now that's one big hole in the ground and a big win!
Thanks!
Hmm?　Are you wondering where to go next? <cf>Come to think of it, I haven't seen you around.
Let me see a little. <cf>Which one? ......
Looks like the next one is near the beach transfer portal. <cf>Good luck!
Ah, I've been waiting. Sun Oil. <cf>Thanks for delivering it!
You've got to take precautions against sunburn. <cf>You'd better be careful too.
Let's go swimming then. <cf>I'm going to have fun today!
Oh?　You want to know where <cf>is the nearest portal to your next delivery address?　You must be new!
Let's see, <cf>Next, it looks like the transfer portal in front of the Bapharia temple is close.
Ahh ...... <cf>Quick, I need to apply some sun oil!
It's for me! <cf>I've been waiting for you!
You got this from the main temple of the Duchy of Bernhardt, didn't you? <cf>Ho-ho-ho!　Finally, I can go back to my home country!
I was sick and tired of being thrown <cf>into a temple that was just this big and had no tradition or prestige.
It was worth the effort to flatter the upper management. <cf>Let's see, let's get started: ......
............ What? <cf>Hey, hey, hey, what the hell?
Transferred to Litze: ...... That, that dreadful place! <cf>This eagle!
No, it's not true!　I am a vessel <cf>that will eventually become a chief priest ...... as I continue to rise in the main temple!
That's the kind of ...... such as a leftward shift to the countryside! <cf>Such ...... such ......!
<span size="Big">Oh no, that's ridiculous aaaaahhh! &lt;/&gt;
What are you looking at me like that for? <cf>Is it so funny that I was left behind?
...... What?　No?　You mean where you're going to make your next delivery? <cf>Hmmm... ......
I can't help it, I'm not in the mood, but ...... <cf>I'm like a new face. Special.
The next one seems to be near the transfer portal at the Celestial Monument Plaza.
............ Huh. You're going to ...... left? <cf>No, I won't lose!　I won't lose!
Oh, Mr. Deliveryman. <cf>We've been expecting you.
Yes, this envelope. <cf>Thanks for delivering it.
This is a boarding ticket for a liner. <cf>I accidentally left it at home.
I panicked and had my daughter drive me home. <cf>I'm glad I made it in time.
Did you know?　From Asterleeds, <cf>there are regular sailings to various regions.
It's nice and relaxing to take a boat trip. <cf>If you have the chance, do it!
Well then, you have a nice trip.
Oh?　Are you having trouble with your delivery address? <cf>Asterleeds is a big place.
Let's see ...... <cf>It looks like the portal to the "Turning Wheel Pavilion" is close by!
have a good day
You're the delivery guy. <cf>Thank you very much.
Sorry for the big baggage. <cf>I just couldn't resist buying all the groceries.
Asterleeds has everything you need, vegetables, meat, fish, <cf>
The seafood is especially fresh and delicious! <cf>The harbor market is worth a visit!
Oh, no. I just stood there and talked. <cf>I've got to get started on the food.
If you're hungry, stop by our store!
Oh, hey. What's up?　Where's your next delivery? <cf>Oh, you must be lost.
It's addressed like this: ...... <cf>Looks like it's around the Asterleeds harbor portal.
Good luck with your work too!
Oh, the letter ......! <cf>I'm glad, thank you!
I've been waiting for this for a long time. ...... <cf>Thank goodness. You got it right.
My guy is an adventurer <cf>and right now he's on a continent across the ocean.
It's so far away <cf>it takes days for the letter to reach me.
And of course, the reply. <cf>We just have to wait and hope he's okay.
Actually, it would be best if you came back <cf>......
Oh, I'm sorry. You went to the trouble of delivering it to me. <cf>Thank you. I'll read it with care.
Yes?　Oh, you're looking for a delivery place. <cf>It looks like the next delivery address is near Coin Pavilion.
It's faster if you use the forwarding portal. <cf>Get them to the people who are waiting for them as soon as possible.
Hmm?　A letter for me? <cf>That's unusual.
I wonder who it is. <cf>....... From my son and his wife.
They call me every once in a while. <cf>It's nice to hear from an old man.
Which, I'll prepare a reply. <cf>I'll have to ask Lindsay to write on my behalf again.
You should take care of your family, too. <cf>Even a single letter would make me happy.
No, thank you. <cf>Come to think of it, I'm not the Herit that always comes.
You were assigned to deliver it. That must have been hard work.
Oh, I see you just ran out of letters, too. <cf>Why don't you go complain to Herritt about it?
Hey, good night~! <cf>I see you delivered everything.
Thank you very much. <cf>As promised, the delivery charge is yours. Yes, sir.
Transfer portals are convenient, aren't they? <cf>It's a quick and easy way to travel far away from home.
It's used outside of Asterleeds, so <cf>you should look for it everywhere you go.
Use it well and Quick Cooldown. <cf>But be careful not to get lost.
I'll see you later. I'm going home. <cf>I got sleepy looking at the sky.
Huh~~ah. <cf>I don't feel like working tomorrow~~.
That smells great. <cf>Smells really good.
But I can't eat very much ....... <cf>Still, I can't stop eating it: ......
But, but ...... oh no! <cf>I can't be very brave.
<span size="Big">GWAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! &lt;/&gt;
Mi, mi ...... water ......! <cf>Water, give me water! ......
Ah, water, the root of all cooking: ......! <cf>I had forgotten how precious it is: ......
Is that taste meant to remind <cf>people of the greatness of water ......?
Looks like the fainted cook was wiggled to the doctor at <cf>
He kept repeating ["]water, water ["]" as if he was mumbling. <cf>What on earth did he say? ......
Hey, hey, there is a diet that is super efficient! <cf>Do you know it?
Eat spicy food and sweat! <cf>What better way to lose weight while tasting great?
Hmmm... ...... but you know what? <cf>I can't stop sweating cold sweat from a while ago.
I'm fine with spicy food! <cf>I thought you were ......
The woman who fainted <cf>appears to have been wiggled to a doctor.
He was sweating so much that his face turned blue. <cf>What in the world did he say? ......
Alright......! <cf>Let's keep the peace in the city today!
It's a good, cheap place to eat! <cf>I always get pumped up when I eat there!
I'm just a little too much in! <cf>I'm on fire today!
My body was so hot that I was burning up--
<span size="Big">Ugh, goof! &lt;/&gt;
Looks like the soldier who fainted was <cf>being carried to the doctor.
I was too excited to keep my eyes open. <cf>What in the world did he say? ......
You're an adventurer, right? <cf>I have a favor to ask you.
I actually fell in love with a woman at first sight. ...... <cf>I'm trying to get close to her somehow.
But I really need to <cf>do something for that.
Yeah, thanks for taking it on!
Her name is Aleni. She is the owner of the restaurant there. <cf>She's also a chef famous for her spicy food.
Here, listen carefully. <cf>You can hear the voices of those who have eaten her food.
Oh, anggyaaaaahhhh! <cf>It's too spicy, too spicy!
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ！！！！ <cf>But I can't stop eating it!
...... That's the scream of a customer. <cf>Very hard to believe they're eating food, isn't it?
What?　You said it looks like the people in town ate it too? <cf>And they all passed out? ......
That's right. To get close to Aleni, you have to be able to <cf>eat her food.
But I don't like spicy food. <cf>I can't even put this in my mouth.
Then I heard a rumor. <cf>There is a drug that makes you not feel any kind of pain!
But it seems to be a medicine for adventurers <cf>and they won't sell it to a regular guy like me.
Please. I need you to go get some medicine for me.
A druggist named Danae in Minsterhorn <cf>is supposed to be making that medicine.
Of course I'll pay for it. <cf>I'll be waiting for you. I'm asking you!
The medicine to make it less spicy is supposed to be made by a medicine man in Minsterhorn <cf>named Danae.
I'll pay for it, I ask you!
Welcome, adventurers. <cf>Are you in need of medicine?
Is it a drug that makes it less painful? <cf>Yes, I have it. Please wait.
This way. <cf>Please eat "Mean Jelly" with this medicine.
The ingredients of the drug act on your taste buds and <cf>make you feel less spicy.
If you are sensitive to spiciness, increase the amount of jelly. <cf>Five "Mean Jellies". I think that should do the trick.
Just to be sure, I'd like to ask <cf>what kind of usage are you thinking of?
It's dangerous if it's used in a way it's not supposed to be used. <cf>We check it when we sell you the drug.
...... I see. I'd like to try Mr. Areni's cooking.
I know about Aleni's very spicy food. <cf>This is not the first time I have ordered something like this.
However, even with this medication, ......
No, I don't think it is for me to say any more. <cf>It's all right in terms of usage. Please take it.
You can get "Miin Jelly" from <cf>Miin's nest in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress, Additional Survey". Take care.
It was Mr. Bosch who asked for the medicine, wasn't it? <cf>Please deliver them to him along with "Mean Jelly".
You can get <cf>"Miin Jelly" by defeating Miin's nest in "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress, Additional Survey". Take care.
This is the medicine that makes it less painful! <cf>Thank you, how can I thank you?
With this, even the hottest food is nothing. <cf>You can talk to Areni!
I'll get a drink and go into the store right away! <cf>Oh, I'm so excited!
Huh ......
Oh, you ....... <cf>Will you listen to me?
I could have eaten Areni's food. <cf>I could have eaten it. ......
I didn't find it tasty at all.
I took a bite and understood right away. <cf>Her food tastes good because it's spicy.
That's the best part. <cf>That's why everyone was crazy about her cooking.
I didn't even know that.
In my desperation to eat <cf>I've ruined the taste of food for people I love.
You cheated and you got the bee's knees. <cf>I couldn't even look her in the eye.
I'm sorry you had to go through the trouble of cooperating with me. <cf>But you made me realize something important.
Next time I'll train my palate properly <cf>and tell her with all my heart that it was ["]delicious["]!
You've been an eye-opener. <cf>Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Adventurer! <cf>I need your help with my chickens!
Hey, I brought chickens from <cf>Minsterhorn for wholesale here at the market!
But when I took my eyes off the road for a moment, I was attacked by <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>
The chickens are so excited <cf>they've all run away!
Please! <cf>Save my chickens!
Oh, where have Anne and Alice and Bonnie and Victoria gone <cf>where have they gone ......
What?　Who else is going to help me? <cf>No, there's no one else.
Now that's a chicken's name. <cf>It's only natural to give it a proper name.
Yes, I did!　I told those kids to go to <cf>home if anything happened to them.
I'm going back to Minsterhorn! <cf>Maybe some of them are back!
We want adventurers to come too. <cf>If you see them on the road, let me know.
Oh, my Anne, Bonnie, and Victoria: ......
I'm going back to Minsterhorn first, but I'd like <cf>adventurers to come too!　Please.
Hey, adventurer, you're here. <cf>Nobody's back in the chicken coop.
I guess the adventurers didn't get much, either. <cf>This has turned out to be a messy affair.
I bet those kids are still being chased around <cf>on <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>turf!
Adventurer. <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>I want you to defeat the <cf>and rescue those kids!
In fact, just now, an energetic girl named Elsie <cf>was listening to my story.
I was just yelling, "[Don't let Landfox the]"! ["]] and then he just ran off at <cf>
I hope you can help that girl, too. <cf>I'm sure she's scared, surrounded by monsters.
A girl named Elsie <cf>["]Land Fox the Forgiving! ["]"] and yelling.
He just ran off. <cf>He couldn't have gone that far.
I want you to help her, too.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Are you by any chance a request from Mr. Machey?
You know that, don't you?　 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>has been bullying Mr. Chicken.
I can't believe they would eat off such a cute and tasty chicken <cf>without even judging it!
You don't even know how to lose a head ...... or how to skin ...... <cf>or how to drain blood!
There is no mercy from the God of Bapharia!
<span size="Big">Landfox the Forgiving! &lt;/&gt;
Let's split up and take them down! <cf>If each person kills 20, the chickens will be safe!
Eh?　Yes, I'll go and defeat them too. <cf>It's a piece of cake when you think of Mr. Chicken.
We'll meet back here when we're done. <cf>Here we go!　All for the chickens!
Beasts that have never been kept by man! <cf>You should be aware of the difference in the weight of your meat!
If you take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>around here <cf>20 of them at a time, your chickens will be safe!
We will meet back here when we are done!
Good job, adventurers! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>You were able to defeat the
It's perfect on my part. <cf>Any danger?　No, there was nothing dangerous.
Think of the chickens. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>What a scrap of meat shredded mince!
We were able to save the chickens safely! <cf>Thanks to the adventurers. Thank you very much.
It's all right now, chicken. <cf>I know it was scary being chased.
They don't even know how to handle a chicken. <cf>We've defeated the rowdies.
Your heads will be chopped off cleanly by <cf>me without any pain!
Ha!　I shouldn't, I shouldn't. <cf>My feelings got the better of me.
They are very healthy looking and colorful <cf>chickens.
I am sure they were raised with a lot of love. <cf>Lovely!　Looks delicious!
Come on, let's get back to <cf>and give it back to Mr. Machey!
Oh, lovely chickens! <cf>I want to eat them!
Let's give it back to Mr. Machey of Minsterhorn at <cf>!
Oh, you guys! <cf>I'm glad to hear you're all right!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>You are our benefactor!
Thank you, young lady. <cf>Looks are deceiving, right?
You're such a fine adventurer <cf>for such a face. Nice to see you here.
No, not anymore!　I am a butcher! <cf>I am not an adventurer!
Why does everyone treat me like an <cf>adventurer every time they see me?
["]We would love to have your help in defeating the monsters! ["]] or <cf>["]It is a loss to the world to let that arm sleep! ["]"] and so on.
You're all over the <cf>place towards normal girls.
I don't want to fight with monsters! <cf>I don't want to do that!
Is that so? <cf>Well, don't be modest.
This one is a thank you. Thank you. <cf>Adventurers, if you ever need help again, we'll be happy to help.
That's why I'm not! <cf>I am not an adventurer!
Huovi's guy.... <cf>I'm just glad I'm a full time employee. ......
I'm going to finish my assignments and graduate from <cf>apprenticeship!
Hello adventurers. <cf>Is Enhance Imagine helping you?
I have a favor to ask of <cf>adventurers today regarding Battle Imagine.
I have an assignment coming up from the institute.
A course assignment to explain Battle Imagine and <cf>a practical assignment to actually craft the Imagine.
I'd like to review it before the show. <cf>Adventurer, can you hang out with me for a bit?
Well then, let's start with the training.
I'm sure you've used it many times, adventurer, but <cf>Battle Imagine is a great help in battle.
Like weapons, these can be crafted by collecting <cf>materials.
Check out the Imagine recipe you're looking for. <cf>And make good use of your wish list.
And there's one material that's <cf>essential to the crafting of Battle Imagine.
That's the Idea.
It's a little crystal that combines engrams with will, memory, and the movement of the mind. <cf>It's the core of Battle Imagine.
Ideas can be found in many places, but <cf>they are often obtained by defeating monsters!
Once you have the materials, go to the Imagine Institute counter at <cf>and request a craft!
Then you will get Battle Imagine! <cf>Then you can use it to your heart's content!
Fuu: ....... <cf>I wonder if this is what you mean about the course
Next up is practical skills. I'll have to do the actual crafting at <cf>I'll have to work on my own.
I need to get a good look at <cf>the actual Battle Imagine before I do it.
So, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you show me "B-Pink Uribo"?
I don't care if you craft it, find it in a treasure chest, or <cf>any way you get it.
Help me to pass!　Please!
I need you to get a copy of "B-Pink Uribo" and show it to me at <cf>
I just wanted to make sure I had a good <cf>look at the real thing before I did the practical assignment.
Whether you craft it, find it in a treasure chest, or <cf>any way you can, please!
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Did you get "B-Pink Uribo"?
Oh, you brought it with you. <cf>Well, let me take a look.
Let's see, ...... Hmm, I see. <cf>Here's how it looks like: ......
Wow, so much engrams at ....... <cf>Huh?　This one is not what I thought it was: ......
Wow, I'm glad I saw it after all! <cf>Thanks, adventurer!
That was very helpful. <cf>Now all I have to do is to try to make it on my own.
Oh, yeah!　Don't forget that Battle Imagine has <cf>abilities too!
Because the same type of Battle Imagine may have different effects on <cf>abilities.
I'd recommend finding the Imagine that works best for you and using <cf>.
Well then, I hope you find Imagine useful in your adventures. <cf>If you need anything else, you can always come to the institute.
Someday I'll be a full time employee and I'll repay you <cf>adventurers!
Hello, adventurer. <cf>How's Imagine?　Is it helping?
Keep crafting and try using <cf>various Imagines!
Good day, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your help the other day.
I prepared this life-size wow doll. <cf>I was going to present it to Mr. Huovi. ......
[You know, Reichin, you're really good at crafting weapons, right? <cf>You're really good at crafting weapons, aren't you? ["]]
[Can you make one for me too? <cf>Then I'll get aggravated. ["]]
[--]You say so, sir.
I have been crafting <cf>weapons without a wink of sleep since then!
I am in awe of one bottle. <cf>I will craft a thousand or ten thousand!
But, Huovi-sama, <cf>["]I'll take the best one. It's not easy for you either.
What kind words for me ......! <cf>I've already had the pleasure of seeing you at my ...... I've already seen you at my ......!
<span size="Big">Hahhhhhh! &lt;/&gt;
[--]But we've discovered a problem. <cf>We've run out of materials for our weapons.
I can't stop crafting and I have to ask ...... <cf>adventurers to help me.
The material needed is "Pareidolite". <cf>You should be able to get it at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>"
With this one, I will craft a full-body swing for <cf>Huovi-sama!
If you are unable to collect the material, please contact <cf>me ...... me ......!
[--]Please accept my best regards. Dear Adventurer
I would like you to collect Pareidolite at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/><cf>
If you can't collect, I'm ...... <cf>I'm ......!　HAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. Thank you very much. ...... <cf>You have collected the "Pareidolite."
Now I can make a weapon to present to Mr. Huovi.
Once the crafting is finished, <cf>"plug installation" must proceed!
Weapons are provided with <cf>"sockets" for attaching "ability plugs"!
These are used to add abilities to a weapon. <cf>That's what "plug attachment" is all about.
You can ask a "Weapon Remodeler" to do this for you. <cf>Adventurers are welcome to try it!
Oh, yes, I'll give you this one.
This is an "Ability Plug Removal Ticket". <cf>It is used to remove unwanted abilities.
If the socket is filled, <cf>new abilities cannot be granted
In those cases, you remove the availability.
It's as if we were trying to <cf>clean out the bugs that cling to Mr. Huovi [--]!
[I have never been so glad to have learned <cf>about weapons as I was then!
Now, I must ask Mr. Huovi to pick up the <cf>weapon that I have poured my heart and soul into!
Hold me so tight I break my bones. ...... <cf>Breathtakingly kissing ......!
I have taken my weapons and <cf>messed them up so badly that there is not even a trace of my face left ......!
[--]Thank you very much. <cf>So long, Mr. Adventurer. Have a good day.
Good day, Mr. Adventurer.
How is your weapon plug installation? <cf>Try it more than once!
We'd be happy to <cf>get you a little closer to your ideal weapon.
Here's a poster for the Asterleeds Guard at <cf>recruiting members.
'You too can join us in protecting Asterleeds! <cf>　We are looking for security guards who will bring hope for tomorrow!"
<cf>rough text is painted over the word ......
<span size="Big">'Now that you've seen this, you're a squad member! &lt;/&gt;
<span size="Big">The reply is "["]Yes! The only reply is ["] or ["]oh! [Oh! &lt;/&gt;
If you have any complaints, come and see me! <cf>　We're looking for people with spirit, guts, and ability!
'We're at the Arena! <cf>　To Guard Platoon Leader Eubank!
[--]I can feel the intense heat coming on.
If you are interested in the Guard, visit <cf>Eubank near Arena!
Oh, what the hell! <cf>I'm Platoon Leader Eubank of the Guard.
Have you seen the ...... security posters? <cf>Oh yeah!　Pretty cool blurb, huh?
That means you're going to be a member of the squad! <cf>The reply is ["]yes! You can only reply "["]" or "["]" or "["]"! [Oh!
Hm......? <cf>Well ...... you're doing pretty good.
I'd say he's got the right stuff. <cf>My arms are tingling after a long time. ......
......!　Sorry, sorry. <cf>I'm getting old habits.
I used to be a gladiator in the Arena. <cf>When I see a strong guy, I get turned on.
I thought there were some fierce guys in the Guard. <cf>Listen to me. I'm pathetic, okay?
I've decided to have the Guard train <cf>to take down monsters.
And while you're at it, pick up some good material, too.
But the higher-ups made a fuss. <cf>[They said, "[Such] dangerous training is unacceptable.
I told him, "["]There's no reason why this stuff is dangerous! [I told him to go to <cf>, but he wouldn't listen.
No matter how hard the field tries, you can't move unless you get <cf>permission.
And that's where you come in. <cf>You're going to have to clean up my idea of training.
If someone actually did it, <cf>the top would have to shut up, right?
It might be boring for you. <cf>Just give me a little nudge.
The training is to collect materials for "Dragon Claw Valley, Additional Research". <cf>I'm counting on you!
Go to "Dragon Claw Valley, Additional Research" and take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_03_01_02001"/>
Collecting the "blackened fangs" they drop is <cf>my idea of training.
Well, I'm asking you to do it!
Hey, good job! <cf>Looks like the training menu went well.
That was easy, wasn't it?　Look at that. <cf>Look at that. The guy who can do it, can do it.
They all make a big deal about <cf>something they didn't even try.
I mean, that's the thing. <cf>You're an adventurer, you could have cleared it up, right?
So, as far as security force training goes, <cf>isn't it rather lukewarm?
That's right!　Okay, I've decided! <cf>Let's raise the difficulty level a couple more levels!
Double the number to be taken down. <cf>No portals allowed. Just run.
Let's have them get food locally. <cf>I'll fill the empty space in my bag with rocks, and voila!
All right, all right. <cf>It's going to be good training!
Thanks a lot!　Thanks to you, <cf>I can train my men hard!
Well, I'll see you around. <cf>Next time we have time, let's play!
I'm an adventurer!　Thanks. <cf>I see you're going to do the " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>" defeat!
We're on a pilgrimage to a holy place in Bapharia. <cf>But we can't get through the streets because of " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>".
I just couldn't move on from Larpal.
This is the place to be, okay? <cf>And the "Pillar of Divinity" is right there.
I can pray every day. <cf>It makes me feel a little bit better about it.
But you know what? You're right, after days like this, <cf>I'm getting bored.
Besides, I can't wait to go to Salamzart! <cf>My cousin lives over there.
Whenever I go on pilgrimage, I always promise to play. <cf>If you don't hurry up, we won't have time to play.
My mom and dad both say <cf>["]this is God's will ["]too."]
I can't take it anymore! <cf>Adventurers, please!　Defeat " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>"!
Have a safe trip. <cf>May God bless you in Bapharia.
I can't make the pilgrimage because of ' <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>'. <cf>They are stronger monsters than just Mooks.
My dad said the location is " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>".
It seems it's hard for normal people to take them down. <cf>I've been waiting for an adventurer to take them on.
Please!　I'll run out of time to play with Salamzart's cousin <cf>
Go ahead and beat it!
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>Thanks a lot!
This will get me to the Montegnor Valley. <cf>Salamzart is much further, though.
Everyone was happy that the pilgrimage could continue.
Ah, yes. The priest thanked me too. <cf>Yes, I did. I gave it to him.
Well, I'm off, my dad and the guys are calling me. <cf>Thanks again!
God of Bapharia, we thank you. <cf>Please give grace to the adventurers as well.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>Thanks for asking for my advice.
I'm Einar, an actor. I'm still a newcomer. <cf>I just came here from Litze the other day.
I was thinking about taking over the family business, but ...... <cf>I just couldn't give up on my dream of being an actor.
Fortunately, Asterleeds has a thriving arts scene. <cf>The chairperson liked me too.
So, I'm about to go on stage for the first time <cf>and I have to dance.
I don't know much about urban music. <cf>The rhythm and tempo are unique.
On top of that, we need choreography. <cf>My head is already spinning.
So I wanted someone to set an example. <cf>And I don't have any friends I can ask yet.
Sorry for the weird request, but <cf>I need to see you 'dance' in front of me.
I want to study dance. <cf>Could you show me how to 'dance' in front of me?
<span size="Big">Wonderful! &lt;/&gt;
I see. ...... I see! <cf>I feel like I just woke up.
I was only concerned about rhythm, steps, and form. <cf>But it's not like that. It's not like that.
I enjoyed your dance! <cf>Just watching you made my heart skip a beat.
That's more important than getting in shape. <cf>Dance happily and entertain those who are watching.
I could see it clearly when I saw you dance. <cf>And of course you had a beautiful smile.
That was a really good dance. <cf>Why don't we all dance together?
Maybe a street corner, or a stage. <cf>Maybe even dancing on rooftops would be fun.
Thank you very much! <cf>You've paved the way for me.
I will make my own dance too. <cf>I am sure it will be a good stage!
Adventurer!　I want to be reborn!
<span size="Big">Please help us! &lt;/&gt;
Wow!　I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ...... <cf>I suddenly started to speak louder. ......
I'm very reclusive and ....... <cf>I want to be reborn as a new me through esthetics.
Did you know?　Esthetic salon. <cf>You can change your hair and facial features at will.
Not only that, but you can also adapt your body shape and voice to <cf>your liking.
If I Accept the esthetic treatment, I will be able to restart my <cf>life with a new feeling. ......
Um, so, ....... <cf>I have something I'd like you adventurers to fetch for me.
Five "Land Fox Silverheads" and five <cf>"Uribo's Double Fangs" ......
Huh?　You mean to go to an esthetic salon <cf>you need something like that?
No, um, no. ....... <cf>This is material for an outfit I want to wear after the esthetic ......
If you want to use an esthetic salon, <cf>You can get a ticket for that.
As a thank you for this request, <cf>I will give you a ticket to the esthetic clinic, ......
Materials should be delivered to the designer, Thierry, at <cf>
Well, then ...... <span size="Big">I'm off to the beauty salon! &lt;/&gt;
<span size="Big">Best regards! &lt;/&gt;
Wow!　 <cf>I'm suddenly shouting loudly again: ......
Costume materials are available at ......
Five "Land Fox Silver Hair" and five <cf>"Double Fangs of Uribo".
They should be taken from <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>of <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>and ......, respectively!
When you collect them, please deliver them to the designer, Thierry, at <cf>
<span size="Big">Please, please, please! &lt;/&gt;
Yes, welcome. <cf>Do you need a costume?　Please take a look.
Oh, hey. You have a delivery for me? <cf>Oh, you must be Noah. I've heard so much about you.
I'm getting a letter and a detailed order form from <cf>asking me to get you an outfit that will make you feel confident in yourself.
The Silver Hair of the Land Fox" and "Double Fangs of Uribo". <cf>Yeah. The materials are exactly as they were on the order form.
All right, I'll take care of it! <cf>I'll be right back to tailor it for you.
Here you go. <cf>I've made you the best outfit!
What do you think?　Stylish men's fashion! <cf>I think I drew some really cool lines!
This will catch any woman's eye! <cf>I'm sure she'll look back when she sees you on the street.
Hmmm, it's still me!　That's me! <cf>Maybe it's time for me to seriously consider going independent.
What?　What's wrong with men?
Is ...... Noah a woman? <cf>No, no, no, that can't be right.
The order form definitely asks for a man's outfit. <cf>There's no way they could have made a mistake.
I have the chest and waist in men's sizes as well. ...... <cf>I wonder if that's ok?　I'm a little nervous.
Anyway, deliver it to Noah. <cf>Are you Accepting the beauty treatments?　If so, she should be done by now.
If I'm wrong, I'll make it right. <cf>Please do!
It's almost time for Noah to finish his beauty treatment. <cf>You can deliver the costume to Noah.
If the size is wrong, I'll make it right!
Oh, thank you, adventurer. <cf>You got me my outfit.
Oh, what's wrong? <cf>Oh, man, it's Noah who asked you to do this!
Hmph, are you surprised? <cf>This is the reborn, new me!
It looks like they even changed genders? <cf>Hmmm... ...... Well, what do you think?
If you are interested, adventurers are welcome to experience it!
Ah, yes. Before I forget, here you go. <cf>Here's your ticket to the esthetic salon.
By the way, if you want to try it out, you can do the esthetic experience without a <cf>ticket!
New hairstyles and makeup are also available <cf>for a freer, more unique look!
<span size="Big">Yes!　Just like I am now! &lt;/&gt;
What?　Why did you change so much?
Whenever you look in the mirror, your ideal figure is there. ...... <cf>Wouldn't that be the happiest thing ever!
Hmph, I am too beautiful ....... <cf>We'll be together from now on. ......
Now I'm going to go change into my new outfit and <cf>look at every inch of myself in the mirror!
May you also gain <cf>beauty and confidence through esthetics!
Adventurer, in a good place! <cf>Please help me!
This is a coloring store. <cf>It's a store where you can change the color of your costume.
Just by changing the color of a costume, <cf>the impression can be completely changed!
You can dye it pretty!　You can dye it pretty or cool! <cf>You can enjoy fashion freely as you like!
At the forefront of fashion in town! <cf>Coloring store, newly opened!
It was supposed to be ......
I can't believe I haven't received the all-important color samples! <cf>It's almost time to open the store!
So we need you to collect <cf>dye material for sample preparation!
Three "Saphlea Flowers" and one "[blue bell stone (seirinseki)". <cf>Both can be found at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
I'll take care of that for now! <cf>I'll get the store ready to open in the meantime.
It's up to the adventurers to open the store! <cf>We look forward to working with you!
For making dye samples, we need <cf>3 "Safrea flowers" and 1 "[blue bell stone]".
Both can be found at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
It's up to the adventurers to open the store!
I see that you have collected the materials! <cf>Thank you!
Yeah, "Safrea flower" and "[blue bell stone]". <cf>That should take care of the red and blue samples.
I also need the green color. <cf>I now know why I can't reach this one!
The wagon was attacked by a monster at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" and <cf>luggage was taken by <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>
Excuse me, adventurer. <cf>Could you please return the "Green Dye Sample"?
It would be faster to do so at <cf>than to collect new materials.
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>If you punish the "Mere Old Man", he will leave it behind. <cf>Feel free to punish him!
Considering where the wagons were attacked: ......
There should be a <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>that took the luggage to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>and retrieve <cf>"Green Dye Sample" by defeating the "Green Dye Sample"!
Thank you very much! <cf>The "Green Dye Samples" are now ready!
If we can collect the dyes so deftly, <cf>we might be able to open a store for adventurers!
Since we're here, let me explain about coloring <cf>
The first thing you need is "coloring dye". <cf>These are separated by color.
The colors and number of colors required will vary depending on the costume. <cf>Make sure to check and note them down!
If you have a favorite color, we recommend that you collect <cf>many of them!
Also, please note that some costumes cannot be dyed <cf>
Don't forget to check there as well!
The "Dye Retardant" can be used to <cf>restore the color of the costume to its initial state!
If you make a mistake in dyeing, or if you want to restore the <cf>color, use it!
Conversely, the more you can undo <cf>it, the more you can dye it!
Colorful coordination by the adventurers! <cf>I'm looking forward to it too!
Well then, I'm ready to go. ......
Sorry to keep you waiting!　The cutting edge of fashion in town! <cf>The livery store is now open!
<span size="Big">Welcome! &lt;/&gt;
Hah, Mr. Huovi. ...... <cf>I wish to be one with you. ......
I adore you. I want to be the marrow of your bones ....... <cf>No, I want to be your marrow!
Hahhhhhhhhhh! <cf>I can't help myself!
Good day, adventurer. <cf>I know you well.
You are a friend of Mr. Huovi, aren't you?
My name is Rainey. <cf>I'm Rainey, and I work in weapons research at the Imagine Institute.
I am a colleague of Mr. Huovi's and ...... <cf>I have a deep and abiding admiration for him.
It's already a geyser of love that erupts <cf>like a geyser that is about to burst your heart ......!
Mr. Huovi, if you stare at me that much <cf>I'm ...... I'm ......!
[--]I'm afraid I'm going to have to <cf>do something about this!
So, to appease my heart, I decided to give <cf>a gift to Mr. Huovi.
I will present a life-size doll of myself to <cf>Huovi to do with as she pleases.
Yes, as you like ...... as you like! <cf>You messed me up, Mr. Huovi!
Dear [--]Adventurer, I have a favor to ask of you. <cf>Could you please collect the materials for the gift?
What is missing is "Giant Dragon Dual Tailbone". <cf>It is a material that can only be obtained in a limited number of places.
You should be able to get <cf>by stepping on " <value type="locationName" id="dng009"/>"
You can't find <cf>by looking for and collecting it like any other material, so please be careful!
If you can't get your hands on "The Giant Dragon's Twin Tailbone," <cf>www. ...... www!
[Thank you very much for your cooperation. <cf>I am continuing to work on my dolls.
You should be able to get <cf>"The Giant Dragon's Twin Tailbone" by stepping on " <value type="locationName" id="dng009"/>"!
I am continuing to work on the dolls, so please bring them here: <cf>
Thank you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I have indeed received the "Dual Tailbone of the Giant Dragon."
You are very strong. <cf>I admire your skill.
You can get special materials only at <cf>when you go through the "Dragon Claw Valley" and other dungeons.
It should be used often for crafting weapons.
You may want to be aware of the <cf>set of weapon crafting and dungeon trudging
Now, the material for my life-size adult form is ready. <cf>I'll have to remember to write them down.
Oh, is this it? <cf>It's a "wish list."
You can use the <cf>wish list to collect materials for weapons and Imagine!
You can register your recipes here: <cf>to see how many materials you have gathered.
It must be painstaking to count the materials over and over again <cf>as you go on your adventure, right?
Wish List makes it easy to see at a glance
Register your powerful weapon or Imagine and make <cf>your goal for your adventure!
Of course, don't worry, your wish list will be automatically updated at <cf>
What?　The contents of my wish list?
Of course, it's all about Mr. Huovi! <cf>I want nothing else but her!
At first glance, the list is filled with names of Master Huovi. <cf>Ah ...... bliss is what I'm talking about!
A very useful wish list. <cf>In Huovi's words, the Wiss~☆List.
We hope you will take advantage of the wonderful Huovish list at <cf>Adventurers!
One day the list will be filled. ...... <cf>Mr. Huovi, I ...... I ......
[--]Just imagining it made me run <cf>through a rage!
Dear Adventurer. <cf>I hope you and Mr. Huovi will continue to be friends.
I'll be watching from the shadows. <cf>Hmph. ...... hmph. ......
Good day, adventurers. <cf>Are you making use of your wish list?
If you have any concerns, please feel free to let me know at <cf>
He is a friend of Mr. Huovi's. I will do my best to help him! <cf>I will do my best to help you!
I'm in trouble ...... That stone can't be thrown away ......
But it's ...... dangerous to go get it.
I'm ...... glad you're taking on ...... and ...... helping me out. <cf>I don't think I can handle ...... on my own.
I'm a stud ....... I'm on a journey to collect stones. <cf> You could call me a [collector (しゅうしゅうか)]......
I travel around and pick up ...... <cf>valuable stones.
But on the way to Minsterhorn, I was attacked by ...... <cf>monsters.
I threw ...... a 'stone of value' at him and ...... <cf>he ran away ...... while the other guy was scared!
That was ...... a good stone. <cf>One of ...... best bargains on a long journey.
I'd like to go back and pick it up again, but ...... <cf>there's no end to it ...... if I get attacked again.
Sorry ...... but instead of ...... <cf>picking up a "valuable stone" please!
The location is ...... a little far ....... <cf>Mount Imagine makes it ...... easy.
It's a mounted Imagine...... you know what I'm talking about? <cf>It's a vehicle-shaped Imagine: ......
If you use it, you can get around ...... much faster than on foot. <cf>You can take it out anytime and it's ...... convenient. ......
Adventurers will surely find ...... useful. <cf>It makes moving around so smooth and ...... enjoyable.
But I prefer the ...... stone.
The charm of that stone ...... was irreplaceable. <cf>Maybe ...... monsters will like it too!
Please ...... before someone notices and takes it away.
If you look at the map, ...... <cf>you'll see the approximate location ......
This is no ordinary stone. ...... <cf>I'm asking ...... for a 'stone of value.'
How's ...... going? <cf>Did you find ...... the "Worthy Stone"?
It will be a little ...... far away from ....... <cf>I recommend ...... using Mount Imagine. ......
I was so desperate that I don't remember ...... detailed location, but it's <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" ...... somewhere.
Nice to meet you. ......
This is ...... the stone I threw. <cf>It's a 'stone of value.' ...... Thank you.
This stone is neither a ...... rare ore nor a gemstone. <cf>It will not be worth ...... money when sold.
But this stone has ...... <cf>value that can't be replaced ...... for money.
This size ...... and the rugged roughness of the surface ....... <cf>The colors and placement are ...... truly exquisite!
And ...... you know what I mean? <cf>This vertical crack ...... is this one.
It would be like a wound of ...... honor that has entered the body of a past battle.
Don't you understand ......?　...... I see. <cf>I'm sorry, but ...... that's a normal reaction. ......
It's okay. ...... I'm used to it. <cf>This is also the [collector's] ...... fate.
Speaking of which, have you tried using ...... Mount Imagine at ...... <cf>?
That's something you can ride ...... not only in the field, but ...... <cf>in the city.
If you dash, you can get ...... quite a bit of speed out of ......
It does consume Stamina, though, ....... <cf>It should also ...... recover over time. ......
When you go far away from home, it's ...... much faster than walking ......
I walk ...... not to miss ...... stones, but <cf>mounts would be useful for ...... adventurers... ...
I hear there are many different kinds of ....... <cf>Mount Imagine's [collectors] might be interesting too ......
With a prominent mount, ...... <cf>I bet you'll be ...... popular!
Phew ...... not like ...... stone collectors.
It's okay ...... for me, as long as I have the stones ....... <cf>You go ...... enjoy your mounts and adventures .......
Thanks for the stone ....... <cf>If you need anything else, please contact me at ...... then.
Where is your next destination ......? <cf>If it's far away, you can use ...... mount
<cf>It would be ...... better for ...... mounts to use it and do it ...... well!
We are currently preparing to open. <cf>Please wait a little longer.
Actually, I have a feeling we're in a bit of trouble: ......
We may ask the pioneering bureau to make a request later. <cf>Your confirmation would be appreciated.
Welcome, welcome! <cf>This is a memory stand.
You're out of luck, customer! <cf>The store isn't open yet.
Patti. Watch your language? <cf>I told you you're a fine waitress too.
Oh, uh, ......
O, it's not open yet, you know?
Excuse me, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>This girl is new. She's still practicing her customer service skills.
Let me explain about our services.
Memory Stands offers drinks that temporarily boost your ability to <cf>
The "Liquid Memory" is used for this. <cf>It's the liquid of Bapharia's heritage.
This has the property of storing customer experiences and memories and <cf>gradually activating them
And when you drink the activated liquid memory, you Accept <cf>various benefits!
For example, the efficiency of collecting materials is increased, <cf>crafting weapons is a little cheaper, and so on.
All of them are useful for your adventures!
However, the bottle that holds the liquid memory seems to have been damaged during <cf>delivery ......
We are unable to open the store as it is, which is why we have asked <cf>Adventurers to help us!
You can get materials for the <cf>bin by collecting at <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>
Could you please deliver one each of "Frozen Star Grass" and "Piled Mine" to <cf>
Once you have a bottle, you can open a store. <cf>We will also give one bottle to our adventurers.
We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you in advance for your patience at <cf>
Be careful, adventurer!
Oh, no, no, no. ....... <cf>Well, please be careful!
...... Patty is training to serve customers until the ingredients arrive. <cf>The opening is just around the corner. We're running out of time.
Oh, sister?　What's wrong? <cf>What's wrong with your eyes? ......?
Can you please deliver one each of "Frozen Star Grass" and "Piled Mine" to <cf>
You can get it at " <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>". <cf>You don't have to go that deep to find it.
Dear Adventurer! <cf>I see that you brought the materials for the bottles!
Thank you very much! <cf>Now you can open the memory stand!
Oh!　You're doing it!
<span size="Big">Pa-tee? &lt;/&gt;
...... will do, won't you?
Please excuse ....... Dear Adventurer. <cf>Once again, thank you.
Here is the bottle of liquid memory for your reward. <cf>Please accept it.
Since we're here, let me explain how to use <cf>properly.
Liquid memory automatically accumulates <cf>experience and memories according to the actions of the adventurer!
And when enough is accumulated, it becomes 'activated'. <cf>You can tell right away because it changes color.
When using the memory stand, please bring <cf>activated liquid memory
We purify it with our own technology and offer it as a <cf>delicious drink.
For example, if you use the liquid memory I just gave you, you can get the effect of <cf>"Increases the amount of material collected"!
The condition for activation is "defeating monsters". <cf>If you have adventures, I think you will be activated naturally!
By utilizing this liquid memory <cf>you can get more material for the same number of times collected!
It can also reduce the number of collections required. <cf>That could free up time for other things.
We hope we can help you broaden your adventures!
This is not the only type of liquid memory. <cf>Please find others and make use of them!
Okay, Patty. <cf>Get ready for the opening, okay?
I'm on it!
...... Leave it to me?
Huh. ....... I hope it's ok.
The liquid memory you just mentioned <cf>has already been activated.
If you like, you can use it right after this!
Please continue to utilize the memory stand to make your <cf>adventures more efficient!
Picked up a bottle of liquid memory.
Everything is going well, except for the customer service! <cf>I'm so talented!
Let's see, where do I press? <cf>...... Well, I don't know, I'll just have to use my instincts!
After all, you are so talented! <cf>It's a piece of cake to operate a machine!
Adventurer, will you take care of it? <cf>Yay!　Thanks!
Oh, no, thank you very much. ......? <cf>Nice to meet you ......?
...... I knew I shouldn't have. <cf>I'm still practicing my customer service lingo.
It's going to take a while, so I'll just talk normally.
Actually, I was purifying a drink, but I don't know how to use the <cf>equipment.
I was operating on a hunch and it broke. <cf>I didn't do anything to it.
So, I need some parts to fix it.
Daijobu. I've done my research on what's out there.
Let's see, the "Engram Separator" from Bapharia Heritage. <cf>They use it to clean liquid memory.
But hey, ....... <cf>I have no idea where to get it!
They don't seem to sell them in the stores. <cf>Don't you know, adventurers?
It's Bapharia's heritage, so maybe the ...... ruins? <cf>But there are so many ruins.
Do you know any Bapharia priests or <cf>priestesses?
Anyway, I want "Engram Separator" more than my allowance, <cf>not angry seniors, than I want "Engram Separator" now!
Please, please, please!　Please! <cf>Please go find the "Engram Separator"!
...... Huh? <cf>I think I just used the proper honorific?
I don't care what the means are! <cf>I'll give you a new bottle of liquid memory as a thank you!
I also received one as a commemorative gift for the opening. <cf>It's the kind you can use in the store.
Please!　This way! <cf>If the lady at the store finds out, I'll have to lecture you again!
I just need one "Engram Separator"! <cf>Please help me!
What do you think? <cf>Did you find the Engram Separator?
I'm sure a Bapharia priest or something would know <cf>where to find it: ......
They haven't found out yet that I broke the equipment in your store. <cf>But please do so as soon as possible!
Welcome to Temple Bapharia. <cf>God will always watch over us!
Is there something you want to ask me? <cf>If it's all right with me, I'll be happy to help.
Is ...... where the "Engram Separator" can be found? <cf>Indeed, the Order is the custodian of Bapharia's heritage.
Items found or taken from the site are also recorded at <cf>
Let's look into the "Engram Separator". <cf>Please wait a moment.
Thank you for your patience at ....... <cf>I've been trying to find out where the "Engram Separator" was found.
But ....... I'm afraid this will be difficult even for <cf>adventurers to get hold of!
The Engram Separator is to be found at <cf>the innermost part of the Pillar of Divinity!
Have you ever heard of the "Pillar of Divinity"? <cf>It is the remains of a magnificent tower located north of Divine Haven Hill.
This is the most important holy place in the Bapharia religion. <cf>No one is allowed to enter without special permission.
What?　You have a permit and ......?
...... This is definitely a permit to enter the mihashira ....... <cf>I see. ...... You are Einrain-sama's ......
No, I beg your pardon. <cf>If you have permission, no problem.
You may enter the "Pillar of Divinity. <cf>Please also bring your "Engram Separator" with you.
Many of Bapharia's heritage rests in the Order's sacred sites and ruins <cf>
It is the will of God in Bapharia that they be used by men to enrich the earth <cf>
Of course, you're not allowed to vandalize <cf>the ruins any more than necessary!
But this time I am asking for my purpose. <cf>I have no problem taking out one of your legacies.
It is a fact that numerous legacies have been left behind in the mihashira. <cf>It is a sign of faith in God to bring them back home and utilize them.
...... And if you are the one Mr. Einrain mentioned, <cf>you can't go wrong in a million ways!
Sorry, we're talking about this one.
Please go to " <value type="locationName" id="dng005"/>". <cf>Permission is granted to take out the "Engram Separator".
Please take care. <cf>May the God of Bapharia guide you.
Did you find the "Engram Separator" you were looking for at <cf>?
You may want to do " <value type="locationName" id="dng005"/>". <cf>You should be able to get it at the very back.
You know someone who needs it, don't you? <cf>Please deliver them to them.
Oh, the "Engram Separator"! <cf>You really brought it!
Thanks! <cf>Now I won't have to get angry!
Yes, well, here! <cf>A bottle of liquid memory as a thank you.
Let's see, the description says ...... <cf>"Increases the speed of material collection"!
Will this work for me too? <cf>When I pick up coins, can I pick them up with a "shubha"?　when I pick up coins?
The activation will be promoted by "accomplishing missions." <cf>Please challenge and clear them as much as you can!
Oh, and. Important story.
...... I broke a piece of equipment in the store and <cf>I don't tell anyone I have this way of talking!
If only your sister knew. ......
[What's going to happen?
Hiiiiiiii!　Sis, <span size="Big">I'm out! &lt;/&gt;
......We look forward to <cf>using your services in the future!
Patti has a <span size="Big">tease waiting for you&lt;/&gt;
Oh, no!
Liquid memory bottles can be found all over the <cf>place!
There seem to be a lot of people <cf>who use it as a reward for requests to adventurers.
You might want to check <cf>Mamma's for pioneer bureau requests or something like that!
...... you, what can I do for you?
Maybe they've heard something, though... ...... <cf>It's probably too early to tell.
Let's talk again when the time comes. ......
Well, you. <cf>Can you spare the money ......?
The more money you spend, the less you have. ...... <cf>It's a very common problem for the living, isn't it? Hey ......?
But they do what I ask. <cf>Maybe that trouble will get a little better: ......
Well, ...... the fun can wait. <cf>First, let's hear what I have to say: ......
I think it's around ...... <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" east of Bahamar Highland these days.
The Horngoat is on the rampage: ....... <cf>But not just any horngoat: ......
His name is " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>" ....... <cf>He's a psycho who reacts to the engrams of the dead and goes berserk.
Thanks to you, the dead who buried their bones can no longer sleep in peace <cf>......
If you take that one down <cf>I'll give you a good one ......
<cf>that are not legitimately distributed, but are off the books. ......
I don't think it's a bad story. ......
I'm asking you to take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>" ......
What's wrong...... forgetting......? <cf>Good, good...... forgetting is also a privilege of the living......
East of Bahamar Highland, " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" ....... <cf>We're taking down a Horngoat named " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>".
I'm counting on you. ......
You're back or ...... I don't have to ask. <cf>You, you did it. ......
The footsteps of " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>" have stopped ....... <cf>Those strange, grating footsteps. ......
Now we can all get a good night's sleep. ......
Very well, I'll give you this bottle: ......
As you can see, it's a bottle of liquid memory. <cf>But don't show it to too many people. ......
If the city finds out there is such a thing, the city will be in chaos. ...... <cf>You won't get a free pass either. ......
That bin is one that reduces the consumption of gold. ...... <cf>Not in the sense of saving money, nah.
'When you use the facilities for adventurers <cf>the price of everything is reduced'. ......
What, I'm just tinkering a bit with my awareness of my surroundings <cf>...... no harm done.
No one will notice. ...... <cf>Unless you're showing off.
I don't know what would happen <cf>if someone in their greed realized ...... what was going on. ......
...... Why do you care why I have this <cf>thing?
I have been living in the underworld ...... for a long time. <cf>I dealt with those who pulled the strings of the world from the shadows. ......
I thought I was taking advantage of their greed, but <cf>I was also entangled in ...... lust!
The one who found himself being preyed upon was this one: ....... <cf>People are really stupid. ......
......I guess I talked a little too much. <cf>Take good care of that bottle. ......
How you handle both light and dark is up to you. ...... <cf>You've got to stand up to it well. ......
I'm sorry, Louise, ....... <cf>I didn't realize what I did was taking a back seat to the monsters. ......
I'm just glad you made it back alive. <cf>Take good care of yourself. Don't push yourself too hard.
Uh-oh!　Luise-san! <cf>When I recover, I will collect it next time!
Yeah, I'll be there. Good luck. <cf>I'm counting on you.
However, I'm in trouble. <cf>Is there anyone else we can ask?
Oh? <cf>Are you going to Accept my request?
Hey!　You too, ...... for Louise's request! <cf>This request is very challenging. Are you alright?
But, I think I know what I'm doing. ...... <cf>Maybe, just maybe........
If that's what Louise says, you can go to ....... <cf>It's not my place to interfere. You, keep up the good work.
I'm Louise, a liquid memory researcher. <cf>I'm working with the Bureau of Reclamation to develop a bottle.
Various adventurers are standing up at <cf>to help me gather materials for that purpose.
The monsters are too strong. <cf>Everyone fails.
I'm ashamed to say I'm one of the ones who screwed up. <cf>I was hoping to show Mr. Louise a good time.
If you complete the request, <cf>will give you a bottle of liquid memory in development.
You need two kinds of materials
First of all, I want you to collect <cf>"Full Moon Stones" which can be found at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>
You can't tell a "full moon stone" from an ordinary stone <cf>during the day, so you have to collect it at night.
But it seems that there are some very powerful monsters <cf>near the place where you can collect them.
If you find it too tough, turn back immediately. <cf>If you fall down, don't!
I think it's a good idea to use <cf>for a liquid memory that can be quickly collected.
I think it will be a little safer <cf>because it will take less time to collect the samples.
Oh, I see you already have one. <cf>This is the time to use your liquid memory!
Deliver the "Full Moon Stone" to me at <cf>and I'll tell you about the next material.
Well then, good-bye. <cf>Take care and go~♪
How's your material collection going?　 <cf>Go collect the "Full Moon Stone".
You can find it in the east of Bahamar Highland. <cf>You can find it at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>
You can only collect them at night, don't you remember?
There are strong monsters out there, so don't overdo it. <cf>If you get in danger, run away, okay?
Did you bring the "Full Moon Stone"?
Yay! Wow, wow, wow! <cf>You're so strong!
Thanks to you, we now have enough Full Moon Stones. <cf>Thank you so much!
Well, here's another one for you. <cf>Nikkoumame" which can be found at " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>".
Contrary to what you said earlier, <cf>this one is only found during the daytime.
Collect them while the sun is shining. <cf>You can't collect them at night.
Don't let your guard down just because you've been there once. <cf>Be prepared!
No need to rush. <cf>It's important to take it easy and rest~.
Go to <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>and collect <cf>"Nikkoumame"!
You can only find these during the daytime. <cf>You have to collect it while the sun is shining.
Now you have all the materials, so hang in there! <cf>I'll give you something good when I'm done.
Wow, it really is "Nikkoumame"! <cf>You must have collected them all!
Wow!　Thank you very much... <cf>You've been a big help...
Well then, I'll give you <cf>the bottle of liquid memory I promised.
This bottle makes it <cf>easier to get materials when you kill a monster than usual.
If you want to collect materials from monsters, <cf>should be very useful.
When you "do a collection", <cf>liquid memory will be activated.
I want you to use it when you fight a lot of monsters <cf>to collect materials.
What do you think?　Isn't it a very useful effect? <cf>Louise's newest creation...
Oh, thank goodness! Thanks to you, <cf>I can start my next research project!
You are really great. <cf>I'd love to work with you again!
そのときはぁ、よろしくねぇ♪ <cf>ルイーゼさんでしたぁ～♪　バイバ～イ♪
Liquid memory jars are often used as a reward for <cf>requests.
Check out the request from the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>A wonderful reward may be waiting for you...
I'm going to a good center, though!　I'm going well, but... <cf>I'm almost there.
I wonder if there is someone somewhere <cf>who could be a good role model.
Oh!　Are you alone?
Welcome, welcome. <cf>I'm glad you've come a long way.
I'm Mea. This is Mei. <cf>I'm helping to organize the team. Nice to meet you!
If you came to us, you must be interested in the team, right?
I wonder what a team is in the first place?　Maire.
You must have some hobbies or goals, right? <cf>You must have some hobbies or goals, like taking a leisurely stroll or exploring some ruins.
A team is a group of like-minded people who come together for a common goal. <cf>
You form a party each time you go to a <cf>dungeon, and you work together, right?
Teams are another big bundle.
Connected by the same goals and desires <cf>Usually, they are free to do their own activities.
We share information and <cf>praise each other's accomplishments.
Of course, you can also organize a <cf>party with other members of your team!
We're going to go on an adventure, aren't we? <cf>I want to have fun with people who share my interests.
Mea and Mei~! <cf>Here's a new plan!　I'm confident this time!
This time, we will all step on the "Dragon Claw Valley" together!
Oh, you're here. <cf>These are the new team I told you about at your request.
[I'm going to complete every dungeon in the world! ["]"] <cf>with a very cheerful goal in mind.
We stumbled early on in Dragon Claw Valley, and <cf>we're having trouble with it, too.
If we keep this up, we'll be grandmothers by the time we get to <cf>
So here it is. Why don't you set an example for the rest of us?
Clean up the " <value type="locationName" id="dng009"/>". <cf>I'll let the newbies see how it's done.
It's a good idea to go with a group of like-minded people! <cf>It's not wise to go alone, is it?
It's just a trial run before we put a team together.
Nice to meet you, seniors! <cf>We will study together!
I'm counting on you. <cf>Well, I'll take care of it.
It's a good time to go with a group of like-minded people! <cf>It's just a trial run before we put a team together.
We have to go soon, or we'll lose the day.
Oh, you're back!
You came slowly, didn't you? <cf>Are you hurt?
It looks like we did well. <cf>Our eyes were not mistaken!
Thank you for earlier! <cf>I was so moved to see the courage of my seniors!
Now I'm not afraid of "Dragon Claw Valley" <cf>Everyone is excited!
The next one, "Valley of Machines," is also <cf>We will definitely trudge through it together!
Thank you very much. <cf>These kids look so happy!
When you broke through the Dragon Claw Valley, the whole <cf>team was cheering for you!
The best thing about a team is that we can share goals like that and <cf>get everyone excited!
You want to form a team!　If you want to join us! <cf>If you want to join us, let us know!
We are looking forward to seeing you. We are looking forward to seeing you.
You guys should get into it! <cf>Don't embarrass the adventurers!
Hei!　Maire and Mei, sisters! <cf>Thank you for your kind attention!
Ah!
I will follow the example of your adventurers! <cf>Nari, take a cue from your sisters!
We will face our own people and <cf>try to build up our own stakes!
Please refrain from doing so!　 <span size="Big">Thanks again! &lt;/&gt;
Oh, ....... <cf>That's not what I'm talking about. ......
That's a lot of trouble. ......
Hmmm, what was it? <cf>I need to do something, but I can't remember: ......
But I didn't note anything that looks like it. ......
Is that funny?
Welcome to the Coloring Shop! <cf>Welcome to the livery store!"
'Hot New Service! <cf>We're going to start adjusting brightness and saturation!"
'Meat and eggs on special!　Buy them and go home!
...... Oh!　This was a different note!
Um, thank you <cf>for Accepting my request. Adventurer.
In fact, the coloring store will now offer a new service <cf>that allows you to "adjust brightness and saturation"!
So, the manager told me to collect the necessary "[colorant]" materials <cf>......
I lost my note about it and <cf>totally forgot about it!
I've always had a hard time remembering things. ...... <cf>I write down everything I do for a living.
Sometimes I even read different things.
Anyway, I turned over my previous notes and found the ingredients for <cf>"[colorant]".
Please go to <cf>and collect the "tone flowers" that are blooming at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>".
Me, I'm stuck working on something else. ....... <cf>It's because I lost my notes. Sorry!
I'll make sure to leave a note at <cf>of what I asked the adventurers to do.
I've made a note of the rewards! <cf>I won't lose this!
I'm stuck working on something else, so I'll be at ....... <cf>Sorry, thanks in advance!
I see that you collected the "Tone Flower"! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
With this, you can make a "colorant. <cf>I will give one to the adventurers as a gift.
Let's see, for notes on what you can do with "[colorant]": ......
'The arms dealer received a package by mistake <cf>'
Hah wow!　I forgot to call you! <cf>Senpai, senpaiーッ!
Oh, here you go, adventurer: ......
Once again, thank you very much for collecting the materials for "[colorant]" <cf>
I'll explain the new service this time. <cf>Here are the notes!
"The toner will allow you to adjust the brightness and saturation of your store's new service, <cf>!"
This further expands the range of costume coloring <cf>."
Adjusting the brightness changes the brightness of the color. <cf>Raise it to make the color whiter, and lower it to make it darker.
Adjust the saturation to change the vividness of the colors. <cf>Raise it to make the colors more vivid, and lower it to make them duller.
The colorant can be used on its own, but we recommend combining it with <cf>dyes!"
By adjusting brightness and saturation, <cf>you can create the color you want more than ever before."
We hope you'll give it a try!"
Marche, you are amazing! <cf>Perfect explanation!
If you can do that much, even while looking at your notes, you're doing great!
Yay! <cf>Thank you, seniors!
Thank you again, Adventurer, for your cooperation <cf>!
I hope you and Marche-chan will keep in touch with us at <cf>
Well then, I'm ready to go. ......
Sorry to keep you waiting!　The cutting edge of fashion in town! <cf>It's a new service at the livery store!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Let's see... ...... Memo, memo for this kind of thing
How's that for brightness and saturation?"
"By all means, dress to your liking and have fun!"
Oh!　Hey there, adventurer on the road. <cf>How about a little adventure advice?
I call myself an adventure advisor. <cf>I'm a guy who gives out advice on a daily basis.
I'm trying <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>・Training" right now!
<cf>from <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>in " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" with the training method that I got the tip from.
I'm going to infuse some "Highland Fox Ingrown Claws" and drink it while I work out my <cf>agility.
It's also supposed to help regulate your stomach.
I'm about to lose that "Plateau Fox Ingrown Nail" and thought I'd go get it <cf>on my own ......
I'm not very good at it! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>I am no match for the
I tried "weapon tuning" for a shot in the arm, but the results were not <cf>good. No luck it seems!
Tuning is one way to enhance a weapon.
Do you know how to "plug in" a weapon? <cf>It's a way to enhance a weapon by adding abilities to it.
Tuning can change the accuracy of <cf>its availability!
The more accurate the same ability is, the stronger it is! <cf>So that's what you're going for with the tuning.
Check the number of sockets on the weapon when crafting! <cf>Plug installation will give you abilities there!
And then tune it up to enhance its abilities! <cf>Think of it this way.
I have a "tuning ticket" right here. <cf>How about this as a reward?
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" and collect the <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>to <cf>"Ingrown Nails of the Plateau Fox"
When I give you the ticket, I'll also advise you <cf>in detail about tuning in!
I'll give you a "Tuning Ticket" as a reward. <cf>Thank you very much!
Oh, you're back! <cf>And I did receive the Plateau Fox's Curly Nails.
Now you can resume your training. <cf>...... Well, the effect is bemusing. Yup.
Then I'll exchange it for a 'tuning ticket'. <cf>You should definitely try tuning.
The first step is to check your weapon. <cf>Plug installation will give you abilities.
Certain parameters would be increased or <cf>class skills enhanced
And what is remarkable is its accuracy!
Tuning can improve the accuracy of <cf>availability!
You can even have the highest precision abilities available. <cf>You can change your weapon to your liking.
However, the tuning results are random.
It depends on your luck and perseverance to get the precision you want.
It can be lower than the effectiveness of your current abilities. <cf>You need to be careful there.
And, you know, you can <cf>"keep" and protect the abilities that don't need to change their accuracy.
It's safe to say that good availability is a keeper!
Just like any adventure, you have to keep trying without being discouraged. <cf>If you do that, you will get closer to your ideal weapon!
Use the plugs and tuning and get <cf>the right weapon for you!
That's all the advice I have for you today! <cf>Don't neglect your training and your tuning!
Have you tried tuning it? <cf>It's all about perseverance. Don't give up.
Damn, with papers like this it's just a pipe dream!
The key to solving the mystery of "Void's Island": ....... <cf>The only way to get the real thing somehow is to get the real thing. ......
I am Frederik, an employee of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I'm a man whose mind is captivated by the quest for the unknown.
Are you familiar with "Void's Island"?
Void's Island" is a space that can be visited irregularly through <cf>star vein holes.
There, somehow, monsters appear that are so powerful that they are incomparably <cf>more powerful than normal!
If left unchecked, they may escape from the floating islands. <cf>That is why a large number of adventurers are giving top priority to defeating them!
The Pioneer Bureau is also taking utmost precautions against the appearance of <cf>star vein holes that lead to "Void's Island".
It is such a dangerous and peculiar place. <cf>But why and where does such a place exist?
I am eager to solve the mystery of this place!
Void's Island" must also be somewhere in Regnus. <cf>But I have no idea where it is.
No matter how many old documents, maps, and adventurers' search records <cf>we checked, the location of the floating island remained unclear!
So here it is. <cf>I want you to join the battle at "Void's Island".
The demi-dragons that appear in "Void's Island" are thought to produce <cf>a special substance in their bodies.
It's called "The Evening Color Crystal of the False Dragon". <cf>I want you to get this.
It's a clue about "Void's Island." <cf>You should be able to get it by defeating the demi-dragon.
I'll give you a special case. <cf>I want you to take it home in this.
Just to be clear, you can only get it from the <cf>demi-dragon that appears on "Void's Island".
The star vein hole will appear in "Andra Basin". <cf>Other adventurers will gather then.
Without a doubt, this battle will be a fight to the death. <cf>Make sure you are well prepared before you take on this challenge.
Defeat the demi-dragon on "Void's Island" and get the <cf>"Void's Dragon's Evening Color Crystal" for me.
The star vein hole leading to "Void's Island" appears at <cf>"Andra Basin". I'm counting on you!
It is a star vein hole that leads to "Void's Island."
The presence of a strong enemy is in the air at ....... <cf>Once inside, a fight will be inevitable.
Hahahahaha!　That went well! <cf>Thank you, adventurers!
The "False Dragon's Evening Color Crystal" you obtained, <cf>this is the first time I've been able to see the real thing!
The "Yusai Shokusyo" rapidly disintegrates once it leaves the floating island. <cf>Therefore, it was impossible to transport it to the city.
So I co-developed a memory stand and case. <cf>It was half a gamble whether it would work or not. ......
That's wonderful! <cf>You and I witnessed a historic moment!
This is just my hypothesis: ......
There is no clear difference between the monsters that appear on Void's Island and those that live near <cf>the city.
Then why is it only in "Void's Island" <cf>that it becomes so powerful?
That's because the place itself, "Void's Island" <cf>gives power to the monsters!
The monster's body, with its accumulated power, <cf>will surely change.
That is what you brought back, the "Evening Color Crystal of the False Dragon"!
Of course, this one thing will not solve the mystery. <cf>But it is a major step forward in my research!
Thank you!　I would like to thank <cf>you both as a researcher and as a member of the Bureau!
The battle in "Void's Island" is extremely fierce. <cf>The Pioneering Bureau is well aware of this point.
So in addition to the regular rewards, <cf>we're offering additional rewards based on contributions!
There are many ways to contribute. <cf>You should find a form that fits your style.
Of course, it's not too much to ask. <cf>If we fail to defeat them, there's no way to get rid of them.
The Pioneer Bureau is looking for adventurers to fight in "Void's Island"! <cf>Join forces and fight off the mighty monsters!
I'll do a thorough investigation of "The Evening Color Crystal of the False Dragon". <cf>It will be some time before we get the results.
You should join the big battle too, <cf>and hone your skills.
The Pioneer Bureau is counting on you adventurers to do well. <cf>Of course, I feel the same way!
I still like the ...... desert. ...... <cf>All those fascinating stones. ......
Come to think of it, my ...... journey started in the ...... desert, too.
Around here, ...... I first encountered the stone ....... <cf>The "Coarse Ore" is lying ......
It's not a rare ...... thing, but ......, <cf>it's a stone that I have ...... feelings about. ......
I was picking up rocks and ...... <cf>suddenly remembered ...... that I wanted to see ...... again. ......
Could you get me about 20 pieces of "Coarse Ore" ...... <cf>?
It's a small stone. ...... <cf>They're beautiful when packed in small bottles. ...... I miss them.
You should be able to extract ...... 'crude ore' at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>'
Desert monsters are too ...... tough for me ...... <cf>to go get them. ......
I never used to be so ...... annoyed <cf>by ...... monsters before.
Speaking of which, I was looking for ...... rocks and picked up some interesting ...... <cf>stuff. ......
It's a bottle of liquid memory. ...... <cf>Let me trade this one for the "crude ore" ....... ......
I'll look into the ...... effect before I come back. <cf>Whatever it is, it should help. ......
I've got 20 ...... "Coarse Ores" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>". <cf>I'm asking you to ......
Liquid memory bin ...... <cf>I'll check ...... before I replace it. ......
Oh ......, it's "Coarse Ore" ....... <cf>It's beautiful when you collect it. I miss it. ......
It looks ...... like an ordinary stone, doesn't it......? <cf>That's right, ...... it's just an ordinary stone. ......
But to me ...... it's an unusual stone ....... <cf>Can you understand this feeling......
When I was a child,...... I saw things that were ordinary,...... <cf>but special to me,...... and shining... ...
I collected them in secret and ...... made them my own personal treasures. <cf>Don't you remember that kind of ......?
I was so ...... this stone. <cf>It was the ...... first step in falling in love with the stone. ......
It reminds me of the old days at ....... Thanks ......
It's the promised ...... liquid memory bin. ...... <cf>Make it ...... work for you.
You can use this: ...... <cf>"Bonus for earning GC when completing missions" ......
Seems to activate ...... by 'challenging Arena'
Maybe it brings good luck. ...... <cf>Some stones are said to do so: ......
Maybe one day, someone will be ...... enthralled by this bin and ...... <cf>feel the way I do now. ......
I heard that sometimes you can get ...... a bottle of ...... liquid memory as a <cf>reward for a request from the Pioneer Bureau.
It's ...... good to look for. <cf>Things are worth ...... each person's .......
Oh?　You wanted to see me?
I am rarely approached by people. ...... <cf>I see, you have a strange phase.
There are people who need your help. <cf>Please listen to us all!
My name is Zoe. <cf>I am a fortune teller and a merchant.
We deal in rare items and do not accept monetary transactions. <cf>We are known for our eccentricities. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
We knew you were here from <cf>fortune-telling.
When you are in distress, salvation will come to you. <cf>With those words, I saw your image in my mind.
As a matter of fact, we are in trouble.
A pregnant woman in our neighborhood has a very dangerous phase. <cf>There is a strong possibility of disaster in the near future.
We need to give them a good luck remedy while we are at it. ......
I can't get a flower called "Mother Green" for it <cf>
This is a very difficult flower to obtain <cf>that only blooms in front of a select few.
Not even on the market in Asterleeds!
But you will find it. <cf>The fact that you have heard my request is proof of that.
Mother Green" grows wild in the Bahamar Highland at <cf><value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>
It will blossom in front of you. <cf>Please go and collect them.
Mother Green" grows wild in the Bahamar Highland at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>How was your visit to "Mother Green"?
Oh, ......!　This is indeed "Mother Green"! <cf>Thank you.
This flower has the power to protect the mother's womb. <cf>It is not a kind of spell, but really
If we had not arrived in time, both mother and child would have been in danger. <cf>Thank you so much, Mr. Adventurer!
I knew the phase you had in mind was <cf>
Being selected as "Mother Green" means that <cf>you will have a tumultuous road ahead of you!
It may help you along the way. <cf>Please take this one.
Liquid memory bottle. <cf>It can "Reduce the Luno consumption of weapon crafting".
By "defeating the monster" <cf>we will also activate the liquid memory here!
It's somewhat unusual, so <cf>please don't say too much about it publicly: ......
I am thus <cf>trading in items that are not available to the public!
Mother Green" is one of them. <cf>This is also why I do not accept monetary transactions.
You are a special person <cf>when you are approached by me!
Thank you very much for this opportunity. <cf>We will continue to support you on your path.
If you have a chance to meet me, again. <cf>I hope you will listen to what I have to say.
Liquid memory bins are also a valuable reward for <cf>requests
I have heard that the bottles I presented to <cf>sometimes end up in the hands of adventurers!
Please take a look at the Pioneer Bureau's request. <cf>We may have a story that can help you.
Thank you <cf>for accepting my request!
Oh, did I say that a little wrong? <cf>I'm starting to understand some of the customer service terms.
Oh well. <cf>I'm tired, so I'll talk in my usual tone!
Our drinks are very popular. <cf>We run out of bottles very quickly.
So, I'm going to order materials. <cf>This is complicated, and to be honest, I don't really understand it.
So, if you are in trouble, Mr. Adventurer!
Why don't we just ask adventurers to collect them? <cf>I'm so smart!
What I want is "Coast Glass". <cf>But I've never seen it for sale in a store.
If they sold them normally, I could buy them, too. <cf>I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of ordering.
So, please, adventurers! <cf>Go find the "Coast Glass"!
If you can't find it in the store, how about the Pioneering Bureau? <cf>I heard they keep all kinds of materials.
Hit that one first! <cf>Whatever you can get your hands on.
I'll get you another bottle of liquid memory, <cf>, as a thank you.
Okay, now I'm an order master too! <cf>I'm looking forward to working with you, adventurer!
I've been asked to place an order for "Coast Glass." <cf>Anyway, if I can get it ready, I'll be OK.
Adventurers, you can find <cf>"Coast Glass" anywhere!
The Pioneer Bureau keeps all sorts of materials there, <cf>I'd suggest you ask them there.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you at the Pioneer Station?
...... I see. <cf>I'm looking for "Coast Glass," and
It's certainly a material that the Pioneer Bureau keeps in storage. <cf>They use it for building exteriors, heritage restorations, etc.
But I'm stumped. I'd love to help, but <cf>what we have now is what we're planning to use.
It takes a bit of work to collect, and it's not something you can find in <cf>stores. ......
Sorry. <cf>I think it would be faster to find it myself.
The Coast Glass was found at <cf>in the Reikrid Tunnels.
It's where we're going for the Adventurer Registration Test. <cf>You're probably familiar with it, aren't you?
You should be able to get it if you search deep into that place. <cf>We'll have to get it locally, but thank you in advance.
You can get "Coast Glass" by exploring the Reikrid Tunnels at <cf>
It's where I'm headed for my adventurer registration exam, so I don't think I'll get lost at <cf>
Sorry, but I need you to get it on your own. <cf>Deliver it straight to my client.
Ah, "Coast Glass"! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
That's great, you're doing it! <cf>I'll give you a bottle of liquid memory as a thank you!
The effect is to "increase the selling price of materials". <cf>Nice!　A very good deal!
It's going to be useful for adventurers, isn't it? <cf>I've finished placing the order, so I'm all set!
Pattern-wise, it looks like your sister will be here soon. <cf>I won't have to be lectured this time!
Yes, I did. I was watching from the middle, Patty.
Hey, sister! <cf>How's it going?　My order is perfect, isn't it?
Don't go through all that trouble. <cf>Just ask the adventurers from the beginning.
Yes, you are right, ....... <cf>My fault for not explaining it properly.
Patti. I keep track of the store's inventory and order counts to make sure there are no <cf>mistakes!
It is a matter of money. <cf>It involves wholesalers' purchases and sales, as well as their credibility.
You should never prepare it without going through the store. <cf>I should have made it clear that ......
And I didn't know. ...... <cf>That's why they were such a pain in the ass!
Don't be mendacious. <cf>[--]Don't think only of the easy things.
<span size="Big">Heyo! &lt;/&gt;
Dear Adventurer. Thank you <cf>for doing Patty a favor.
We will be very grateful to <cf>for the "Coast Glass" you provided.
Of course, the adventurer is not at fault. <cf>Please make use of the liquid memory jars as well!
Yes, Patty. Say hello.
Thank you very much! <cf>We look forward to serving you in the future!
...... I'll need to teach you how to use language later.
Ohhhhh, no way!
Liquid Memory is available at <cf>　Mr. Adventurer
Hmmm, something doesn't feel right. ...... <cf>Wording is difficult~.
Liquid memory that makes anyone speak polite, <cf>You could sell it in your store ......
Are you interested in fishing?
Take a break from adventures and <cf>earn some extra money with the fish you catch!
I recommend it as a hobby for adventurers! <cf>If you are interested, please give me another call!
Are you interested in fishing? <cf>That's very good!
My name is Andor. I'm an angler. <cf>I want people to know the charm of fishing.
It's fun to play with the fish across the water. <cf>It's a great way to take a break from your adventures!
Hmm?　First time fishing? <cf>Hahaha, no problem!
I will give you a lecture on <cf>everything from choosing the right location to tips on how to catch fish!
First of all, fishing can't be done everywhere. <cf>There are good 'spots' where you can catch fish.
Try the marina in the harbor. <cf>You'll find a spot to fish.
When fishing, be careful of the 'tension' of the fishing line. <cf>Too much tension will break it and the fish will escape.
If you reel it in, you'll catch fish, but if that's all you do, <cf>you'll soon get excited.
In such a case, you have to tilt the rod in the direction where the fish are. <cf>You can loosen the tension.
Keep your eyes on the water and stay calm. <cf>If you reel in and pull the fish to your hand, ......
Good!　Great catch, congrats!
Sometimes you can catch something other than fish. <cf>It seems you can get items that are more practical than you might think.
The fish and items you catch will be sent to the warehouse. <cf>Don't forget to check them!
Well then, I want you to catch three "Aster Koaji". <cf>I hope you'll take this opportunity to learn the names of the fish.
You can also catch "aster horse mackerels" of different sizes and purchase prices at <cf>but make no mistake!
The target this time is "Aster Koaji". <cf>I'll be waiting in anticipation. Good luck!
Oh, you want a refresher on fishing? <cf>Leave it to me!
Fishing is done in spots where you can catch fish. <cf>Just go to the marina and you'll find them.
Reel in the fishing line, paying attention to the tension of the line. <cf>If I tilt the rod toward the fish, the tension will loosen.
If you can pull the fish to your hand, you can catch it.
My goal is to catch 3 "Aster Koa Ji". <cf>Don't mistake them for any other fish. Good luck!
Oh, welcome back! <cf>Looks like you had a good catch.
Yeah, all the fish are good! <cf>You're pretty good at that.
You can go to the spot and fish whenever you want. <cf>Enjoy yourself whenever you want.
It is good to fish alone. <cf>It is also fun to fish with a large group of friends!
If you are an adventurer, you can compete with your team to see how many fish you can catch. <cf>You can also play like a sport fisherman!
You can sell the fish you catch for money. <cf>Adventurers are always in short supply.
If fishing becomes more popular, <cf>we may find new uses for the fish we catch!
It's fun and profitable! <cf>Fishing is such a good leisure!
I hope you too can spread the word about fishing! <cf>Keep up the good fishing!
Hey, are you fishing today?
Enjoy it alone!　Enjoy fishing alone or with a crowd! <cf>There are endless ways to enjoy fishing!
Enjoy your good fishing life!
I hear that in each class <cf>lies untapped potential.
To take you to greater heights, <cf>I will continue my quest and study!
Someday, when fate shows you where you'll end up, <cf>you can visit me again.
[--]Hmmm, you've got your arm up.
Competence shows in the way you behave. <cf>Your manners are refined and beautiful.
You have accumulated experience and solid strength. <cf>I can see your journey so far.
Then I will take you to greater heights.
I'm going to teach you something called <cf>"Tactical Abilities".
Techniques that enhance the skills of each class can greatly expand the range and possibilities of <cf>fighting
However, it requires a certain level of competence to master.
Can you really use your tactical abilities? <cf>Let me see once again with my own eyes.
Do you know "Giant Tower Ruins?" <cf>I want you to step through these ruins.
It will not be a difficult task. <cf>I'm watching the fight from a distance.
I hope your path will be paved. <cf>Good luck!
Let me see if you can master your tactical abilities <cf>with your own eyes!
Try "Giant Tower Ruins, Investigation."
I don't think it's a difficult assignment. <cf>Be on your guard.
I see you have returned from "Giant Tower Ruins. <cf>I have watched your battle with great interest.
It's really brilliant. <cf>It seems my eyes were not mistaken.
Now let me tell you about Tactical Abilities <cf>
Tactical abilities will be taught by me. <cf>Come visit me when you are ready.
You will need "The Fighter's Talisman" <cf>to do so. Don't forget it.
The Warrior's Talisman is <cf>a fragment of an ancient text on the ancient martial arts.
I collect them for further study of martial arts. <cf>I get tips on skills and other martial arts.
As we continue our exploration, we may unlock another new martial art masterpiece <cf>
The "Trooper's Talisman" should be available through the <cf>adventure board.
Check with the Pioneer Bureau for requests, etc. <cf>There will be an adventure board available as a reward.
Tactical Abilities are <cf>that there are more than just the ones I give you.
As you conquer your journey, there may be some things you can gain <cf>on a moment's notice.
Be greatly encouraged and seek them out!
Hope the tactical abilities will help <cf>get you through the tough battles.
Well, here you are. <cf>You have been working out without neglect, and that is truly good.
Have you utilized the class change since then?
Experience in more than one class will give <cf>you a better insight into the classes in which you excel.
However, there are some things that may be troubling. <cf>One of them is the time it takes to grow.
Every time you cross two or three classes, <cf>it becomes harder and harder to expect dramatic growth.
I recognize this as an issue that I have been working on for years.
I have been giving it a lot of thought. ...... <cf>One solution has recently been put in place.
I'm sure it will help you too.
[But we do not want to teach it too easily. <cf>It is a means that has a somewhat strong effect.
Do you have the power worth using? <cf>I promised you that it would be my job to find out.
The challenge is "Rush Battle, 3rd level". <cf>I hope you can make it through this with flying colors.
I will tell you the details then. <cf>I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
I'd like you to try "Rush Battle, 3rd level" and get through <cf>this.
If you have that power, <cf>you are well qualified to use the solution I have taken.
I'll tell you the details after we get through the rush battle. <cf>I wish you good luck in your endeavors.
It was brilliant. <cf>I watched you fight.
Now let's talk about <cf>means to help your class grow!
The Pioneer Bureau and Memory Stand have recently collaborated to create <cf>a new liquid memory.
It's the one that gives you the <cf>effect of 'more experience gained at lower levels.'
With this, you can expect <cf>quick growth when trying out new classes!
Of course, the effect will not last forever. <cf>It's just until they achieve a certain level of growth.
That said, I think <cf>would be a big help in expanding the range of classes and fighting styles
After this, you can go to the memory stand. <cf>They should have a selection of liquid memory.
Due to its high effectiveness, it is considered a burden to the body and mind. <cf>This liquid memory is not recommended for everyone.
I made sure you have the power to do this. <cf>I hope you make good use of it and get to know the different classes.
Class change and liquid memory. <cf>There are many others that could be of help to you.
Don't get caught up in one thing, broaden your horizons. <cf>Challenging yourself with a wide range of challenges can be fun.
That should be the <cf>necessary attitude to aim high!
Adventurers are often asked for unusual items <cf>
Many things like grass and rocks are not sold at the stores I go to <cf>......
Let's see, next is "Quartz Gemstones" ....... <cf>Do you carry this in your jewelry?
Hello, my name is Marguerite and I am a new adventurer. <cf>My name is Marguerite, and I am a new adventurer.
Actually, I'd like to discuss a request we've accepted <cf>
I've been asked to collect <cf>materials called "crystal gemstones" and "Gloken Seeds" ......
I couldn't find it anywhere. <cf>I'm stumped!
My family is descended from nobility. It has been our family tradition for generations to be adventurers and to <cf>broaden our horizons!
That's why the [contacts] I know are not adventurers and <cf>are not useful for this request!
For example, if you are looking for a "rough crystal", <cf>I asked my close friend, Jewelry, to order it for me.
It's not jewelry, it's a material used for weapons, so <cf>jewelry stores don't carry it.
I've never heard of "Glaucon Seed" <cf>, either edible or ornamental!
So, I would like to ask you, my seniors, to help me collect <cf>materials.
Of course, I will continue my search. <cf>But that would keep the client waiting.
Our first priority is to deliver the materials. <cf>Please cooperate with us!
Three "crystal gemstones" and two "Gloken Seeds". <cf>That should be enough for your request.
I look forward to working with you. <cf>I, for one, will consult with the Pioneering Bureau.
You are requesting three "Crystal Gemstones" and two <cf>"Gloken Seeds".
I'll continue to look for it, but <cf>I'm afraid it's going to take an embarrassingly long time!
Our first priority is to deliver the product to the client. <cf>Please cooperate with us!
I see that you have collected "Crystal Gemstones" and "Gloken Seeds", <cf>. Thank you.
This will save my client a lot of waiting. <cf>Thank you again.
I also consulted with the Pioneer Bureau and heard an interesting story at <cf>
The "Mounted Caravan" program is being started at <cf>by the Bureau of Reclamation.
First, <cf>requests to borrow Mount Imagine will be collected by the Pioneering Bureau
Adventurers can register their Mount Imagine at <cf>and we'll send them on that request!
Now all they have to do is wait and they can complete the request and get the <cf>materials, etc.
If you have a lot of Mount Imagine, you can dispatch them to more places and requests than <cf>and it's a win-win!
They say the Pioneer Bureau is responsible for these.
You can rest assured that the Mount Imagine will not become unusable or <cf>worn out!
I've also been told by the Pioneer Bureau to make active use of the "Mounted Caravan" at <cf>
I don't have a Mount Imagine yet, but I will definitely make use of it when I get my hands on <cf>!
This request could have been resolved on its own at <cf>if it were a "mounted caravan", and
Today was a very productive day for me. <cf>Thank you so much.
We will continue to devote ourselves to this project. <cf>I wish you a good journey.
To use "Mounted Caravan" you have to get <cf>Mounted Imagine!
You already have one, and if you have more than one, I recommend <cf>to make the most of them.
I need to find the first one. <cf>Is it possible to order it from some store?
My friend has asked me to do something for him. <cf>I'm working on a new magic trick!
[I'd like to see the explosion system <cf>or the amputation system ......
Hmmm, this is troubling! <cf>This is not a good time to work!
Welcome, adventurer! <cf>First of all, look this way.
Here is one weapon.
One bottle is ...... <span size="Big">hmmm! &lt;/&gt;
It breaks easily like this.
However!　These three weapon engrams. <cf>Combine them into one and you get ......?
Like this! <cf>What a lot of power for three weapons in one weapon!
This makes it easy to defeat even the peskiest Mook Scout! <cf>Plus ...... humph!
As you can see, it disappeared and disappeared without a trace!
All right!　It worked! <cf>How was my new disappearance magic?
I am Ranveil, an engineer at the Imagine Institute and <cf>a genius magician!
My friend Huovi asked me to do it. <cf>I was inventing a new magic trick.
I have now fulfilled my promise to my friend! <cf>Here's what I'm going to ask you to do.
Actually, my colleague asked me <cf>to take down a Mook Scout as well.
By the magic of earlier, the weapon I brought with me <cf>broke or disappeared and is gone.
Even though it is vanishing magic, I never thought it would really disappear. <cf>My natural gift, I am afraid. ......
However, it would be reckless to take on the challenge without a weapon. <cf>So, we ask you, adventurers, to help us defeat them.
Of course, we'll pay you. <cf>That's right!　I'll even tell you the seeds of that magic trick I mentioned earlier.
It is an application of a technique called "breaking through the limits. <cf>It's a way to collect and enhance multiple weapons.
It will be useful to you, the adventurer! <cf>So, I asked you to take them down!
I'll take care of the weapons in the meantime. <cf>On second thought, they were on loan from a colleague of mine.
Head to "Sunlit Timberpath, Free Exploration". <cf>The target Mook Scout should be there.
Nice to meet you, adventurer! <cf>May you not disappear like magic!
The target Mook Scout can be found at <cf>"Sunlit Timberpath, Free Exploration"!
As an adventurer, I'm sure you can take them down. <cf>We'll even pay you a decent reward, so please do us a favor.
Now I must do something about my missing weapon. <cf>No, can't I just use ...... magic to get it out of somewhere?
Oh, you adventurer! <cf>Looks like you took down a Mook Scout.
No, you saved me. Thank you, my benefactor!
My friend Huovi told me about it. <cf>I heard that the weapon he snapped off was an expensive one.
[It takes a lot of time to make a new one, right? <cf>Wouldn't it be wiser to just back out for a while? ["]]
Following the advice of my friend, [--], <cf>I decided to go on a trip until the heat of the moment had cooled off!
But first, I have a promise to keep! <cf>I'll tell you the secret of the magic trick I just showed you.
<span size="Big">Yes!　It's "Pushing the Limits"! &lt;/&gt;
The "breaking the limit" is a method of strengthening the same weapon or Imagine by overlapping <cf>each other.
First, choose the weapon or Imagine you want to enhance <cf>and prepare the same.
And don't forget the auxiliary materials dedicated to "breaking the limits."
For weapons, you can go to the Tenshi Kusei Ritual, and for Imagine, you can go to the Imagine Laboratory at <cf>and "push the limits"!
If successful, you can consume the superimposed weapon or Imagine to enhance <cf>the objective.
Sometimes they fail. The auxiliary materials will be gone, but don't worry, <cf>the weapons and Imagine will remain.
In the case of my magic, I just lost <cf>because I folded it normally. Hahaha!
Pushing the "envelope" makes it worthwhile to craft <cf>the same weapon or Imagine!
You may even get weapons and other items during your adventure. <cf>Consider yourself lucky!
Well, it's time to go away. <cf>I haven't seen or talked to you!　Okay?
[--]Then you'll meet with me and we'll talk, won't we?
<span size="Big">That voice! &lt;/&gt; My friend's sister, Poirier!
I had a bad feeling because of the slow return. <cf>Ranveer. Did you take care of the hit I asked you to take down?
No problem. <cf>My grateful adventurers have taken care of it!
What about the weapon I lent you?
It was a victim of our new magic! <cf>Oh, if it's a broken remnant, I've got it right here.
<span size="Big">..................&lt;/&gt;
You hey ......!　How many of those do you think you get every time! <cf>How much do you think your weird hobby costs!
Wait! <cf>Before we talk, why don't we take a look at my magic?
Magic that makes you disappear somewhere?
<span size="Big">So! &lt;/&gt;
You know where you're going, of course you're going to the reflection room at the institute! <cf>Pick up the wreckage there and come quickly!
My friend's sister is pretty tough.
I'm going to be stuck in the lab <cf>cleaning and doing other chores!
We have no choice but to go to ....... <cf>Let's work on some new escape magic stuff!
I, Ciri, am an apprentice restorer of Bapharia's heritage. <cf>I'm inspecting the rolling ball kneading ritual right now.
I took a quick look at <cf>and the lubricant in the internal mechanism is about to run out.
But, you know, the amount I can buy with the budget I have <cf>doesn't seem to be enough.
What?　Can we add to the budget? <cf>No, no, no, don't poke that sore spot.
To begin with, an apprentice is ...... such a complicated legacy <cf>that it hurts!　It hurts!
Because it can't be helped. <cf>My teacher said, "["]You want to try it? [I'll try it.
[I can afford it!　I'll clean it up for half the usual price, and ["] <cf>I'm so vain and I've got a big mouth.
Wow!　Don't be a jerk! <cf>I just wanted to show you something nice!
Don't worry. I've thought of a countermeasure. <cf>We'll use the "heat plants" that grow in the desert.
That, you can get almost the same ingredients as lubricant. <cf>Surprising, isn't it?
I didn't have a lot of money back in the day, so I tried <cf>a lot of different things for research material.
Ten bottles will do for the time being. <cf>In the meantime, I'll make sure you're properly lubricated.
I can't tell my ...... mentor, so I'll have to sneak something <cf>to work to make up for it.
Anyway, if this stops, everyone will be in trouble. <cf>That's the only thing we have to avoid.
Please!　Hey? <cf>Nice to meet you!
The 'heat plants' that take the place of lubricants are growing at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"
I need you to go get some. <cf>Please!　Pleased to meet you!
Hmph. ....... <cf>It's okay, it's okay. I'm a woman who's good at her job.
This sweat is because of the heat. Don't get me wrong. <cf>I'm not sweating cold sweat or anything like that at all.
No, you see. <cf>I was messing around with the rolling ball training ritual while I was waiting.
<span size="Big">It made a nice sound! &lt;/&gt; I heard a nice sound. This again.
And when I looked at it, I found that some of the precision parts were <cf>very badly damaged.
The apprentice was in full swing <cf>and it wasn't something he was allowed to touch.
Mooo!　It would have been a piece of cake to at least have a car. <cf>It's a pity!
I went to the trouble of bringing you a heat plant. <cf>This will stop even if I only have lubricant. Sorry!
I was not just curious! <cf>I know that sounds like an excuse, but I have my reasons.
Salamzart has an arid climate, <cf>so sand often gets in and destroys our heritage.
So I thought I'd clean it while I'm at it: ....... <cf>But my arms weren't good enough......
...... Oh! <cf>That's right. Master's Notes!
[Take it with you just in case ["]"] was given to me! <cf>Maybe there's something in here.
I found ......!　You can find damaged "planetary gears" at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>
Um, I'm sorry, but ...... <cf>can I ask you to do this with me too?
According to the Master's notes: ......
It looks like "Planetary Gear" will be dropped by <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E024_00_00_02001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>"
I feel very bad without it. ...... <cf>Please!　No, please!
New "Planetary Gear"!　Thank you! <cf>I'll replace it right away.
...... Okay, the replacement is complete. <cf>Now you are good to go. Ha, thank goodness.
Now I can report to my mentor that ["]I was able to afford it ["]. <cf>I'll just say that I didn't ...... have any trouble.
Well, you know what? <cf>If you ever see your mentor, would you please shut up?
My master is a very good restorer. <cf>So I have to be as good as he is... well, you know... ......
I'm going to be honest when it comes to ...... <cf>I don't want my mentor to think I'm a bad guy!
Because my master is my idol. <cf>Even though he is sometimes sloppy and a dull uncle.
But it's cool that they are restoring heritage sites! <cf>There are so many other cool places to visit!
I don't want to lose my other students. <cf>I'm the only one who knows the good things about my master. ......
So, hey, you know?　Please!　Don't tell anyone! <cf>I'm begging you for the rest of my life~!
Did you nod your head at ......?　Did you just nod reluctantly? <cf>That means you're OK with it, right?
Thank goodness~!　Thanks! <cf>You covered my pokey.
If you ever bring in a legacy <cf>I'll secretly give you a discount.
Don't worry. <cf>I'll soon become a really good at my job!
I'm Remigio, the future great merchant! <cf>There's no harm in ingratiating myself with you!
No, ...... sorry, I apologize. <cf>I get carried away like this and it's not good.
Actually, I lied to people in an effort to look good. <cf>I owe you an apology for that.
But I just couldn't find the courage to do it. ......
The other guy is Dr. Sai in Larpal. <cf>Sometimes he teaches me at the mansion.
He is very strict and scary! <cf>I don't like to go near him if I can help it.
I'd be more afraid if he didn't apologize for this. ......
If someone is willing to come with me, <cf>I'll try to do my best to make it work!　I think ......
Please, together with me, apologize to Dr. Sai! <cf>Also, please keep an eye on me so I don't run away!
I'm sorry too! <cf>Share your courage and strength with me!
The person I want to apologize to is Dr. Sai in Larpal. <cf>Please. Apologize with me.
I must ask for forgiveness with the utmost apology. ...... <cf>I guess I'm still 'on my knees'. ......
Oh?　Mr. Remigio and Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
I think we need to talk about something. ...... <cf>Mr. Remigio. Don't you have something to do first?
Sorry about that!　Dr. Sai!
That was Mr. Remigio of Salamzart, wasn't it? <cf>Now, what are we talking about?
The story I told you the other day when you came with my dad <cf>["]getting married["] is a lie!
I don't like being treated like a child, so I just go to ....... <cf> I don't want to be treated like a child, so I end up going to  and saying things like, "[I'm] a grown-up ["][I'm getting married soon ["].
That was a lie! <cf>I am so sorry!
[--]Everyone wants to make themselves look bigger than they are. <cf>Even adults often put up a false front.
And you are still a child. <cf>You may want to grow taller.
[--]But I'm not impressed with lies.
<span size="Big">Hiiii! &lt;/&gt;
Nevertheless, it is good that you came to apologize yourself.
I will also spare the adventurers who bowed with me. <cf>From now on, be careful. No further questions will be asked.
Oh thank you for ......!
Thanks a lot! <cf>You made me apologize to Dr. Rhino.
Mr. Remigio. I am fine with this, but <cf>isn't there one more person you owe an apology to?
The lies you told <cf>seem to be more pervasive than you think.
I'm sure that 'marriage partner' is also <cf>annoyed with you.
What? <cf>Other than the teacher, that lie!
What should I do? The guy I said I'd marry is Isial from <cf>Asterleeds.
If this lie is spreading <cf>I owe Isial an apology!
Ahhh, but what can I say. ...... <cf>Sorry ....... Can you apologize with me again?
I feel like I can properly apologize if you're with me! <cf>Let's hurry up and go to Asterleeds!
It seems Mr. Remigio's lies are more pervasive than <cf>thought.
I heard that you told Lord Isial of Asterleeds that he was <cf>your marriage partner, etc.
We should also apologize to Lord Isial. <cf>Dear Adventurer. I would like you to accompany him.
Huh ....... I wonder who on earth started all this talk about me getting married <cf>
Oh, Mr. Remigio?　And the adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
Mr. Isial!　Sorry!
What, Mr. Remigio? <cf>What on earth are you talking about?
I heard that the lie about me marrying Mr. Isial is spreading <cf>......
Sorry to bother you!
Ah! <cf>That was a lie you told me!
No wonder I thought it was strange. <cf>Here and there, people would say ["]congratulations on your marriage["].
Even though I don't remember it at all, <cf>my father would say to me, ["]Introduce me to the man you're going to marry! [I'm not sure if I'm supposed to...
It's been a tough time already.
I didn't know that even happened!
I'm really sorry! <cf>I didn't think you'd make such a big deal out of it.
When I was here before, you were so kind to me <cf>I just mentioned Isial's name ......
So that's what you meant. <cf>I understand. That's enough.
And if you talk to me properly, we can clear up the misunderstanding. <cf>But please don't do it again.
I won't do it again!
I'd like to say I'm sorry, but <cf>I'll give your father a proper explanation from me!
It's going to get more complicated. <cf>That's fine, but ......
Yes. Could you please go to <cf>and return the gift that Yuska sent you?
He is a boy who loves books and I talk to him a lot. <cf>The other day he gave me a gift out of the blue.
I'm sure somewhere along the line, you heard Mr. Remigio's lies and <cf>believed them.
But, Yuska, he hasn't come to <cf>visit me once since then.
When I saw you the other day, you looked gloomy. <cf>If there's something troubling you, I'd like you to talk to me about it.
Well, that's not good. ...... I feel like I hurt that Yuska <cf>so bad!
I have to return the gift to Mr. Isial and <cf>give him a proper explanation from me!
...... I guess I need to apologize, yeah. <cf>Sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to hang out with me a little longer!
Please return the gift you received from Mr. Yuska to <cf>
Please tell him the truth too. <cf>He should be in Asterleeds.
Huh. ...... <cf>Isial, you're getting married. ......
I'm shocked. ...... <cf>It's hard to go to the pioneer station now.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. Hello ....... <cf>You have a delivery for me?
Huh?　That's the one I gave to Isial: ......
Sorry about that!
The story about Isial getting married is a lie I told <cf>!
As such, I stand corrected and apologize!
Oh, it was a lie!
I see though ....... <cf>Mr. Isial is not getting married. Good.
I'm sorry I lied to you and caused you trouble. <cf>I'm sorry I even got you a present!
That's fine. <cf>I have a lot of kids who have been taking care of Mr. Isial.
We're all talking about celebrating together. <cf>We're getting ready for the party right now.
I think you should tell them the truth too.
Is the story getting louder here too! <cf>Oh no, we have to stop this as soon as possible!
Let's find a venue to prepare for the party! <cf>We need to find it fast and apologize!
...... if you don't apologize, right? ...... right? <cf>Please, bow down with me!
We're celebrating Isial's wedding at <cf>and we're all getting ready for the party.
I think you should tell her the truth soon and apologize to her at <cf>
How wonderful that Isial is getting married. <cf>Let's celebrate it in a big way!
I long to be married! <cf>I wonder what kind of man he would be like.
<span size="Big">I'm sorry! &lt;/&gt;
Whoa!　Who's there?
Mr. Isial never got married! <cf>That was a lie I told!
I just wanted to be a little taller <cf>and put some words out of my mouth ......
I'm sorry I went to all the trouble to prepare for you! <cf>It's all my fault for lying!
Nah. That was a lie.
You're right, I didn't hear it directly from Mr. Isial at <cf>.
Oh, you're such a buzzkill. <cf>I was so excited to see the bride.
But I'm glad you told me before we started.
Our sincere apologies ....... <cf>We are sorry.
That's enough. Don't worry about it so much.
Now surprise me with a true story.
Aaahhh!　I'm not going to look good anymore! <cf>I'm just a kid, and I'm not getting married!
You really got me into trouble too! <cf>I'm sorry you had to go along with my lies!
You've come to just the right place. <cf>Sorry. Just a job for me, please.
Well, you know, it's embarrassing.
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>I was going at it with <cf>and suddenly a Landhawk came down.
They took my weapons. <cf>See, they like shiny things, don't they?
Thanks to this, I can't do my own requests anymore. <cf>I was collecting " <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>'s triangular scales."
I need five more. <cf>I need you to take them over.
When you're done, put it all together and deliver it to Isial at <cf>Salamzart.
They should be near the Pioneer Station. <cf>My client is at the pioneer station. What did he say: ......
["] <cf>doesn't work when I touch the [tip(sentan)] of <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, so I need you to collect the scales ["]......, right?
I don't know, but you don't listen to me, so <cf>you're supposed to chastise me, probably.
Well then, I'm asking you. <cf>You can have all the money.
We need five more " <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>triangle scales".
["] <cf>doesn't work when I touch the tip of <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, so I need you to collect the scales ["]......, right?
My client, Isial, said something like that. <cf>I don't know how many times I remember it, but I don't know what it means: ......
Well, I know what I'm going to collect. <cf>I'll just have to teach him a lesson and he'll be fine.
Oh, and by the way, if you go to <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, you'll find me at <cf>( <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>).
Isial is at the pioneer station, <cf>so when you're done, just deliver it all together.
Wow ...... I've heard stories about this <cf>It's a really hot city!
The book will get sunburned too. ...... <cf>We'll return to Asterleeds as soon as we're done with the survey.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can I help you?
...... on behalf of Mr. Durga to deliver <cf>"The Triangular Scales of <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>"?
Thank you for that. <cf>Yes, I certainly received it.
Huh?　You want to hear about the request?
["] <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>[tip(sheen)] of <cf>Touching it doesn't work, so ["]......?
Oh, is that what Mr. Durga said? <cf>Oh my god, that guy is ......
I explained that ["] <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>may have an organ that [detects] [living organisms] at <cf>, so ["].
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>can accurately locate prey underground, in the dark, and in other areas with poor visibility <cf>
It is assumed that this is because the special organs that detect living organisms are <cf>separate from the eyes and ears!
I decided to base my research on this hypothesis. <cf>So I asked him to collect research materials.
Hopefully, this could be applied to technology to detect and <cf>keep monsters away!
Once again, thank you for your cooperation!
Oh, yes. Excuse me. <cf>Can I ask you one more thing?
I want you to go back to "Hermit's Fountain" <cf>and check on Mr. Durga.
She's a bit of a dangerous person. <cf>I'm worried she's doing something reckless.
Please let me know that the request has been completed and I will be fine. <cf>Best regards.
Could you please go back to "Hermit's Fountain" <cf>and check on Mr. Durga.
Just let me know that the request has been completed. <cf>Best regards.
Ze ...... ze ....... <cf>Oh, what the ....... You're back.
Looks like the "Triangle Scales of <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>" has been gathered. <cf>Thank you. I appreciate it.
Me?　I just got into Landhawk Nest <cf>and took back the weapons.
I thought it'd be a shame to let them get away with it, right? <cf>I thought I'd show you how scary the humans can be.
Did Isial say anything? <cf>What?　Kikan to tanch seitai ......?
I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure you got what you asked for at <cf>, right?　That's fine.
I'll leave the hard stuff to the pioneering bureau and you. <cf>I'm in charge of the heavy lifting.
If you need anything, just let me know. <cf>I'll help you this time.
Let's help each other out as adventurers. <cf>Well then, thank you very much!
Uh oh. ......!　I'm so screwed. ....... <cf>It's over!
Ha!　You're a ...... savior! <cf>Thank God!　God didn't abandon me!
My name is Carrion. <cf>I'm a new Bapharia guard.
There's a site near here <cf>called "Soundless City" in Bapharia. Do you know it?
There was a cave-in accident there not too long ago. <cf>Then the monsters started showing up.
Lately, there are even strange rumors at <cf>that people have seen [[Avaritia]].
Then the <cf>captain gave me a crazy order because everyone was worried about me!
[The extermination of vermin is carried out for the stability of the human mind! <cf>　Each of you, take down <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>! ["]"]
They don't want me to come home until it's over! <cf>What do you want a rookie like me to do?
Each of us has a set quota. <cf>I can't just follow my colleagues. ......
I had no choice but to ask the adventurers for help now! <cf>Please, join me in taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>!
Oh, I'll follow you just in case <cf>I don't think I'll be of any help. Sorry.
Just let them think I'm not there. <cf>At least I'm hiding so I don't drag my feet.
When you've taken down the required number, come back here. <cf>I'll report back to the captain and let you finish.
The quota the captain told me was to take down 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>in ' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>'.
I'll follow you, but I'll stay hidden and watch. <cf>When you've killed the required number, come back here.
I am so glad to have a savior like you!
Dear Captain!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>We have finished defeating the <cf>
What, are you done already? <cf>You're good. Carrion!
Mm?　Who are you? <cf>I thought I told you to take him down alone.
You don't think the Bapharia guard <cf>asked the adventurers for help, do you?
What?　Well, that ...... this is
and I am an <cf>adventurer who protected him during a defeat mission!
(Sorry!　I'd be absolutely furious if I told <cf>that I'd asked for help. Get with the story!)
It is our natural duty as <cf>guards to help those in danger!
Mm!　You know exactly what you're doing. <cf>Good. Now, on to the next assignment.
What?　You still have it?
Of course. That's not enough to make people feel safe. <cf>The next step is to take down the bandit gangs that haunt the neighborhood.
They're not like <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>They're a nasty opponent that works in tandem with the rest of us.
But, as a guard of honor in Bapharia, I will not fall behind the bandits! <cf>It is not right that he should lag behind the bandits!
Yes, it is. What about you? <cf>It's safer for you to stay here.
Hey there, adventurer!　I'm the Bapharia Guard <cf>and I'll teach you how to fight, so you can watch!
I guarantee your safety! <cf>You can count on me, hahaha!
(Let's call it that, come with me!)
Well, that's a good mindset. Carrion! <cf>Let the power of the Bapharia Guard be on full display!
You, adventurers, learn a lot. <cf>I'm counting on you!　Ha-ha-ha!
(Sorry!　Will you come with me again?)
(Next up, we're taking down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E300_01_00_01001"/> , which is hanging out at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>")
(Please!　Help me!)
Ta, Mister Captain. ...... Geez... ...... <cf>Defeat of the bandits, it is finished. ......
What?　You're back already? <cf>You're the first one back again, Carrion.
Sorry, I have to go on an urgent mission. <cf>In exchange, I will give you something good as a reward.
Read the sealed letter there. <cf>Only you have the right to read it.
You're not nay to the rest of us. ....... <cf>Okay, I'll take care of the rest. Then I'll leave the rest to you!
Oh no, you. Thank you! <cf>You kept those bandits at bay.
I'll never be able to beat those guys. <cf>Adventurers are amazing!
Oh, by the way, the captain said something about a reward. <cf>Is he talking about this sealed letter?
Only we are allowed to read it! <cf>That's kind of exciting. Let's see... ......
'To those of you who are reading this back at the beginning. <cf>　You have done well!　I give you honor.'
The next mission is yours alone. <cf>　You are the only one who can do it. <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>" immediately!
'There are very dangerous monsters in the innermost part. <cf>　This mission can only be entrusted to the best guards."
'On that note, those of us who are first back <cf>will have no problem!
'Prove your competence and show that you are <cf>proud to be a Bapharia Guard!
I cannot accompany you, but this is also my destiny. <cf>　I ask you!　You who came back first!
The reward is ...... this super tough assignment? <cf>The first one back is ...... me?
Let's pretend we didn't see ......!　Let's do that! <cf>Hey, hey!　Pretend you didn't know anything about it either......
Huh?　Carrion?
Damn, you beat me to it. <cf>You're the first one to come back!
Hmm?　What's that? Is that an order? <cf>'Duty only to the first to return.' ......?
That's great, Carrion! <cf>You're the one who got the captain's attention!
So only the first guy back gets the Accept mission? <cf>Koooooooooooooooooooo, that's cool!
Go for it! <cf>I know you can do it!
Ah ha ...... ah ha ......
Kiki, kiddo! <cf>You're coming with me, right?　Right?
Please!　Please, please, please! <cf>Please help me~!
One, the next one is ' <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>', which is ....... <cf>That means you're going to the deepest part of the page.
That's the place where <cf>there are rumors of seeing a, avaritia ......
O Savior!　Please help us~!
Well done, Carrion! <cf>You've done a wonderful job for such a newcomer!
Hmmm, hmmm... ...... I made it back safe and sound!
You are really great! <cf>I've even made it to " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"!
I did the best I could. <cf>As you can see, I didn't get hurt!
Isn't it amazing how hard we fought? <cf>I kept avoiding them all so I wouldn't get hit!
What?　You make it sound as if our adventurers <cf>were the ones in the line of fire.
No, it can't be! <cf>No way! A guard of Bapharia, no way!
Yes, that's right, Captain! <cf>Oh no, ha ha ha!
Hmmm. It's quite an achievement to return without a scratch. <cf>It looks like you can still fight to the fullest.
All right, let's get going right away! <cf>Our next opponent is an ogre. Get fired up!
Oh no. <cf>...... You're kidding, right?
I have no time for jokes. <cf>We have been looking forward to seeing a good guard like you.
Here we go!　You're the rising star of our troop! <cf>Let's see what you can do!
No, no, no, no! <cf>Hey, wait a minute!
...... Well, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>My men have taken care of you.
Yes, I have a general idea of what's going on. <cf>You saved Carrion, didn't you?
On behalf of the garrison, I thank you.
I have to train him to be a great guard. <cf>If you don't mind, I would like to ask for your help again.
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Are you thankful to the gods of Bapharia?
Huh?　I don't look like a priest? <cf>Ha ha ha!　I get that a lot.
He was born with a mouth and an attitude. <cf>I'm what you call a bad priest.
The <cf>bigwigs are giving me shit about defiling the integrity of the temple and whatnot.
Well, I don't really care! <cf>Thanks to you, I don't get any complaints about hanging around.
Do you know a priest named Panayote?
He's like a friend of the people. <cf>He often does what we ask of him.
But he's a nice guy, so <cf>I often get stuck at work.
Adventurer, you can help him if you want.
If you see a priest named Panayote, <cf>, give him a shout.
Oh, I'm Panayote. <cf>I'm a Bapharia priest.
Hmm?　What is it? <cf>Did the merchant ask you to ["]help me ["]?
Thank goodness for that! <cf>God will be pleased.
While I'm doing temple chores, <cf>I've got a few things I need to get done.
You, if you like, will you go out with me?
I get sent around a lot. <cf>I pick up trash wherever I go.
How can you be more useful to others than giving a pungent sermon?
Especially clean up the streets outside the city. <cf>Merchants, pilgrim travelers, etc., all pass through here.
But lately the number of monsters has been increasing and it's getting dangerous.
That's where you come in. <cf>I'm going to need you to escort me and, while you're at it, help me pick up trash.
Thought I'd walk <cf>between Salamzart and ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>' today.
It's almost a desert, a roadless road. <cf>But people sometimes pass through, so we can't leave it alone.
We'll find trash along the way, so let's go to <cf>and pick it up as we make our way to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"!
All I'm asking of you is...
<cf>escort between Salamzart and " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" and help pick up trash.
Let's go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" while picking up the pieces!
I found garbage right away. <cf>It's someone's leftovers. Pieces of meat, vegetable scraps.
When food scraps like this are down, <cf>monsters come to them.
Even these guys are desperate to survive. <cf>Even this garbage is a feast.
But we also want to make sure the streets are safe. <cf>That's why picking up trash is an important part of our job.
But you're supposed to clean up after yourself, right? <cf>At this rate, we're going to find more garbage.
Looks like we're still going to find trash. <cf>Let's keep going and see if we can find any other trash.
This guy is a piece of glass. <cf>It's a surprisingly messy piece of trash.
Glass reflects light and stands out. <cf>Some monsters are attracted to the light.
Not only that, it hurts when you step on it. <cf>I don't have to tell you that, do I?
How's it going over there? <cf>Oh, you're picking it up pretty well. You're good.
Well, we're almost at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"... ......?
What the heck is that? I'm a little curious. <cf>I'll go ahead and check it out.
I'm a little curious about something. <cf>I'm going to ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>' first.
Oh, hey. You're here.
I had a bad feeling about this, but I knew it. <cf>There's a big hole in the ground.
It would be troublesome if the carriage got stuck. <cf>If it's bad, people will fall off too.
There are monsters in the desert that hide in the sand. <cf>If it becomes a feeding ground for them, it's a big deal.
Garbage pickup is suspended. <cf>Let's plug the holes, even if it's just first aid.
I can do the work. <cf>You go find the "Sandstone".
It's an unusual stone that attracts sand. <cf>If you leave it there, it should fill the hole on its own.
Sandstone" can be found in the desert. <cf>Five of them should be enough. I'm counting on you, man.
Because "Sandstone" can be found at <cf> around here.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
I've been waiting for you. <cf>You brought the Sandstone.
Put this guy in the hole and fill in the surrounding area: ....... <cf>Oh, the sand is gathering right away.
Then, we reinforce it with a wooden frame and that's it. <cf>If you put a board on it, it won't fall off.
All right, that's a good first aid kit. <cf>That's a relief.
Thanks, man, that was a big help. <cf>On behalf of everyone who passes through here, I thank you.
...... Roads are great. <cf>It's what keeps people alive.
People pass through, goods pass through, and the city becomes richer. <cf>The road is silently the cornerstone of this process.
Picking up trash may be a small thing, <cf>but this is how I'm going to give thanks on the street.
Right now it's next to nothing. <cf>Eventually a city road will be built here.
Then the people who come and go here <cf>don't know shit about us.
But I'm sure what we did <cf>will help someone.
You, too, will walk down some road. <cf>When you do, think about it a little.
I'm sorry I'm being so preachy! <cf>Safe travels and good luck. See you soon!
Well, I'm in trouble. <cf>What I did with Atashi was a dumb talk.
I ordered the "Oni Dates". <cf>I usually use the ones from Evergreen.
However, the one I received was from Montenol. <cf>The grains were a little small.
This will disappoint customers. <cf>On the other hand, even if I order it, it won't arrive today.
I just need to get some Evergreen products from <cf>somehow.
Ten "Oni Nutmeyashi". <cf>Hurry up, please. I'm asking you!
The big-grained "demon date palms" can be found in the Evergreen Desert at <cf>( <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>).
I asked for the fluffiest one I could find!
Ah, the "Oni Nut Palm. <cf>Yes, it's from Evergreen.
Thanks! <cf>I like the size of these grains.
Full of sweetness and nutrients. <cf>This is the best dessert for lunch.
Now it's my turn. <cf>I'll sell as many as I can!　Come on in!
Sometimes I like to put unusual ingredients in my <cf>lunch box!
I'm sure there's some interesting stuff at <cf>like the local cuisine of the Duchy of Bernhardt.
Baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon ....... <cf>No, no, no, I'm grateful to you, Anta, okay?
A shape-shifting drug that allows you to turn into someone else. <cf>It's not easy to make such a thing.
I need a good collaborator like you. <cf>Baboon, I look forward to working with you again.
This time it's monster materials. <cf>And they're awfully hard to get.
First, there are five ' <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>chest hairs'. <cf>It has to be chest hair. Be careful.
And five " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>shank hairs". <cf>This one has to be shin hairs, right?
Why do I care about such maniacal hair? <cf>...... I don't know either!
Well, they are going to make a shape-shifting potion. <cf>The ingredients will probably be strange. Hee-hee-hee.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>should be encountered at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>The one at <cf>should be " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in Montegnor Valley
We need the hair of the people who live there. <cf>The climate and the quality of the engrams match, or something.
Ancient magic potions are wacky. <cf>Hee hee hee. Anyway, I'm counting on you.
Baboon...... transformation drug needs
Five " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>to <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>chest hairs" in " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>
Five " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>shanks" from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in Montegnor Valley.
Nice to meet you. Baboon baboon baboon ......
Baboon, good job. <cf>Looks like you got it successfully. Hee-hee.
' <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>chest hair' and <cf>' <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>shin hair'? Baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
It's hard to tell which is which. Here.
Baboon, you are giving me a hard time at all. <cf>Still, you've managed to move forward.
Thanks to you, baboon. <cf>But I still need your help.
Don't worry. <cf>I'll make sure you get your share. Hee hee hee.
Think about what you want to turn into when you're free. <cf>See you later. baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
Baboon...... needs a bit of tedious material.
We'll have to get it from the Duchy of Bernhardt, but <cf>I wonder if anyone over there has any contacts, baboon ......
Oh, you. Thanks a lot, man. <cf>I'm glad you could help.
I'm trying <cf>different ways of making the 400 year old weapon we talked about before.
Not a bad handful. But I didn't expect you to use <cf>monster material.
Now you say craft is the same thing? <cf>Yes, crafts use a variety of materials.
But the craft would only <cf>extract the engrams from the material and put them into a weapon, right?
The way I'm trying to do it is to modify the material and mix it with <cf>ore.
It takes a lot of work, but apparently doing so makes <cf>the weapon stronger.
All you need is five [shimmon iron]. <cf>And five [soft shells from <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>].
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>The shell of a goblin can be used as armor. <cf>Goblins sometimes use it as armor.
But not this time. <cf>We need the juice from boiling the soft shell.
I'm sorry I asked for the ore, too. <cf>You're welcome. I look forward to working with you.
All we need is <cf>"Deep Crested Iron" and "The Soft Shell of <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>"
Deep Crest Iron" is a mineral that can be mined at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>"
Because " <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>'s soft shell" can be taken from <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>" from <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>
I didn't realize that there's also <cf>monster material in the 400 year old weapon manufacturing process.
I know I've asked a lot of you, but I'm counting on you.
Oh, you got it. <cf>Deep Crested Iron and the Soft Shell of <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>.
Indeed, I received it. <cf>That's what I'm talking about. I'm glad I asked you to do it.
In times like this, if you can't socialize, <cf>you're screwed because you can't find a way to find a destination.
Well, let's get right to it and give it a try. <cf>I didn't think you were going to take the broth.
Surprisingly, crafting may produce <cf>interesting weapons that cannot be
I'll let you know when I do. <cf>Thanks for your help. Thank you.
400 year old weapons manufacturing methods: ....... <cf>There's still so much we don't know.
["]Steel plate with muscular suppleness ["]or ....... <cf>I know they have records, but how did they make it?
I wish I could find a sample somewhere: ......
Thanks for taking this on. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
Once again, the request is <cf>I need you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>around here.
Sometimes they get so close to the mine <cf>that the craftsmen get attacked.
My husband used to get beat up too. <cf>Well, he was young.
I went on a rampage with pickaxe in hand and <cf>chased everyone away.
Since then, our mine has taken measures to prevent <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>from coming to <cf>
If that's true, I'd love to see every last one of them <cf>gone.
And when you do that, now you have too many beasts to deal with.
So not too many, not too few. <cf>We're taking down a set number on a regular basis, and we're adjusting.
Well, it's time to get started. <cf>I'll start with 10 <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>, please.
I'll keep the list here. <cf>Come back and report back to me when you're done.
I need adventurers to <cf>take down 10 <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>around here.
Please come back and report back to me when you're done. <cf>I'm counting on you.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>The number of animals to be killed by the 10 ...... and the number of animals to be killed by the 10 ....... <cf>Okay, no problem.
Thanks a lot. <cf>Did I take rather a lot of effort?　Not really?
You have to be a local to get lost. <cf>This area is so convoluted.
Oh dear. If only my son would have stayed local. <cf>It would be a piece of cake.
I used to ask my son Einar to do it. <cf>That boy, like our man, has a strong arm.
I know the workflow <cf>and I'm used to it, so it was easy.
I should not, I should not, I should not. <cf>I hate it when I get old and bitchy.
I'm sorry. Shall we continue the debriefing? <cf>I'll ask for <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>next.
We have five kills over here. <cf>One more effort, please!
I'll ask you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>next.
We have five kills. <cf>One more effort, please!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>with five bodies ....... <cf>OK. That's the number we need for this one.
Good job!　That's what I'm talking about, adventurer. <cf>You're really good at defeating monsters, aren't you?
I'd love to have you back next time. <cf>Actually, it would be best if Einar comes back.
I wanted that kid to take over our house. <cf>It seems only my parents thought so.
'I'm going to make a living in the arts!　I want to be an actor! <cf>　And he ran away from home.
At the time, I didn't listen to him either. <cf>We had a big fight. I'm sorry about that.
If you see an actor recklessly playing against a monster, <cf>tell him to "go home once in a while."
He would at least send me a letter, but he just never <cf>comes back.
I just want to look you in the face for once and tell you to <cf>"Go for it" properly.
You're quite lucky, aren't you? <cf>You're first in line.
Don't worry. It's a surefire way to make money. <cf>I'll tell you something special just for you.
My name is Garb. I'm a peddler. <cf>I go from place to place, hawking my wares.
And. I've been going around and hearing all kinds of gossip and anecdotes and <cf>stories.
Each land has its own business. <cf>It's a first-rate merchant who makes money by finding that place.
I've heard good things about you in Litze. <cf>There's a fish for good luck.
It's called "muscle fish. <cf>Oh, you know it?
I heard you couldn't catch them until a while ago. <cf>I saw them down river the other day.
Schools of striped bass!　There were so many!
Catch 'em and sell 'em while you still can! <cf>We'll make a killing!
What?　Have you been where the musclefish are before? <cf>Wait, wait, wait!　Don't say that!
You've got to shut up and get ahead of this. <cf>Don't talk to people. Okay?
It takes two to catch them all. <cf>Come on, let's get going!
Catching musclefish downriver would be a big money-maker!
This story is a secret from the rest of us!
It takes two to catch them all. <cf>Let's hurry up and go!
Hugh!　That's a big catch! <cf>Look at that. The place is crawling with big-ass musclefish!
This is a good omen. <cf>I see. So it's a good omen.
Let's do the same and make a big profit! <cf>Let's go catch some striped bass!
Go around the river at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>'. <cf>When you have gathered enough, let's go sell them to Litze!
If you look for the river at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>' you'll find <cf>'Streak Fish'
When we get the numbers, let's go to <cf>and sell them to the residents of Litze!
Oh, it's a goldfish!　There are so many of them. <cf>Did your uncle catch these?
Hey, boy. You've got a good eye. <cf>That's right. Fresh out of the water, fresh out of the water.
Would you like one? <cf>Fish must be eaten fresh.
Huh? <cf>Uncle, are you going to eat the muscle fish?
That's right. <cf>It's a lucky charm for Litze, isn't it?
We don't eat stringray fish. <cf>If you see one, it's a good omen for a bountiful catch, so it's good luck.
The first person who sees it and tells the village about it will be <cf>thanked by everyone for being a "lucky guy."
So, your uncle is a lucky man. <cf>But what are you going to do with that pile of muscle fish?
I don't think you should eat it. <cf>Shall I bake it for you to try?
Hey, I'm getting a bad feeling about this. ...... <cf>I'm just getting a bad feeling about this. I'll take one.
Yes, sir. Then wait for me.
Here you go. <cf>I've cut them up and grilled them with salt.
Thanks. <cf>Looks like it took a long time. ......
Because it's a stringy fish. <cf>It's a lot of work just to get a knife in there.
Smells delicious. <cf>...... Well, I'll take it.
Geez!　What the hell is this?
Stones! <cf>It's stringy, the meat is tough and inedible!
I told you I don't eat them. <cf>Muscle fish are a mass of hard~ muscle all over.
I sometimes target them when I'm mountain stream fishing too. <cf>I'll let them all go when I catch them.
I can't take it home and eat it anyway. <cf>You can't even feed them to the animals.
Uncle, you've got an awful lot of stuff here <cf>but I don't think anyone's going to buy it.
Oh my god ....... <cf>I didn't know there was such a backstory.
Don't be so stingy about keeping it all to yourself <cf>I should have asked the villagers ......
Anta, how about one? <cf>...... don't need one. I can't eat it.
Damn it!　Who the hell is this? <cf>Who stocked up on such a large quantity!
......It's me!　I'll take responsibility for the food! <cf>God of Bapharia, I'll take it!
<span size="Big">It's hard! &lt;/&gt;
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>I'm looking forward to having you as my escort.
Actually, I have a girlfriend. <cf>We both like to travel, and we've been all over the place.
She's got a bad leg that's preventing her from traveling <cf>
There were still so many places <cf>that I had promised ["]let's go together["].
So I'm going to use this Imagine to bring back just the <cf>landscape.
It's just that it's an Imagine that I just got <cf>and I'm not sure yet if I can use it the way I want to.
I don't want to have to record it at the critical moment. <cf>I'd like to try it out on the local landscape first.
So. If you're going to go to all this trouble, you'll want to keep track of <cf>unusual places you don't normally see, right?
So I'm going to climb a rocky mountain. <cf>And from the top we're going to look down on the whole of Litze.
You will surely see wonderful scenery. <cf>Let's go!
First, climb the rocky hill of the "Ritze Tradeway" <cf>to get a panoramic view of Ritze.
We should be able to record some great views. <cf>Let's get going!
Oh wow!　I can see the Litze pretty well. <cf>Sexy view. I can't get enough of it!
The world is beautiful. ...... <cf>You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
I want to collect many such landscapes and present them to <cf>her!
But it's strange to look over <cf>my hometown from above like this.
When I was a kid I thought it was a big village. <cf>When you grow up you see it differently.
I've never been able to beat her in a run <cf>
...... There you go. <cf>I've got a record of what's going on in Litze.
Yup. I can look back and <cf>Imagine usage seems fine. Good.
Now we can leave in earnest. <cf>I'm planning on going to Salamzart next.
Did you know that there's a <cf>customs gate on the road to Evergreen Desert?
I wonder if I can ask you to escort me there. <cf>I'm thinking of using a riding coach beyond that point.
Just a little bit more of your company, please.
Can you please escort me to the last barrier in the "Melisos River Basin" at <cf>
We've arrived! <cf>Hmmm, I kind of feel the desert breeze.
It looks like it's almost time for the carriages to leave. <cf>There is a sturdy horse!　Let's record this too!
Hmmm, fantastic!
Oh, I guess I startled you. <cf>Sorry.
Still, it looks like the streets are even more dangerous these days than they were before <cf>
When my girlfriend and I were traveling <cf>I think there were a lot fewer monsters.
I couldn't have made it this far on my own, so thank goodness <cf>you were with me.
If I find a nice landscape in Salamzart, <cf>I may ask you to escort me again.
Oh, and I get to hear all sorts of <cf>interesting stories on my travels.
I'll be sure to let you know if there are any rumors of treasures or weird caves or <cf>anything like that.
Well then, thank you very much! <cf>God bless you on your journey as well, Bapharia!
Ha ha ha! <cf>I knew you'd show up!
The culprit always returns to the scene of the crime: ....... <cf>In other words, the culprit is you!　You are the culprit!
...... Sir. <cf>I thought this was a passing adventurer.
...... hahaha!　Surprised? <cf>It's just a little detective joke.
Dear Adventurer, I am sorry to interrupt you. <cf>Master is currently investigating a case.
The name of the case is "Serial Camel Theft! <cf>It's a mysterious case that has Salamzart abuzz!
Today, as always, a new mystery calls to me: ....... <cf>Yes, the name of this great detective Guido!
And you will now be the assistant to the great detective!
Assistant or not. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Adventurer.
My name is Cindy. <cf>My name is Cindy and I serve Master Guido.
Recently, a number of Salamzart peddler's camels <cf>have been stolen in a row.
The request was made to the master to find the culprit [--].
[--]I didn't come to you specifically. <cf>It was up to you to stick your neck out.
Hahaha! <cf>All mysteries are meant to be revealed to me!
To be frank, the husband alone is a straight shot in the <cf>labyrinth, so please stay with us!
All the crimes took place in this city. <cf>Perhaps the perpetrators are hiding nearby.
The first step is to conduct interviews, the basis of the investigation. <cf>Gather testimonies from people in town.
Take a look at the crime scene once as well. <cf>I'm sure there are clues there that your husband missed.
Cindy and I will be inquiring at another location. <cf>We will meet up later around the entrance to the city.
The basis of the investigation is interviews. And crime scene investigation.
Gather testimonies from people in this town and go to <cf>to see the back of the pioneer station where the incident took place.
We'll take another route to ask around too. <cf>We'll meet up with you around the entrance to the city later.
Hey, welcome! <cf>What's up?　You want to interview me about a case?
Ah, the camel thief. <cf>I just got one the other day.
I was caught in a huge gust of wind and a cloud of dust. <cf>When I opened my eyes, the camel was already gone.
It's funny though. <cf>How is it possible for something to disappear from your sight in an instant?
Catch the culprits as soon as possible. <cf>I can't afford a new camel with this thing.
What?　You want to hear about the case? <cf>I didn't do anything.
Oh, you mean the camel thief? <cf>There's some kind of rumor going around.
I remember hearing from someone else too. <cf>They said the killer would leave a sign at the crime scene.
Let's see, what were we leaving behind? <cf>I don't remember the details.
Anyway, it seems like there are always things left at the site. <cf>You might want to check it out.
The scene of a series of camel thefts.
A large bird feather has fallen. <cf>It could be a clue to the killer.
Let's show Guido.
Oh, I'll do it!　You're good. <cf>You think you've found a clue to the killer?
The disappearing culprit ...... will always leave a sign ....... <cf>And feathers left at the scene......
...... Hmm, I see. <cf>Looks like you have a good idea of the culprit.
Perhaps the culprit flies! <cf>Yes!　You've probably noticed.
This is the work of the legendary winged subhumans! <cf>No doubt about it!
Isn't this a feather from <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>I found it in a souvenir shop.
I don't think it's that <cf>rare in Salamzart
Hahaha! <cf>Good point, Cindy.
People in town have been talking about <cf>lately when they look at <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>a lot!
Speaking of which, it's almost egg-laying season. <cf>I'm sure you'll need to feed the chicks.
Mm-hmm. Perhaps they were catching <cf>camels as bait!
In other words, the culprit, or rather the guilty bird, is <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>! <cf>This is the truth about the serial camel thefts!
I'm having trouble with ....... How do you think we can catch the culprits <cf>?
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>to stay away from the city <cf>I suggest you put some measures in place to keep them away from the city!
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>If we can get rid of the <cf>camels, they will no longer be caught!
Hahahaha! <cf>I was just thinking the same thing!
I have one secret plan. <cf>Let's take steps to keep them away from the city.
You take down <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>and drive them away from the <cf>neighborhood.
I could go, but this is the right place for the right person. <cf>We should split our time between brain work and physical labor.
The master is not good at fighting. <cf>On the contrary, he's a bait for <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>
I'm not sure that the secret plan or whatever it is will work. <cf>Thank you, Mr. Adventurer, for your help.
Because if you knock down 10 birds, <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>will feel the danger and <cf>will stay away from them.
Adventurers, please kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"!
We will take <cf>steps to keep <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>away from the city so
Hey, welcome back. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>I see you were able to get rid of the
We just finished working on this one too. <cf>We won't let <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>anywhere near the city anymore.
Did you know? <cf>Birds don't like big eyeballs!
So we have set up a model of a floating eye near <cf>town!
I don't know if it really works, but <cf>has resulted in fewer sightings.
Thanks to all the adventurers. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>Thank you for your hard work in defeating the
What do you mean, Cindy? <cf>It's the effect of my very own floating eye model.
I hope so, sir.
Assistant. By our hand <cf>the peace of the city has been preserved.
If another incident occurs, let's <cf>work together to solve it!
Hahaha! <cf>See you then. Adios!
Thank you very much for your help, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Please accept my best regards.
We have just crossed the desert to <cf>this city ......
Along the way, we were attacked by a horde of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>and robbed of some of our <cf>merchandise!
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>has a habit of carrying away shiny objects. <cf>That's probably why they've spotted the goods
We're about to send out a search party, but <cf>they don't specialize in fighting.
So we need adventurers to drive <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>away from <cf>
If you could take down some of the <cf>search parties, it would distract them from the search parties.
We'll find their nest and <cf>take the goods back.
Best regards. <cf>Please take care.
We need adventurers to <cf>drive away <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"!
We will find the nest and retrieve the goods while we are at it. <cf>Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>Thank you for defeating them!
I have heard about your success from the search team. <cf>I heard from the search team that you did a wonderful job.
Thanks to your help we got our goods back <cf>
But ...... the gem called "Light in the Desert" <cf>has yet to be found!
That jewel is not for sale. <cf>They are heirlooms given to me by the gods of Bapharia.
'As long as there is this light, the journey through the desert will be protected. <cf>　Therefore, you must protect the light.
When it falls into the hands of the wicked, the light will be lost. <cf>　A terrible plague will be brought upon the desert.
This is what our ancestors have been telling us for generations. <cf>No matter what happens, we must bring back the "Light of the Desert"!
Reportedly, traces of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>were found in the vicinity of the <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>nest!
I'll have a search party head to <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>'s habitat <cf>immediately!
Dear Adventurer. For the second time, could you please dismiss <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>
We cannot afford to lose "Light in the Desert". <cf>Please, please, please!
We cannot afford to lose our God-given "Light in the Desert" <cf>
Can you please move <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>out of " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" to <cf>
I will recover the "Light of the Desert" in the meantime. <cf>Please, please, please!
Dear Adventurer! <cf>Thank you so, so much!
We were able to recover "Light in the Desert" safely. <cf>We owe it all to our adventurers.
Do you understand? <cf>The strong engrams in the gemstones
This is the blessing of the God of Bapharia. <cf>It is the power to guide the waters of the desert and bring them into the hands of men!
My family and I have been doing business all over the desert <cf>and strangely enough, water is the only thing we have never had a problem with!
Surely God's blessing on Bapharia <cf>has protected us on our journey!
The light was protected and disaster averted. <cf>It is only with the help of our adventurers that we were able to do this.
This, along with "Light in the Desert" <cf>we will never forget and pass it on to our descendants!
Thank you very much. <cf>May God bless you on your journey as well.
Hey, thanks for taking care of old Maja sometime ago. <cf>You came to the right place this time, too.
I'm having a huge outbreak of <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>right now. <cf>I need help reducing the number.
I'm also trying to prevent accidents. <cf>Actually, it's a bit of a personal situation.
My son, Richter, is trying <cf>a certain ritual.
It's like a test of skill, 'I'm going to finish <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>by myself' <cf>
Salamzart is now mostly merchants, but <cf>originally it was also a hunter's settlement
Bringing daily sustenance from the harsh desert <cf>environment, the hunters were respected.
Because of this tradition, <cf>even today, young people who want to become hunters are subjected to an ordeal
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>alone and <cf>have to prove themselves.
But one of them, <cf>or not, it's a burden for my son to deal with the numbers.
I can't help my son, but <cf>if left unchecked, he could be an unintended danger.
That's when I approached you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>I'm going to need fewer of these.
I'm going to hunt them down at another place. <cf>When I'm done, I'll meet you back here.
I want you to reduce the number of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>in " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"
I'm going to hunt them down at another place too. <cf>I'll meet you back here when I'm done.
Thanks for your time. Thank you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>There seems to be less and less of the
This will help you avoid unforeseen situations. <cf>Wildlife can be an unexpected hazard.
My son would have been a little easier to fight. <cf>Oh, no. I didn't mean it that way.
Hmmm, but see ....... <cf>I'm still worried.
You. I'm sorry. <cf>Can you do me one more favor?
I need you to go check on my son. <cf>I was actually going to be there myself. ......
I'm a parental idiot, myself. <cf>I might lend a hand at an important moment.
I trust you on that point. <cf>I need you to be a witness to the ritual.
My son's name is Richter. <cf>I think he's around "Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress".
...... Oh, yeah. <cf>Don't tell my son about the <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>take down.
It would be embarrassing if people thought I helped you early on. <cf>I'm sorry. Best regards. - Thank you very much.
It's a parental thing. <cf>If I were present, I might lend a hand.
I'm sorry son, but I need you to be a witness to Richter's <cf>ritual.
I think I'm around "Insect Fortress in Insect Fortress" <cf>Nice to meet you.
Hello, adventurer. <cf>Yes, I am a lictor and I'm a lictor. Rictor is me, though: ......
Huh?　My dad asked you to be a <cf>witness to a hunter's ritual?
You said you were going to witness it yourself. ...... <cf>Ah, but I guess it was just as well.
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>I've already defeated the "Mere Old Man". <cf>And to prove it, look, I got the fangs.
I just had a problem. ...... <cf>I lost the bow my dad gave me.
It was like I was so selfless in the fight. ...... <cf>I noticed it was gone.
Of course I looked for it. <cf>But I saw the shadow of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>in the distance.
If I met him unarmed, I wouldn't be able to find a bow. ...... <cf>I was just wondering what to do.
Adventurer. This is a very important bow. <cf>Can you help me with it?
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>to hunt <cf>and get rid of them from around here!
Meanwhile I'll go look for my bow. <cf>I'll join you back here later.
Can you please <cf>get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"?
In the meantime, I'll go look for my lost bow. <cf>Let me join you back here later.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Dad's bow, found it!
Thanks to Adventurer for <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>'s <cf>attention!
I ...... swore on this bow. <cf>I'm going to be a great hunter like my dad.
My dad is a worrier <cf>and he's always looking out for me, but...
I want to say to my father like that. <cf>["] How's it going?　Did you see that? ["]
I'm a full-fledged hunter myself, so <cf>you can rest assured that I'm a hunter.
But I can't believe I dropped the all-important bow. <cf>I'm not quite there yet.
I'm so embarrassed. <cf>Can you not tell my dad?
Then let's go back to Salamzart. <cf>My father will be waiting for us.
I've dropped my bow. <cf>It's a secret from my dad!
Oh, it's you. And Richter. <cf>How was the ceremony?
Dad ....... <cf>Well, what do you think?　Did you see that?
I did it! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>I was the only one who got the job done!
Here, fangs of evidence!
I had an adventurer help me with <cf>that's a whole different thing!　It's true!
Richter: ......
I see. You've done it with flying colors. <cf>Then you're a full-fledged hunter now.
...... has gotten bigger.
Children grow up before you know it, don't they? <cf>I was moved beyond recognition.
You have been a great help. I am grateful. <cf>I will never forget this debt of gratitude.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I'll train more and become a great hunter!
Now I'll be able to help someone like Mr. Adventurer <cf>
I was taken care of during the apology round sometime ago!
Isial's celebration party was ruined by <cf>my lies. ......
We had no choice, so we all decided to have a <cf>party for no particular reason.
It's made us kind of close. <cf>It wasn't all bad, was it?
No, lying is a bad thing! <cf>I'm sorry, I really am!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>You took care of me sometime.
You apologized with me and we <cf>came full circle. I'm sorry too, man.
Lying is still a bad idea! <cf>I'm going to live honestly from now on.
So. I'll be honest, <cf>I want something very badly right now!
That's the treasure called "A Testament of Courage."
A friend of mine at school was bragging about it the other day. <cf>It was an amazingly beautiful piece of the ruins!
His dad is an adventurer, <cf>and he found it somewhere.
Damn ...... I'm so jealous! <cf>I want a "Testament of Courage" too!
So help me find it. <cf>I hear it's a risky way to get a "Testament of Courage."
I was told <cf>to have an adventurer escort you if you go.
Well, I'm just a kid. <cf>If that's the way it is, so be it.
First, let's look around town. <cf>William the Butler should be there by the Pioneer Station.
They've gone ahead and done their homework. <cf>Let's go talk to them.
I want a "Testament of Courage" too! <cf>I want it so badly!
I'm doing my homework first. <cf>We'll go to William the butler.
We're near Salamzart's pioneer station.
Here I am, old man! <cf>I hired an adventurer, just like you said.
This is the little boy. <cf>We've been waiting for you.
Dear adventurer, it is nice to meet you. <cf>My name is William, your butler.
Remigio boy is <cf>the one who will eventually stand on the shoulders of his family and clan.
I hope you can experience everything and gain insight. <cf>He is also thinking about it!
We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. <cf>Please stay with us until the end!
That's about the best greeting I can give you. <cf>Grandpa. Do you have a "Testament of Courage" here?
The Pioneer Station is frequented by adventurers, travelers and others from <cf>outside
Some of you may have stopped by the ruins. <cf>They may have left clues.
Please look for it to your heart's content!
So that's how it is. <cf>That's what I'm talking about. You've done your homework perfectly.
Alright, let's find the 'proof of courage'!　Let's look for 'proof of courage'!
Why ...... why can't I find it? <cf>What do you mean, Ji?
I thought that if something had fallen through, I would have found it at ....... <cf>Looks like you weren't so naive.
Let's go to the next place. <cf>Don't worry. This experience will make you stronger.
......Mmm, you're right. <cf>Haste makes waste.
Don't be in a hurry. <cf>There's nothing brave about being found so easily.
Alright! <cf>Next stop, an oasis in the Evergreen Desert.
You go on ahead of me. <cf>I'll go with the adventurers.
Yes, sir. <cf>Good day, Mr. Adventurer. Boy. I'll see you later.
Next we're going to the <cf>oasis in "Olvid Plains".
Next time we'll find a clue to the 'proof of courage'!
We have been waiting for you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for escorting our little boy.
Boy. <cf>Oasis is another stop for many travelers!
I've heard that there is a culture of writing down stories of previous trips and <cf>advice for later visitors!
Something about "A Testament of Courage" <cf>may have left a note.
Okay, that sounds promising. <cf>Okay, I'll check it out!
This time we will find it, the "proof of courage"! <cf>Wait and see!
Adventurer!　Look at this! <cf>A note left by a traveler.
I heard that the ruins of Bapharia were found nearby. <cf>And they say that was a while ago.
There you will find "proof of courage". <cf>I'm going to the ruins of Bapharia!
Please wait, little boy. <cf>The ruins are a dangerous place, sir.
My grandpa's old body can't protect <cf>the little man.
No, I've made up my mind.
If you back down from something like this, <cf>you won't be a respectable merchant like my father!
In other words, you can't even take over the house! <cf>Isn't that right, old man?
Ummm ...... you seem to be firm in your decision. <cf>I understand.
Dear Adventurer. I have a favor to ask you. <cf>Please take us to the ruins.
We will ask you to be our official escort. <cf>No pressure, of course.
For the great growth of the little boy. <cf>Please help us!
Please take us to the <cf>site on "Old Rainfall Road"!
Oh ...... you arrived safely.
As one would expect from a first-rate adventurer, there were no such things as demons. <cf>There were no such things as demons....
No, it's really awesome. <cf>Adventurers are ......
I don't get lost <cf>and I kill monsters with ease.
I can't do anything yet. <cf>I honestly think it's awesome.
Come on, little boy. <cf>It's now or never.
Mm, yes. <cf>Let's hurry up and look for the "proof of courage"!
Hmm ......?　Oh, hey! <cf>Look at this!
I found it. A piece of your legacy! <cf>It's a "Testament of Courage."
Oh wow, it's still amazing! <cf>It's glistening in my hand!
Well done! <cf>That's what I'd expect from a little boy.
...... No. <cf>This is not something I found alone.
It's a testament to adventurers like you that <cf>fought so hard to get it.
Come to think of it, his father was an adventurer too. <cf>I'm sure he overcame difficulties.
I think I understand a little bit why this is called a 'testament to courage' <cf>
Thank you. I've taken care of a lot of things. <cf>Please accept my reward.
I pay you well for your work. <cf>That's the rule in my house.
I'm sorry for being so cocky. <cf>I'm still a novice, half a man.
If you need any more help, I'd love to help. <cf>Let me learn a lot!
Well, I'm sorry to ask you to do me such a pathetic favor.
The other day I got <cf>some weird lamps for a job I did.
According to the legend, <cf>"The White Spear that Pierces the Darkness" is hidden in it.
Sounds kind of fun, right? <cf>But I don't know how to light a fire.
We mercenaries specialize in fighting, <cf>and I'm not very good at researching things.
On that note, I figured an adventurer could <cf>do something about it.
Can I go to ...... and ask someone who seems to know more? <cf>I know, right?　That's what I thought too!
So I asked a friend of mine who is an academic <cf>and his every word was a little too complicated for me.
And when I told him that, he bent my navel.
I'm sorry, but can you go back and listen to him again? <cf>I'm sure you'll understand what he's talking about.
This is a woman named Ferena from Salamzart. <cf>She's smart, but she's not very flexible.
I'm going to ask the merchant who gave me the lamp to <cf>tell me where it came from and stuff.
So let's split up! <cf>Nice to meet you!
There's a scholar in Salamzart named Ferena.
Could you go ask <cf>about how to light an unusual lamp?
I'm sure you can understand what he's talking about.
I'm going to ask the merchant who gave me the lamp to tell me <cf>where it came from. Thanks for your help!
Oh, I'm busy. Busy. <cf>I've got to put this book together over here.
Huh?　Yes, I am. <cf>I'm Ferrena, the scholar, and I'm...
Shuget's messenger? <cf>Mwah. I already taught you about the lamp.
I went out of my way to check him out. <cf>That guy was asleep and not listening!
Do you want me to tell you again? <cf>...... Well, I don't mind if you do.
In return, please help me do my job.
Even research isn't free. <cf>I'd like to get a little something in return too!
Actually, some of my collection was damaged by sand and I decided to move it to <cf>Asterleeds!
It's quite a lot, so <cf>I was going to use a carriage ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>has made so many holes in the road <cf>that the carriage can't drive on the road as it is.
I was waiting for the Pioneer Bureau to respond. <cf>Just in time!
Adventurers can beat about <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, right? <cf>Get rid of them from near the street.
I will then tell you about the lamp. <cf>I'll ask you to do so, as a condition of the exchange.
Get rid of the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>herd at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>'!
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>You have defeated the
Thank you very much. <cf>And sorry for being so rude!
It's Suzette who is at fault, isn't it? <cf>You had nothing to do with it.
I regret that I was unreasonable in my request. <cf>I am truly sorry for my arrogance and ...... manner of speaking!
Um, I apologize for the apology, but <cf>I've been scouring the literature as much as I can find!
It looks like you need <cf>"Engram's Multiple Crystals" to turn on the lamp that Suzette has!
Around here, it looks like ....... <cf>It should be found near "Whispering Cliffs."
I'm just a little concerned that it said 'for festivals' <cf>
The "White Spear that Pierce the Darkness" is <cf>an exaggeration for a festival, don't you think?
I don't think anything bad will happen to you, but <cf>in the meantime, be careful!
Well, I'll be off then. <cf>Please give my best wishes to Suzette.
[Next time something troublesome happens, I'll definitely ask you to do it at <cf>.
Around here, you can find it at <cf>near "Whispering Cliffs"!
Please give my best wishes to Suzette. <cf>["]I'll have you take care of the next nuisance ["]and
Hey, good job! <cf>Did you hear from Ferrena?
Did you get rid of ...... <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>Ha ha!　That was a disaster.
I'll be sure to thank Ferrena for that. <cf>She's got a lot to say, doesn't she?
What, you're still pretty mad at ......? <cf>Oh, yeah. Well, I'm sorry about that.
So, you've heard about the new literature. <cf>...... "Multiple Crystals of Engram" and hey for the festival!
I asked the merchant about it <cf>and he said the lamps flowed from Asterleeds.
They've got one for the divas <cf>They said it's Bapharia's legacy.
Songs and festivals or ....... <cf>Sounds like a fun tool!
Hahaha, I'm starting to look forward to it! <cf>Now that we're here, let's turn on the lamp together. Let's turn on the lamp together!
It was the "Whispering Cliffs" that had the multiple crystals, right? <cf>Okay, let's look for them!　Let's look for them!
I thought the "Whispering Cliffs" in <cf>"Olvid Plains" was where the "Multiple Crystals of Engram" were located.
Let's gather up quickly and light the lamp together!
Oh, there it is. <cf>This is the "Engram's Multiple Crystals.
Let's get it in the lamp right away.
Come on, "The White Spear that Pierces the Darkness"! <cf>Show us what it is!
Wow!　It's dazzling!
Wow ....... <cf>That was amazing. My eyes still flicker.
It's not exactly eye-glazing ......, is it? <cf>It wasn't just the brightness of the lamp, man.
Ahh ...... I see. <cf>I'll just light up the sky.
Look. <cf>The light stretches straight up to the sky.
I can see clearly at night when it's this bright. <cf>I see. So it's the "white spear that pierces the darkness.
I've seen something similar at the Star Festival before, man. <cf>I saw a light like this shining on a diva in Bapharia.
There were a few more lights then, though. <cf>It was sparkly and beautiful. ......
Hehe. I got a nice inheritance. <cf>I'll brag about it to Ferrena.
It was fun!　Thanks for hanging out with me, man. <cf>I'll see you again when I get a chance!
Odd that we meet in Salamzart as well. <cf>No, I don't have to tell everyone.
We are both seekers of the secrets of [raija]. <cf>It's only natural that we find ourselves in the same place.
You must have also seen the clues here at <cf>, didn't you?　Good instinct!
The ancient coin you requested this time. <cf>Actually, the same one is kept at the Order.
It used to be something that could be seen at any time. <cf>However, this was not the case with the status of a third-class priest.
Not at all ...... you stone-headed priests. <cf>Trying to cover up the truth won't work!
...... Oops, excuse me. <cf>Anyway, I need the actual coin.
It appears to be in the ruins of Bapharia in "Olvid Plains." <cf>Other adventurers may be looking for it.
It would be good to hear what they have to say. <cf>Well, I look forward to working with you.
Ancient coins are said to be found at the <cf>Bapharia site in the "Olvid Plains"!
Talk to some of the adventurers there <cf>and see what you can find out!
Huh. <cf>Have you come looking for ancient coins too?
Hmph. <cf>I'm Aaron, an adventurer. Nice to meet you.
I found a coin too. <cf>It's a ...... beautiful coin that shines in rainbow colors when you hold it up.
Brilliance is ephemeral. <cf>Ancient brilliance that is lost is still more ephemeral
Huh ....... <cf>Sounds just like me, doesn't it?
...... I've got a question for you. <cf>Will you listen to me?
There's a <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>going haywire nearby. <cf>If left alone, it will damage the ruins.
So we're going to take them down as soon as possible. <cf>The request was made to the Bureau of Reclamation.
Huh ....... <cf>Looks like it was too much for me.
So I would like to ask you to take them down instead. <cf>Of course, I'll pay you.
That's right. I'll give you some of the coins I've collected. <cf>You can use it for something.
If you successfully defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>, come back here <cf>
I'll stay here and heal a little longer.
Huh ....... <cf>What a fragile adventurer, I am.
Huh ....... Go take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>for me.
Come back here when you have finished successfully. <cf>I will give you my collection of ancient coins.
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>I see that you have finished defeating the "Mere Old Man". <cf>Thank you. Nice work.
Hmph. <cf>Your success is now etched in my mind as a heroic tale.
It's the ancient coin I promised you. <cf>Hold it up for me to try.
See, it glows in rainbow colors. <cf>Even in the dark, it glows by itself when you hold it up.
We don't know how it works. <cf>But that's a minor detail.
The beauty of coins remains the same. <cf>And the fragility of leaving the ancient splendor behind in secret.
Hu ....... <cf>It's one of those romantic things, you know?
Well, I'm well rested. <cf>I'm going back to town.
Take care of yourself and go home. <cf>See you soon.
Hoo ....... The coin I gave you is <cf>You can do what you want with it.
Oh, you're going back to Salamzart, too. <cf>You're going to deliver the coins to a priest named Walken.
Oh, it is indeed the coin I was asking for! <cf>Thank you very much!
No, I miss it. <cf>I can feel my heart stirring.
When I was a kid, my parents showed me this coin <cf>
That's what got me interested in <cf>various histories!
My starting point, so to speak. <cf>I wanted to keep it on hand if I could.
This coin appears to be a relic of a different civilization than the Bapharia civilization <cf>
It has nothing in common with Luno coins either. <cf>Hmmm, once again, it's a strange thing to see.
I thought the rainbow-colored glow was to keep people from making fakes. <cf>With today's technology, it is impossible to make something identical to this.
Have you noticed ......? <cf>Yes. Why would such a coin be found in an archaeological site?
The key is [raija]! <cf>There is no doubt about it!
Different worlds, or different times! <cf>If it belongs to a visitor from there, ......
It makes sense that coins from different civilizations would be <cf>found in the ruins of Bapharia!
Ancient coins brought by the visitors! <cf>It may be a reference to the god of Bapharia!
A single coin can lead us into the mysteries of a magnificent world yet to be discovered. <cf>
What do you think! <cf>Don't you feel the romance!
...... style. Nope, my apologies. <cf>I'm getting hot again.
I have seen the coin and renewed my mind. <cf>I will surely get to the truth of history!
You and I have a connection. <cf>So, let's discuss again somewhere else.
Welcome, adventurer! <cf>Our vegetables are very tasty!
I mean, no, no, no! <cf>I don't want you to buy vegetables!
I'm trying to get <cf>Bapharia's heritage to sell more vegetables!
I have a dairy farmer in Minsterhorn, <cf>Mr. Reuben has it.
I don't know how it works, but <cf>they can make things cold!
Tomatoes and such taste good when chilled, don't they? <cf>Especially in Salamzart, because it's so hot.
I think if you put cold veggies on the table <cf>people would jump on it!
I wonder if they would be willing to give it to us somehow. <cf>Or even just lend it to me for a bit!
Adventurer, could you ask him once? <cf>Best regards!
I want a Bapharia heritage that makes things cold.
I have a dairy farmer in Minsterhorn, <cf>Mr. Reuben has it.
Could you ask him if he'd be willing to give it to me? <cf>Best regards!
Are you the one that Kurt's little boy sent to run errands for?
It's Bapharia's heritage that makes things cold. <cf>I certainly have it.
Here it is. <cf>A water bottle made of steel, I guess.
Anything you put in this thing will be as cold as <cf>ice in no time!
That way they can transport the milk fresh from the farm <cf>
But it's smaller than I thought it would be. <cf>It only holds about a cup or two.
This is not good for our business. <cf>It's fine for my own use.
Kurt-boy wants it? <cf>Yes, he does. We've been so good to your parents.
It would be better to use it well and get <cf>than to leave it at home!
If you want to give it up, that's fine. <cf>But before you do, would you do me a favor?
This morning, <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>was after my cow. <cf>I managed to get rid of him.
Apparently there's a <cf>herd that's territorial around here.
I would hate to see it happen again. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Can you please get rid of them?
I will give you that reward and a set of inheritance. <cf>Best regards.
They're after the cows <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>and I want <cf>to take them down and get rid of them.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>You've driven away the herd of <cf> That's quite a feat.
Thank you. <cf>And now, then, the legacy of Bapharia, as promised.
I hope it helps Kurt-boy. <cf>Go ahead, deliver him.
I hope it helps Kurt-boy. <cf>Now go on and deliver that legacy.
Kurt boy is in Salamzart.
Wow!　It's Bapharia's legacy! <cf>They really gave it away!
What did you say to him and ask him to do it? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Avenge the death?　Wow!
Thanks to you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>This is the legacy that makes things cold, huh?
Yes, it's smaller than I thought. <cf>I don't know if I could put vegetables in it as it is.
...... No, but cut up fruit would work! <cf>Yeah, that's a great idea!
To the merchant or traveler who has traveled through the desert <cf>cold, sweet fruit!　Good, good, good!
Thanks! <cf>Now you'll get some new customers.
I'll always sell cold, <cf>delicious fruit to adventurers, too!
I see that you are looking for Ellie. <cf>Thank you. I couldn't find her anywhere.
I was showing my kids a puppet show <cf>and before I knew it, they'd disappeared.
Ellie has the appearance of a graceful cat. <cf>She's my beloved friend.
It's not just a doll of my own making. <cf>I was worried that they might be scary. ......
Ring a bell?　...... Yes, I do. <cf>Maybe the kids know something.
Ellie disappeared during the puppet show <cf>so there should be at least one witness.
Let's split up and talk to them. <cf>Let me know what you find out.
Ellie has the look of a gracious cat.
I was showing my kids a puppet show and <cf>disappeared before I knew it.
Let's split up and talk to the villagers. <cf>If you learn anything, let me know.
Oh, what am I going to do? The cat is at ....... <cf>What should I do? ......
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
Looking for a white cat doll. ......ッ
Wow, I know!　I saw it!
It was when Paolo was doing a puppet show. <cf>There was a cat doll that fell at the entrance of the village.
I had to pick it up and deliver it, and then <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>came running.
When I grabbed the cat and put it in my mouth, <cf>it just ran away. ......
It's too dangerous to chase them out of the village and ...... <cf>Mr. Paolo's play is still going on. ......
I, I don't know what to do. <cf>I'm sorry!
Tell your cat about <cf>Paolo.
The cat was also saying ["]help me ["]! <cf>I heard it so clearly.
...... What? <cf>You mean that the cat can talk even though it is a doll?
Indeed it is. ...... Huh? <cf>Then what the hell is that voice ......?
The cat doll, <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>, ran away with <cf>, including its mouth. ......
Please share this with Mr. Paolo.
Did any of the kids see Ellie? <cf>Good!　I think I found a clue.
So, what did the kid say?
...... <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>to <cf>Ellie was kidnapped!
Oh my god!　Ellie is a doll. <cf>She's not built that sturdy.
If a monster bites you or something <cf>it will break easily!
Please. <cf>Can you hurry up and get Ellie back?
I'll be sure to thank the girl who told me at <cf>
I feel sorry for him if you let it bother you too much. <cf>There is nothing wrong with that kid.
You are my only hope. <cf>Please help Ellie.
I need you to reassure me and the girls. <cf>Please, please, please!
You can help Ellie who has been kidnapped by defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>around here <cf>!
Please, please, please!
This cat doll is ...... elly! <cf>I'm glad you rescued her!
Thank you so much! <cf>I can't thank you enough.
But it's scratched all over the place. ...... <cf>Ellie, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for you.
I'll fix it right away. <cf>Sorry. I just need a little more help.
Ellie's body is made of a special material. <cf>As long as we have it, we can fix it right up.
I need you to go to <cf>and find the "central circuit of <value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>".
It should be dropped by <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>, which is encountered at " <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>"
I promised that girl that I would show her a healthy Ellie <cf>too!
Because as a puppeteer, I can't let my children <cf>be sad.
I'll be ready to fix Ellie. <cf>I asked for a copy of "The Central Circuit of <value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>."
I need to repair Ellie now. <cf>Ellie's body is made of a special material.
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>" and look for <cf>"The central circuit of <value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>"
<value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>You should be able to get <cf>if you beat the
I'll be ready to fix Ellie. <cf>I just need a little more help.
It's "The Central Circuit of <value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>". <cf>Thanks!
Now I can fix Ellie up.
Do this, do that...... <cf>if you embed this here......
...... Okay! <cf>How's that working out for you, Ellie?
Thank you, Meow.
Oh, thank God! <cf>You look like you're feeling better.
Hmm?　What's the matter? <cf>You look surprised.
Oh, I guess I didn't tell you. <cf>Ellie is an autonomous doll.
With the technology of Bapharia's heritage, <cf>they can move and talk on their own.
I've been working on an autonomous doll for a while. <cf>Ellie is the first prototype.
I must have walked around during the puppet show. <cf>She's a total pain in the ass.
I'm sorry, meow.
You ask if you can have a free conversation with them? <cf>That's a secret. I'll leave it to your imagination.
Now, let's resume the puppet show. <cf>We need to get the kids to smile.
Thank you for everything. <cf>You've been a great help to us. You really helped us.
'Oh ....... <cf>I wonder where that man is now. ......'
...... Oh, sorry, sorry. <cf>I was just working on a role for my next play.
This one's a love romance. <cf>Now that's a line.
I've been working on the role alone up to this point <cf>and it's not going well.
I was thinking I'd like someone to play opposite me and <cf>found someone who fits the image perfectly!
I just passed by that road there <cf>It's an adventurous woman.
He was walking so dashingly, with his chest out proudly <cf>I couldn't help but admire him.
I bet she is very confident in herself. <cf>She's perfect for our heroine this time.
But while I was gawking at him, he went away <cf>and I never found out who he was or where he was.
I would love to have that person as my partner! <cf>Could you please go find her for me?
I walked towards the Pioneer Station, so <cf>if you see anyone who looks like that, please give me a shout.
To complete my role, <cf>I would like to ask that adventurer to play opposite me!
As you walked toward the Pioneer Station, <cf>could you please talk to the lady who looks like that?
Hmm?　You wanted to see me?
...... Hmmm. I was walking around town <cf>looking for a young female adventurer?
Oh. As you can see, I'm an adventurer. <cf>I was just out for a walk.
I don't know if I can be of any help.
...... What?　I'm the actor's partner! <cf>Wait, wait, wait. That's some kind of mistake!
It sounds like a bad joke to me that someone as rough as me is playing the heroine <cf>!
Well, I'm pretty confident in my skills. <cf>I don't want to be taken advantage of just because I'm a woman.
But I can't believe you're an actor. ...... <cf>And a love romance?　More and more unlikely!
Mr. Einar, right? <cf>Can you take me to see the actor who requested this?
I think you're looking at it wrong. <cf>But, well, you seem to be in trouble.
If you've got the wrong guy, you've got the wrong guy, <cf>because you might remember something else.
I don't think <cf>you're looking at the wrong person to be playing a heroine as rough and tumble as I am.
You brought me here!　Thank you!
Are you Einar? <cf>I heard you were looking for a rehearsal partner.
Yes, it is! <cf>But ...... that?
She looks like a woman I've seen, but there's something about her: ......
Something different, I guess. <cf>I guess I'm not the one you're looking for.
Oh, thank God! <cf>You can't play opposite someone in a love romance.
Sorry for the disturbance! <cf>And I'm kind of rude ......
Oh, that's okay. I don't mind. <cf>I have an idea who you're looking for.
You know, the spiffy, cool, female adventurer? <cf>Maybe he meant Tsurka.
We have totally different atmospheres, but our physiques are similar to mine. <cf>And we're the same age.
He's got skill, and he's got class. <cf>He could pass for an actor.
Tsurka or ....... <cf>Sorry. Can you please bring that person to me.
I think Tulka would be at the <cf>camp on "Old Rainfall Road". Look for him.
I'm sorry. <cf>I think I may have seen that Mr. Tsurka.
They are at the "Old Rainfall Road" camp. <cf>Can you bring him to me?
I am Tsurka, though. <cf>What?　You want me to play a role partner?
That would be an honor. <cf>I'd love to say that. ......
I'm Accepting another request right now. <cf>Sorry, but I'd like to finish this one first.
I've been asked to deliver "Thirsty Roses" that bloom around here to <cf>
It's a pretty hardy plant, and Salamzart makes use of it as a <cf>monster repellent net!
If you don't mind, could you help me? <cf>In return, I'll do what you ask.
Of course, we don't say work for free. <cf>We'll pay you part of your fee.
I'm going to make it easy for you. It's only natural. <cf>Well, let's get this over with quickly.
Ten "Thirsty Roses". <cf>Let's meet up here after we collect them.
I'd like to take on a role partner, but I'd like to <cf>finish the request I'm currently taking on.
Could you please collect the <cf>"Thirsty Roses" that bloom in " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"?
We'll meet back here when we're done.
You've collected the "Thirsty Roses". <cf>That's a big help. Thank you.
Thanks to you, it went off without a hitch. <cf>That concludes my request.
Your next request. <cf>As promised, I'll take the other side.
That was Mr. Einar, wasn't it? <cf>Take me to that actor.
As promised, I'll take the other side.
Einar, the actor, is in Salamzart, right? <cf>Show me around as soon as possible.
Are you ...... Tsurka if you are?
Yes, I was. I was nominated to be the partner for the training. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
Oh, that storytelling ...... standing ......!
You're the one I've been looking for! <cf>I knew I had the right image!
Please, could you <cf>be my training partner?
No acting or dialogue required. Just stand there <cf>and let my imagination run wild!
Is that all you got?　Okay, I got it.
Yes, beautiful posture. <cf>I can picture the scene in my mind more and more.
...... Okay, let's get started.
'--Oh, my beautiful flower! <cf>Before your beauty, even the stars lose their luster!"
'The civilization you say once flourished <cf>will perish before you.'
You are so dazzling that you are beyond the reach of many lights! <cf>"So dazzling is your form that it defies all light!"
...... What can I say? <cf>Well, it's more embarrassing than you can imagine.
I've never experienced such hot words from <cf>before.
No, it's just not in your face. ...... <cf>Deep down inside, I just want to run away.
Just standing still, etc., is outrageous. <cf>I'm much more comfortable dealing with monsters.
Actors, in some ways, may be <cf>far more courageous than adventurers!
Yeah, it's great! <cf>I feel like I'm ready for a role I've never played before.
All thanks to you. Thank you. <cf>I think I've come a long way as an actor.
That's the best I can do. <cf>I will now go to ......
No, no!　Mr. Tsurka still has <cf>to keep me company.
There are plenty of lines. <cf>Let's get on with it!
'Oh!　You are more <cf>fresh than a desert oasis ......!"
Gosh ......! <cf>It's going to go on like this from start to finish: ......
I got a letter from my uncle Bros. <cf>He's in trouble and wants me to send someone over.
Adventurer. Sorry, but <cf>could you go check on Bross for me?
Huh?　That's not enough to tell? <cf>No, no, no, I think you can tell at a glance.
Near the camp in Shimmering Valley, <cf>there's an oddball digging a hole in the desert because he's a bros.
The reason I'm digging a hole? <cf>Hmmm... ...... can you please stop laughing and listen?
...... treasure hunt
Haha, it's okay. <cf>I think it's a stupid story too.
In fact, I've been laughed at so many times. <cf>My relatives won't even touch the bros' story.
But Bross never stops saying there is a treasure. <cf>[There's a treasure in Meldrethright! ["]"] he said.
You can ask Bross himself about the rest. <cf>He knows a lot more than I do.
Oh, yes. Deliver these. <cf>Food and water. And some medicine. I've wrapped up the bare necessities.
Bross is stubborn and blunt, but <cf>not a bad guy. Sorry. Please don't hate him.
I need you to go check on the bros. <cf>Also, I need you to deliver water, food, and a set of meds.
Near the camp in "Shimmering Valley" <cf>there's an oddball who goes out of his way to dig a hole in the desert.
That's the guy who's bros. I don't know what he's doing. <cf>Nice to meet you.
What the hell, man? <cf>You're wasting your time talking to me.
...... adventurer?　Did Terre tell you to come here? <cf>Oh yeah. I'm sorry about that. Sorry about that.
You're bothering Terua, too. <cf>She's the only one who cares about me.
I'm digging a hole here. <cf>Because down here is the treasure my ancestors left me.
...... Yes, that's right. You see. <cf>There is no country, no city, no nothing here. Not now.
But there once was. <cf>A metropolis that was no less developed than Khartoum.
The name of the country is Meldreth. <cf>Apparently my ancestors were Meldrethite royalty.
But when the desertification of this area progressed <cf>it sank to the bottom of the sand along with Khartoum.
That was hundreds of years ago. <cf>Now the family is just an ordinary citizen.
So, I can't deny it even if they say it's just a tall tale. <cf>Except to actually dig.
I know they think I'm stupid. <cf>I know I'm shunned by my relatives.
But I have to dig a hole here. <cf>Even if there is no treasure!
Sorry ....... I got a little heated.
Anyway, I never stop digging. <cf>I still need help sometimes, though.
Thanks for coming all the way out here. <cf>Right off the bat, can you do me a favor?
Dumbly, I injured my hand digging. <cf>There are supposed to be medicinal herbs nearby.
What?　You have the wound medicine that Terua gave you? <cf>...... that guy. He should have just left it alone.
I'll be grateful for it. <cf>But I want to stock up just in case.
Go look for 'lizardbush weed'. <cf>It makes a good remedy for bruises and sunburn.
Sorry for the hassle. <cf>I'm looking forward to working with you.
Go look for <cf>"lizardbush grass" that grows in " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>" for stockpiling wound medicine.
It's a good remedy for bruises and sunburn.
Oh, good job. <cf>Looks like the "lizardbush weed" has gathered.
Thanks for your help. <cf>I have to thank Terua again.
I hope this ridiculous hole digging is a little <cf>better for that kid.
[--]When this land became thin and deserted <cf>the inhabitants of Meldreit moved to Salamzart.
It's a big move for one country. It costs a lot of money. <cf>At that time, my ancestors gave up their personal wealth.
I'm prepared to lose my royal status and authority.
I loved this story. Even though I'm just a citizen now <cf>my family saved a lot of people.
But if the treasures left by our ancestors were buried <cf>it would be a whole different story. Understand?
My ancestors pretended that they were throwing away their wealth. <cf>That's how they kept deceiving people with a beautiful story that never happened.
That's why there shouldn't be any treasure left. <cf>My ancestors lost everything, but they saved the people of the desert!
So I dig. <cf>To prove that there is no treasure, and to protect the family's honor.
It's a small thing to be proud of, but <cf>I want it to be a real beautiful story that Terua and her descendants can pass down to the next generation.
I feel better after talking to you. <cf>I think I'll take a little break.
Maybe there is something in <cf>you that can open the mind of such an eccentric. Thank you.
My house is being remodeled right now. <cf>I'm thinking of taking this opportunity to furnish it with new furniture.
Especially the headboard, it's getting old. <cf>I commissioned a highly respected sculptor from Asterleeds to do it.
You know, the ones that make you feel wild!
His name is Mr. Aurelie, <cf>and he's known as a terrific guy in that field.
However, I haven't heard from them even after the due date. <cf>I am looking forward to it.
So. I need you to go to Mr. Aurelie's home and pick up the <cf>headboard.
If you haven't completed it yet, go to <cf>and ask me for the next due date and I'll be fine.
There are a lot of things about being an artist. <cf>Some delays are to be expected.
But you're in trouble if you come home late. <cf>Make it quick and come back.
Well then, nice to meet you. Wahaha!
Go to the home of Asterleeds' acclaimed sculptor, <cf>Mr. Aurelie.
I'd like to see you pick up a headboard from <cf>that will make me feel wild.
Oh, honey. You wanted to see Mr. Aurelie? <cf>If it's that freak, he's not home.
It's saved me from having to listen to strange noises in the middle of the night. <cf>
Every night ["]wild, eend, dynamic! <cf>Hyo-oh-oh-oh! ["]], and it's loud.
My mimicry is quite similar to yours.
Yes, yes, and so on. <cf>To top it all off, he came to our house this morning.
[I just don't get it! <cf>　What is wild? ["]"] you ask.
It was a pain in the ass, so I said <cf>["]You should check out the amazing auger ["]and you'll see what I'm talking about.
He just ran off with his eyes wide open. <cf>I don't think he's been back since.
Do you have any idea where he's going? <cf>Well, I'm thinking " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>".
My husband is an adventurer and he told me that there is an amazing ogre named <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/> at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>.
I remembered that and told Aurélie. <cf>Did I say something funny?
I wonder if it was a bad idea to tell Aurelie about " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" <cf>
You know, I used to [look up ["]cuteness["] and go to <cf>Uribo's and go to ......
You came home in tatters. <cf>I remember that time, too, when you knocked me up in the wee hours of the morning.
It looks like " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" will be on " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>". <cf>If you really went to see them, I think you'll find them there.
The battle of " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" is ...... <span size="Big">woohoo, great! &lt;/&gt;
This primal breath of life! <cf>Yes!　This is what I've been looking for, yes [--]
<span size="Big">Dynamic Inspiration! &lt;/&gt;
I'm so sorry, ma'am! <cf>Now my masterpiece is about to be born!
...... hmm?　What's up, dude? <cf>Don't just stand there, you've got to fight.
A battle for the souls of adventurers and " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" to cut down their lives! <cf>Therein lies the true wild I seek!
If it's me, don't worry about it! <cf>If you keep yelling, somehow ' <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>' won't come near you!
You want to talk to me about something, don't you?　But I hate to say it! <cf>My mind is on you and the battle of <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>right now!
Until I get this wild fight off my chest <cf>my ears will not hear any story!
That's why. <cf>Go ahead, do it. Go ahead, do it.
My mind is now on you and the battle of " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>"!
Don't just stand there, fight <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" properly!
Oh, man, that was great! <cf>It was wild and unbelievable!
Even " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" who lost to you, <cf>, had a fresh look on his face!
And your fight produced my masterpiece! <cf>Now, let me show you!　I'm gonna carve it!
What, you don't see it! <cf>Then what are you doing here!
...... Mr. Manfredo's headboard? <cf>What the heck. That monstrosity is long overdue.
A goblin warlord killing a boar! <cf>That's another wild masterpiece!
But thanks to making that guy, I started worrying about <cf>["]What is Wild? [I started worrying about it.
Well, I'm going to continue working on it a little longer! <cf>What?　Do I have to go home?
...... need me to give you the headboard? <cf>Oh, yeah, right. Oh well, I'm going home!
I'd like to keep working on it, but <cf>can't help it!　I'll give you the headboard.
I'm going back to Asterleeds!
<span size="Big">It was a dynamic trip! &lt;/&gt;
There you go. This is the headboard I ordered. <cf>Now I have to make the next one!
It's simmering! <cf>Dynamic and wild visions of battle!
The battle between you and " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" was awesome! <cf>Thank you!
Let's do it, let's do it, I'm gonna do it! <cf>I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve!
Well, the fight between you and " <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" <cf>was really hot!
Take the <cf>headboard to Mr. Manfredo in Salamzart.
I've got to work on my next one!
Oh, Mr. Aurelie's headboard! <cf>You've completed it.
Hoho ....... <cf>Hmmm, this is wild and wonderful again!
I don't know what it is, but <cf>I can feel the heat and wildness anyway!
If you sleep with this under your pillow <cf>you are sure to wake up wild!
You are someone who understands the value of art. <cf>You carry it with care and not a scratch on it.
Mmmmmm, thank you!　I'm very satisfied. <cf>If you ever need anything else, please let me know.
Hmmm... ....... You seem to have a good nose too. <cf>Pretty good call on choosing me.
Once again, my name is Cattleya. <cf>I'm a trader. Nice to meet you.
This time, I'm looking for "Kartoum's Fang Work". <cf>It's an artifact made by decorating the fangs of a monster.
It is said to have once flourished in the ancient desert city of Khartoum <cf>
The process and technology is now lost, but <cf>that's why it's so popular with the cognoscenti.
I want to bring this tuskwork back to life in the modern age.
Because it smells like money! <cf>You're definitely going to make a lot of money!
Having said that, I don't believe you can do it alone. <cf>You want a good business partner.
I heard about your reputation at the pioneer station. <cf>I hear you're a pretty good adventurer.
I need you to gather the fangs for the materials. <cf>I'll take care of the negotiations.
You need someone to do the carving for the tusk work, right? <cf>We have good people in Asterleeds.
Sculptor Aurelie. Mr. Manfredo, a wealthy man, even ordered one from <cf>, so he's good.
I'm going to go talk to him and see if he's willing to Accept this job. <cf>You collect the "True Circle Fangs of <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>" and
Let's meet at Aurelie's house. <cf>I'm counting on you then. Nice to meet you.
I need you to collect the <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>to <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>round fangs" that are in " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>"
I'm going to go ahead and negotiate with <cf>Aurelie in Asterleeds.
When you're done collecting, meet me at Aurelie's house at <cf>
I see you got "The True Circle Fang of <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>". <cf>Thanks. I was just talking to Aurelie too.
Oh, oh, oh, oh! <cf>I'd be happy to take on any interesting job!
I'm trying to resurrect <cf>"Kartoum's Fangwork" using this " <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>'s True Circle Fangs".
I'll get you the real one, and you can use it as a reference <cf>to carve these tusks for me.
O....... <cf>Tension Down.
I'm not into this. ...... <cf>Sorry, you'll have to find someone else.
That's not how it works. <cf>What's not to like?
If it's a reward, I'm up for it. <cf>We need your skills!
That's not the point. <cf>You can't express my soul with these puny fangs.
Ah mei jin!　But no. <cf>Exciting!　But no. Go home.
I wonder if there is anything shabby about fangs ......? <cf>I don't know what artists think.
But I'm not the one to give up here.
If this happens, let's make that man shake his head <cf>at will!
I'm going to hunt for the fangs of the phantom serpent <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/>" in "Hollowed Tempest"!
If it's his fangs, <cf>they won't say it's a showstopper.
It's okay. You can do it! <cf>I mean, who else but you could do it?
So, yes. Have a good day! <cf>Good luck!
I'm going to hunt for the fangs of <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/>" in the Evergreen Desert's "Hollowed Tempest"!
It's a job only you can do! <cf>I hope you come home safe and sound.
Oh, it's you guys again. <cf>I'm not interested in talking about fang work.
Hmph. Is it okay? <cf>I wonder if I can still talk big when I see these fangs.
Burn it into your eyes! <cf>Burn the fangs of the legendary " <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/>"!
Oh, wow!　 <span size="Big">What the heck! &lt;/&gt;
I didn't know such a big fang existed!　It's amazing! <cf>Just looking at them, I get inspired to create!
Oh-ho-ho!　What do you say? <cf>If you work with me, you can do whatever you want with these fangs, okay?
Seriously!　I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it! <cf>I'll do it!
Well, then, you'll take care of it, won't you?
Of course! <cf>Who else but me could do such a big job?
Let's get to work right away! <cf>Let's carve, carve, carve!
Well, we have a deal. <cf>That's the fang of the legendary serpent.
I owe it all to you for getting it for me. <cf>You are indeed the partner I've been looking for.
Oh, yeah. <cf>Speaking of legends, you know what?
I'm told there's a ridiculously strong <cf>kagachi damselfly lurking in Montegnor Valley.
They call it " <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>" or something like that. <cf>Anyway, I heard it's just really bad.
If I see the fangs of a guy like that <cf>my creative juices will explode. ......
Hun ...... don't have to tell everyone. <cf>It's my job to keep the field motivated.
Fair enough! <cf>I'll get you the " <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>" fangs!
Ma-ji-ka-yo! <cf>Oh, oh, oh!　It's a good thing I took on this job!
It burns!　It roars!　It's boiling! <cf>Nothing can stop my hands now!
[--]Well, you're up for it. <cf>[--] Well, you're up.
No, because. It's <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>. <cf>What else is there to do but you?
I can't let Aurelie discourage me. <cf>Please!　You're all I have!
Get the fangs of <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"!
Please!　You're all I have!
Welcome back. Have you really ...... taken down <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>"?
Hey, that's great! <cf>That's great news in itself!
Oh, man!　Amazing!　This is amazing! <cf>The best fangs in the world!
I can see it!　I can see the battle to the death between " <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/>" and " <cf>" and " <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>"!
Enemies who should never have collided! <cf>But through you these guys have met!
This is truly a clash of legends and legends!
<span size="Big">Ahmeijin k eksaitin! &lt;/&gt;
Carve, carve, carve, carve, carve, carve, carve <cf>All thanks to you, man!
I am utterly amazed. Your workmanship. <cf>You have exceeded my expectations!
But as for "Kartoum's Fangwork" <cf>it's not going to be easy to bring it back to life!
Legendary monster fangs are not something you can get <cf>easily, right?
That said, Aurelie is not going to work if you bring her normal monster <cf>fangs and ......
The sculpture itself will sell for a good price, but <cf>it won't be an ongoing business.
Well, I got to know you <cf>and that alone was a huge benefit.
Glad you found a great business partner.
If I come up with another new money-making idea, I'll definitely call you at <cf>. Best regards!
Adventurer, I'm sorry. <cf>Actually, it concerns a request for another person: ......
A monster appeared on " <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>" and I asked a man named <cf>Aaron to investigate!
He was very confident <cf>that he had many times of experience in exploring archaeological sites!
So I left it in good hands.
But he didn't come back and ...... <cf>didn't hear from him, so I started to get worried.
I thought it would be rude to ask other adventurers to do this kind of thing <cf>Aaron
Please. <cf>Please go check on Mr. Aaron.
If I have overstepped my bounds, that's fine. <cf>My apologies to Mr. Aaron.
But if it's a <cf>monster that Mr. Aaron struggles with, he's in big trouble!
Please help them then. <cf>We will be happy to provide you with a reward for defeating them.
Mr. Aaron should be somewhere in "Shimmering Valley" <cf>
O God of Bapharia! <cf>Bless us, the faithful, and grant us your blessings.
I hope I'm overreacting <cf>but I'm worried because I haven't heard from you ......
Please make sure you are safe.
Hey, fellow competitor. I'm Aaron. <cf>Huh. I'm a self-proclaimed professional archaeologist.
Oh?　You and I have met somewhere before at ....... <cf>Huh. I feel like we're destined to be together.
Oh, Laure, you asked me to come here, didn't you? <cf>Huh. I'm sorry. It was a terrible mistake on my part.
The situation, as you can see, is not good. <cf>Huh ....... I guess I misjudged their capabilities a bit.
The guy behind " <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>" got me.
Somehow I managed to escape this far, <cf>but that was the best I could do.
Thank you for coming. I thank you. <cf>But I can't just leave like this.
It is a disgrace to <cf>adventurers to let dangerous monsters run wild!
Hoo ....... Don't tell everyone? <cf>Yes. We have to take him down.
There is a <value type="enemyName" id="E500_02_00_00000"/>at the back of " <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>". <cf>I want you to take him down.
Are you confident?
...... Huff. The fighting spirit in his eyes. <cf>There seems to be no doubt about it.
I leave my fate in your hands. <cf>Huh. Don't worry. I know you can do it.
Hu ....... The fighting spirit in your eyes is beautiful.
I leave my fate in your hands. <cf>Huh. Don't worry. I know you can do it.
Hmph. That's impressive. <cf>You're good at what you do.
Huh. A truly elegant and wonderful accomplishment. <cf>I can almost feel the gelashyness in my bones.
The monster that appeared at <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>was killed by <cf>your hand.
Now ...... Huff. One more thing, do this poor guy <cf>a favor.
My body still hurts. I don't think I can move for a while. <cf>Laure, please take me to your place.
Hmph. I'll ruin my name as an <cf>adventurer if I keep worrying about women. Come on, we'll be right back.
Hmph. I'll prove to you that you killed <cf>the monster from <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>!
But my body still hurts. <cf>I don't think I'll be able to move for a while.
I'm sorry, but I need you to take me to Mr. Laure at <cf>in Salamzart.
Mr. Aaron!　Thank God. <cf>I'm so glad you're both safe.
Huh. I would have been in danger without your help. <cf>In that sense, I owe it to you. Mr. Rolle.
Huh. How's that. With thanks <cf>and to celebrate our reunion, we're going to have dinner now.
I'm sorry. I have to report this time to the Temple at <cf>
Huh. That's not very good. <cf>But that's part of your charm, Laure.
We'll be sure to let you know what the adventurers have accomplished.
Thank you so much. <cf>I can't thank you enough.
Bapharia's heritage is important to people's lives. <cf>But its excavation is still fraught with danger.
In order to improve people's lives, <cf>research on archaeological sites is inevitably essential. ......
Huh. Don't be so anxious. <cf>That's why we adventurers are here.
Whether it's ruins or monsters, <cf>leave any danger to us.
Paving the way to the future is the mission of <cf>adventurers!
Hu......!　Done.
Yes, I know. I've asked the adventurers to solve <cf>this time as well, and I'm sure they'll be able to help.
Don't let your anxiety drive you to <cf>stop you in your tracks.
Adventurer. Thank you very much. <cf>Please keep us in mind if you need anything else in the future.
Hello, adventurer. <cf>I'd like you to pick something for me.
What I'm asking for is 'Miin's Muddy Eggs. <cf>' It's taken from <value type="enemyName" id="E014_00_00_02001"/>of ' <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>'
[What do you think the young people will think of <cf>?
In the old days, hunters used to use them a lot. <cf>They said these were the best tools for hunting.
I forget what's going on these days pretty quickly, but <cf>I do remember a lot of the old stuff.
I need to do some work on it once I find it. <cf>If you find it, will you bring it to my house?
Please pick a lot of them for me. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
Because "Miin's Muddy Eggs" can be found at <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E014_00_00_02001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>"!
To make it a hunting tool, <cf>it has to be modified once.
If you find it, will you bring it to our house?
Good job, adventurers. <cf>I see you've collected "Miin's Muddy Eggs."
I'm glad you picked so many. <cf>Now then, would you mind waiting for a moment?
I boiled water. <cf>I put an egg in the dip and did this like this: ......
...... Yes, it's ready. <cf>I need to do some prep work here, otherwise it's a lot of work.
Well then, would you please deliver this egg to a <cf>hunter named Jinbo?
I was originally consulted by Jinbo. <cf>I wish I could help that boy.
Oh, yeah. <cf>After you deliver it, come back here.
And I have to thank you. <cf>Because I might be in a bit of trouble.
Would you please deliver this egg to a hunter named Jinbo at <cf>in Salamzart?
After you deliver it, come back here.
Hmm?　 <cf>I'm the hunter gin. ......
What?　Grandma Maja called me <cf>"Jinbo"?
Oh boy. I don't think I'm <cf>old or skilled enough to be called a boy.
Well, from Grandma Maja's point of view, <cf>most of the people who live in this city are probably children.
So, you came on Grandma Maja's errand <cf>to bring me "Miin's Muddy Eggs"?
Actually, I've been on a non-hunting spree lately. <cf>I'm ashamed to admit it, but I've been having a bit of trouble.
So I talked to Grandma Maja about it and she told me about <cf>Salamzart's traditional hunting methods.
It's a way of using "Miin's Muddy Eggs" to lure <cf>their prey.
Oh, so these are eggs that have been pre-cooked. <cf>I heard they mash them and use them. ......
Ugh!　This is ...... a strong strange smell!
I see. <cf>So this smell is what attracts the animals.
No, but the smell is amazing. <cf>If it gets on my clothes, I'll be in trouble.
You all right? <cf>You might want to step away for a minute.
At least I know how to use it. <cf>I'm going to go hunting right now.
Are you going back to Grandma Maja? <cf>Well, tell her to look forward to the results.
But it smells amazing.
Welcome back. <cf>Aw, that's a great smell.
Jin-bo crushed the eggs right away, didn't he? <cf>He really is a naughty boy, isn't he?
I thought maybe the smell would transfer to you as well. <cf>Yes, I did. I've prepared some deodorizing herbs for you.
Just keep it on and the smell will be gone in no time. <cf>Sorry for the hassle.
Deserts, you know. It's a land of scarce fragrance. <cf>That's why strong odors spread easily.
That's why the smell of "Miin's Muddy Eggs" <cf>even animals in the distance notice and come closer.
It used to be a common hunting method in Salamzart and near here <cf>
The smell was too strong and the eggs were too difficult to handle. <cf>They fell into disuse before I knew it.
But I'm sure Jinbo will make good use of it. <cf>That boy is a fine hunter.
It was nice to see that you were able to leave a desert tradition behind. <cf>Thank you for everything. Kind adventurer.
Welcome. <cf>You will face more challenges in Dragon Claw Valley.
This time, you will not be conquering a normal path. <cf>This time, you will conquer a challenge for advanced players called "The Road to the Dragon.
In the past, "Dragon Claw Valley" was first stepped on by a team of <cf>adventurers called "Dragon Crow"!
Of course, this was a time when nothing had been done to investigate the situation. <cf>Countless monsters stood before them.
Overcoming many such difficulties, <cf>"Dragon Crow" became a legendary team!
This ordeal will relive that hardship.
It is a recreation of the legend of "Dragon Crow" to reach the same heights. <cf>It is called "The Road to the Dragon" with that meaning.
A novice adventurer would not be able to stand up to the challenge. <cf>But if we could break through, it would be a sure sign of our ability.
All adventurers who are considered top-notch have taken this path. <cf>You are well qualified to take on the challenge.
Of course, I'm not saying it's too much to ask, but how about ......?
<value type="locationName" id="dng009_Hard"/>". <cf>This is the ordeal known as "The Road to the Dragon".
Accomplish it with flying colors and come back here.
' <value type="locationName" id="dng009_Hard"/>' is <cf>an ordeal called "The Road to the Dragon."
A fledgling adventurer would be very hard to match, but <cf>you're more than qualified to take on the challenge.
' <value type="locationName" id="dng009_Hard"/>'. <cf>Accomplish it with flying colors and get back here.
Welcome back. <cf>You've broken through the "Road to the Dragon".
I can tell by the look on your face. <cf>It's the face of a powerful warrior who has overcome the odds.
It must have been a hard and arduous road. <cf>But you are now a first-class adventurer.
Congratulations!　You should be very proud. <cf>You have certainly proven yourself.
Many difficult paths will lie ahead of you <cf>
When you do, remember what you experienced today. <cf>Whatever hardship you are going through, I know you can overcome it.
We at the Pioneer Bureau welcome you once again! <cf>We are delighted to have you with us!
Now, my trusty compatriots. <cf>Report your accomplishments to the Pioneering Bureau.
Adventurer!　Help!
I'm looking for my sister Nora. <cf>But I haven't found her yet. ......
Nora is blind. <cf>That's why I made sure I was there for her.
I took my eyes off him for a minute and he was gone. <cf>Oh, where did he go?
They have to be somewhere in Salamzart. <cf>I don't think he's going to the desert at any price.
If you try to leave town, <cf>as expected, someone will stop you.
Ah!　But if someone was kidnapped or <cf>attacked by a monster, ......
Anyway, we need to find them fast! <cf>Find Nora with me!　Please!
Nora is blind. <cf>Anyway, we have to find her fast!
He must be somewhere in Salamzart! <cf>Please!　Find Nora together!
Nola!　I found it!
Is that your voice ...... brother?
You can't just leave the house by yourself! <cf>We were worried about you.
Sorry ....... <cf>I really needed to go somewhere.
A customer at the store told me about it.
'A luminous flower blooms in the desert at night. <cf>　The flower of light cures any eye disease."
I really wanted those flowers. <cf>And they're annoying me because I'm blind. ......
It's not a nuisance. <cf>You don't have to worry about that.
Besides, the story Nora heard is a fairy tale called <cf>"Moonflower".
It would certainly be amazing if it really existed, but ....... <cf>There aren't any flowers like that in the desert.
That's not true! <cf>Because I've seen it before!
No way. <cf>Come on, we're going home.
It's true! <cf>Flowers glowing in the desert at night. I remember!
Calm down, Nora. <cf>I told you it was a fairy tale.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I'll take Nora home first.
I'll make sure I pay you back. <cf>Can you come over to my house later?
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for finding Nora.
So, ...... can you do me another favor <cf>and ask them to listen?
Remember what Nora said earlier? <cf>She said she'd seen "Moonflower."
It can't be true. <cf>That guy keeps insisting he saw it.
You're so serious about this <cf>that I'm starting to get curious myself.
Maybe there really are "moon flowers" in the desert.
Once, my family and I walked through the desert at night. <cf>We didn't make it to camp in the light.
If Nora really saw the "Moonflower" <cf>that should be the time.
That's why I want you to go look for "Moon Flower". <cf>If you find it, I'll tell you.
If even Mr. Adventurer can't find it, <cf>I'm sure Nora will agree.
I just want to do what I can for Nora. <cf>I'm sorry to ask you to do something so hard.
The place is " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>". <cf>Please find "Moonflower" somehow. Please do!
I think if Nora really saw the "Moon Flower" it was when she walked <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"
If you can't find it by looking in that area <cf>I'm sure Nora would agree, so ......
Go find the "Moonflower" somehow. Please!
Something is reflecting the light. <cf>Could it be the 'moon flower' that Kurt mentioned?
I picked up "The Invisible Scale". <cf>Let's show them to Kurt.
Adventurer. Welcome back. <cf>Did you find anything in the desert?
What is this ......? Is it scales? <cf>But I've never seen transparent scales before.
Brother, do you have something in your hand? <cf>It's sparkly and beautiful.
What, ......?　Nora! <cf>You, you can see this!
Yes, I can see them. <cf>It's very strange, but I see it too.
Wow, that's amazing! <cf>This is what Nora saw!
But why is that? <cf>How can it be transparent and yet look like Nola?
Yes, I wonder if the doctor would understand. <cf>There's a doctor who has Nora's eyes checked out.
Can I have that person deliver it to you? <cf>He knows things. He might know something.
The "moon flower" that Nora saw was about this! <cf>But I can't believe that Nora could see it, even though it's transparent.
The doctor who is taking a look at Nora's eyes <cf>knows a thing or two, so he might know something.
The doctor is in town, so ...... <cf>can I have that person deliver it to you?
I am the doctor who is seeing Nora at ....... <cf>Oh, Kurt wants me to look into this?
I could see it in Nora, "Transparent Scales," ....... <cf>I see. Very interesting indeed.
I've been doing research on Bapharia's heritage and <cf>technology, in addition to my medical practice.
I was wondering if there are any <cf>tips in Bapharia's heritage about the treatment of Nora's eye.
But I didn't notice the desert substance. <cf>Oh, and the fairy tale "Moonflower."
The shape seems to resemble the scales of a shadow viper. <cf>But if you call them petals, they do look like that.
Maybe "moon flower" is the term for these "transparent scales" <cf>
Anyway, let's find out more. <cf>Could you go gather up the "Moonflowers"?
If the lore is correct, the "Moon Flower" blooms at night. <cf>Better to look for them in the desert at night.
I need a few more 'moon flowers' to examine in detail. <cf>Sorry, but could you gather some for me?
If the lore is correct, the "Moon Flower" blooms at night. <cf>You might want to look for " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" at night.
I see you've collected the "Moonflower". <cf>Thank you.
I have also been unpacking the literature of the Bapharia civilization. <cf>I found some interesting descriptions.
I'll check it out right away. Wait for me.
Thanks for waiting for ....... <cf>Thanks to you, I've learned a lot.
The true nature of the "Moon Flower" is the shadow viper's scales. <cf>However, they have been altered by the accumulation of large amounts of engrams.
It is apparently due to the action of desert vegetation. <cf>The "Moonflower" would have been found near the plant, right?
Apparently the plant's engrams pouring into the scales cause it to <cf>change to a transparent color.
And the "Moon Flower" has a mysterious power. <cf>Haven't you ever heard of it?
Sand Vipers and Shadow Vipers <cf>can sense the sight and presence of their prey without relying on their eyes.
According to literature, similar tools were used by the Bapharia civilization <cf>
Apparently the gods of Bapharia were able to use sound and vibration to <cf>accurately assess their surroundings.
I can't explain the details very well either, but you can see it at ....... <cf>Anyway, "Moonflower" could be used to treat Nora.
If you polish "Moon Flower" and make glasses <cf>that kid might be able to see things.
So I processed them into glasses. <cf>You can deliver these to him.
Can it be mass-produced? <cf>That would be difficult.
It takes a long time for the scales to transform. <cf>The "Moonflower" is a precious thing.
Besides, this is just an imitation of Bapharia's heritage. <cf>You can't give it exactly the same power.
However, it is clear that the path has been paved for the treatment of the eye. <cf>I have no doubt that medical science will develop further in the future.
For that I am grateful to you. <cf>It's a great accomplishment. Thank you.
Come on, enough talk. <cf>Hurry up and make those siblings happy.
I polished "Moon Flower" and processed it into glasses.
Maybe it will help that kid see things. <cf>Please deliver this to Kurt and Nora.
Mr. Adventurer! <cf>What did you say, doctor?
The "Moonflower" glasses: ....... <cf>With these, you might be able to see Nora's eyes: ......?
I wonder if it's true. ...... I'm kind of nervous. <cf>Here, Nora. This is it.
Okay, I'll call it. Okay, I'll try it.
...... What's up, Nora? <cf>You see my face?
...... No, I can't make out his face. <cf>But I can vaguely see the shape of your brother.
I see. ....... <cf>I'm sorry. I didn't fix your eye properly.
That's not true, brother!
Just knowing that I have an older brother <cf>makes me very happy!
I can properly see that the adventurers are there too. <cf>Thank you very much for doing this for me.
I couldn't see anything and it was pitch black until now. <cf>But now I can see a little bit of everyone.
I know that you're here. <cf>That's enough for me.
...... Yeah, I know. <cf>I'm very happy too!
Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for everything you did for my sister.
I was surprised that "Moon Flower" was a true story. <cf>
Keep up the good work and help Nora properly. <cf>Someday, I want to fix her eyes!　I'll do my best!
What, I left my goods at the grocery store? <cf>Ha ha ha!　That's ridiculous.
...... Yeah, that's the carrot I bought. I forgot about them. <cf>Thanks for delivering them to me: ......
Oops!　That's the fruit I bought. <cf>Did you deliver it all the way?
Thank you very much!　Nice store. <cf>I'll be buying a lot more from you next time.
I am a survey team dispatched by the Pioneering Bureau. <cf>I'm in charge of monitoring the star vein holes that appear here.
Did you deliver the relief supplies? <cf>Thank you. That's very helpful.
The star vein hole here also seems to have the same properties as the one that leads to <cf>"Void's Island"!
It leads to some strange place, <cf>and inside there's a hell of a monster!
If you plan on going in, be very careful.
I'll put together some research material. <cf>Could you please report what you just said to the Pioneer Bureau.
Are you here at the request of the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>I'm a member of the star vein pits survey team here.
The one that appears here is also a bad star vein hole. <cf>It's the one with the big monster inside.
It seems there is more than one place to connect. <cf>It's too dangerous, though, and it's hard to make progress on the research.
There may be requests going out to adventurers. <cf>If that happens, be careful and be prepared before you go in.
Would you please report this to the Pioneer Bureau as well? <cf>I know it's a lot of work, but thank you.
Hmmm, it's a strange plant. <cf>How does it bloom?
Thank you for taking on this project. <cf>Mr. Adventurer.
A customer left me a <cf>pot of yarrow!
Such long, hard spines. <cf>I've never seen them before either.
I think it's probably a plant from a distant country. <cf>I'm having trouble finding any information at all.
Adventurer. Could you please go to the Asterleeds Settlement Office and go to <cf>and look for the book?
In the stacks over there, I think I can find a book that says <cf>about this Ibarra.
I'm going to continue to try different soil, fertilizer, and other things over here at <cf>
Well, then, please do.
The library is located on the second floor of the Asterleeds Pioneer Station. <cf>Look for the book about the mysterious Ibarra!
I found a book called "Roses of the World."
Sulho asked me to <cf>It mentions hard thorny thorns.
'Fossil Rose. Also known as petrified rose. <cf>　A type of rose famous for its inability to flower."
'Legend has it that it angered the gods by injuring them with its long, hard thorns and <cf>was turned to stone before it blossomed.'
'Studies have shown that engram-rich soils can <cf>produce flowers.'
'Or by other means <cf>Fulfilling the engram leads to flowering.'
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Have you found out what the mysterious rose is?
Wow, it's called Fossil Rose? <cf>There are so many different kinds of roses in the world.
What is needed for flowering is a soil rich in engrams. <cf>Or to fill with engrams, or is it
...... then! <cf>You might be able to use "Goblin Briar"!
Goblin Briar is a member of the rose family. <cf>It has the characteristic of accumulating engrams.
If I graft this and a Fossil Rose, <cf>I might be able to get them to bloom successfully.
But Goblin Briar only grows wild in <cf>『 <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>』!
It is a dangerous place and I can't go near it. <cf>Could you go and collect them instead?
Please find the Goblin Briar at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" and <cf>. Please do so!
Please go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" and look for the <cf>"Goblin Briar" plant.
With that, you may have a blooming flower. <cf>Best regards!
Did you bring "Goblin Briar"?
Yes, this is the Goblin Briar. <cf>Thank you very much!
Well, I'll get right on it and try grafting the Fossil Rose to <cf>
Goblin Briar only produces modest flowers, and the <cf>engrams it accumulates are not much!
So people say, 'It's a worthless plant. <cf>But look, look!
I'm already seeing changes at <cf>on the Fossil Rose I just graced!
The thorns seem to be swelling up a bit ....... <cf>Maybe this wasn't a spine, but a thorn.
It won't bloom right away, but <cf>This will work!
A plant that accumulates engrams and a flower that needs engrams. <cf>Only when the two are combined can they lead to flowering.
There are so many more mysterious plants in the world <cf>!
Adventurers, thank you very much for your help <cf>
This could allow us to deliver <cf>new flowers to people all over the world!
When the Fossil Rose blooms, please come to <cf>to see it!
I wonder what kind of flower the Fossil Rose is. <cf>I'm looking forward to seeing it bloom.
Ugh, I'm so curious. ...... <cf>Who is that guy?
What kind of relationship do you have with Mr. Sulho? <cf>Is it too much to ask for something like this?
............. <cf>Oh, no!　I'm still curious!
Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for doing me a favor.
Sulho is a childhood friend of mine, <cf>a boy who works in a rose garden.
That Sulho boy was giving a bouquet of <cf>roses to his gay sister!
It's roses, a bouquet of roses! <cf>That's definitely what this is about, right?
I guess boys like that kind of gay guy <cf>after all. ......?
...... Oh, aww! <cf>Now that was nothing!
Anyway, I'd like to know what kind of relationship you two have <cf>!
My sister, she was wearing the uniform of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>Also, I dropped my handkerchief.
It was embroidered with the name "Cecil. <cf>I think his name is Cecil.
Could you also deliver this handkerchief? <cf>Then, please do me a favor!
Please deliver the <cf>handkerchief to Cecil at the Asterleeds Pioneer Station.
So, what's your relationship with Sulho, ....... <cf>Oh, like I want to hear it, but I don't. ......
Yes, I am. Cecil is me, ....... <cf>Do you have something for me, sir?
Oh, this handkerchief! <cf>I was looking for it. Thank you.
The person who picked it up in Minsterhorn is ....... <cf>I see. You dropped it there.
In fact, I wrapped something important inside. <cf>It was at ......!　Oh, thank goodness~!
This is a rose seed from the outer continent <cf>that Mr. Surjo at the rose garden asked me to get for him.
What?　You're dating Mr. Sulho? ......?
Haha!　How can that be? <cf>Sulho, you are still a child.
We deliver fertilizers, and they help us with plant research. <cf>We have that kind of business relationship.
I'm planning to put together a <cf>observation report on this seed as well, along with Suljo's grow!
By the way, adventurer, would you like to go back to <cf>Minsterhorn again?
If so, please deliver these seeds to Mr. Surho at <cf>
And I apologize if I drop it again. <cf>I'm sorry. Thank you very much.
Please deliver rose seeds to Mr. Surho of Minsterhorn at <cf>
I'm just going to talk to Sulho at work. <cf>He's a serious, kind and nice boy.
What?　You're delivering a package from Mr. Cecil?
Wow, I'm so happy. <cf>It's the outer continent rose seeds I asked for!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>That's right. Here's a bouquet of flowers to thank you.
This is a rose that I cut off in pruning. <cf>I was just using it as a little thank you.
I gave it to Cecil as well. <cf>Adventurers, please don't hesitate to do the same.
We have a lot of them. <cf>Oh, I'll give some to Monica, too.
Adventurer, are you looking for Monica-chan? <cf>Well then, please give her this bouquet of flowers.
I'm sorry if this sounds like an afterthought. <cf>I want to make Monica happy, so...
Please send flowers to Monica at Minsterhorn at <cf>
Hope you'll be pleased.
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Cecil, did you find it?
...... I see. <cf>So you were just a business associate.
Ho...... good. <cf>But then why a bouquet of roses ......?
What? <cf>A bouquet of roses for me from Mr. Sulho?
I'm so happy to hear that! <cf>Maybe, Mr. Suruho, you can find out more about me at ......!
...... pruned roses in return for ......? <cf>That doesn't mean anything deep. ......
Well, I guess I was wrong about everything then. <cf>Ugh, I'm so embarrassed. ......
But I think it's wonderful because it's so like you, Sulho. <cf>Because you take very good care of your flowers.
That part of him, I ....... <cf>Uh, uh, it's nothing. Heh heh heh.
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>It was really nice to get to know you, Suljo.
Sulho your roses ....... <cf>Smells so good!
Oh, no, no, no! <cf>I'm too scared of my master to take a step forward. ......
I have no guts. ...... <cf>But I can't just leave it like that. ......
Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Adventurer.
I am ashamed to say this. <cf>I've lost something terrible.
It is a light source used by miners. <cf>This is a bit special.
They use "Audal crystals" that do not emit soot. <cf>This is also very expensive!
I was carrying a barrel filled with these crystals. <cf>However, I bumped into a bunch of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>
I ate the foam, abandoned the cart and ran away and went back to ...... <cf>and the crystals were gone!
My master, Mr. Baumann, is a strict man. <cf>Even for free, I was not well made. ......
I'm sorry for making you do this. <cf>Please tell your master what happened.
Please tell Mr. Bauman at <cf>that I lost my luggage.
Oh, what's this? <cf>Isaac's son of a bitch left a message for you, huh?
...... Just threw out the "Audal Crystals"! <cf>Oh, come on, that's a lot of damage.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>The price tag is as good as you can get. <cf>I'm sure it's all been split up by now.
Isaac's an idiot ....... He's a dick, but <cf>I see some potential in that young guy.
I don't have the strength, I don't have the guts. <cf>But I have an eye for the stones.
It's a great talent. It would be a waste to destroy <cf>it with such a trivial thing!
Oh, yeah!　You get your crystals back <cf>and we'll be all set!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>It's not so hard if you're dealing with a "good" guy. <cf>You seem to be a very good player.
Get the "Audal Crystals" back and return them to <cf>Isaac.
Just bring him in again and we'll get back on track. <cf>I don't want to make a big deal out of this, either.
Think you can help us and that bastard Isaac <cf>with a little help?　Please!
I need you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>around here. <cf>He should have "Audal Crystals".
When you get the numbers you need, please deliver them to the bastard at <cf>Isaac's.
What is this? <cf>This is the "Audal crystal" that I lost!
Thank you for taking the trouble to get it back for me! <cf>I can't believe you went to the trouble of getting it back for me. ......
...... What? <cf>The master bowed to the adventurers and ......
...... I see. <cf>I'll go talk to my master honestly after all.
I ran away without making any sense, but my <cf>master saved me!
I'm sorry for all the trouble I put the adventurers through. <cf>I would not be a man if I did not apologize.
Let's go to the master. <cf>Please come with me, adventurers.
I'd like to put this story to bed and thank you <cf>
Oh, you're here. <cf>You're late, young man.
Oh, master, I am ......
You big asshole! <cf>You know why I'm mad?
It's not because you had the Audal Crystal stolen from you. <cf>It's because you ran away with your tail between your legs from your own responsibility!
Failure is inevitable. It doesn't help that I can't remember things. <cf>But be honest.
If you don't, you'll lose your job and your friends. <cf>Do you understand?
Yes, I am. Oyakata, I am sorry! <cf>I did an unforgivable thing!
I hid my failure, and then I brought others into it. <cf>It was all my fault!　I am sorry!
That's fine. <cf>We should have done that all along.
I'm not trying to get you fired. <cf>We're short on staff too.
My son, who was supposed to be my heir, has left home. <cf>I have no choice but to teach you guys the art.
If you're ready, <cf>I'll hold your ass as long as I have to. Don't forget.
Please contact the master at ....... Thank you very much. <cf>I will be forever in your debt!
Let me thank you again, too, adventurer. <cf>Thank you so much!
You've taken good care of me. <cf>Thanks a lot. We all owe you.
Because I'll train this young fellow up again. <cf>If you need anything else, please let me know.
Thank you for the "Audal Crystals" at <cf>!
My master gets angry at me, but I manage to do my best. <cf>Lately, it is strangely easy to find good stones.
I wonder if the adventurers got <cf>to bring good luck too. Hahaha!
Hmmm, what's this vein? <cf>I don't remember writing this stuff down.
I'm curious, but I'm also busy at work. ...... <cf>I wonder if there's anyone I can ask.
Oh, I'm glad you're taking care of it. <cf>I'm a miner's master around here.
My job is such that I've been working on a <cf>memorandum documenting the vein. It's been thirty years now.
I know all the mineral deposits in the area. <cf>I'm supposed to. ......
I found a vein of ore in my memorandum that I didn't know existed. <cf>Somehow, in different handwriting than mine.
I have an idea who wrote it. <cf>I'm more concerned about whether there really is such a vein of ore.
I want you to check that out. <cf>Go to the place in the memorandum and check it out.
It also politely mentions the stones that can be found there. <cf>Because finding the real thing would be the best proof of all.
First is a vein of "sharp striped stone". <cf>If you find it, can you bring it to me? Thank you.
Look for the "Great Litze Cave. <cf>You will find a stone with sharp stripes.
If you find it, can you bring it here? <cf>I'm counting on you. Thank you!
I found this in Baumann's memorandum: <cf>"Pointed Striped Stone."
There are several identical stones lying nearby. <cf>Let's bring them back and report to Baumann.
I see you've gone and checked the location of the memorandum.
This is the 'sharp striped stone'. <cf>Which one is it? ....... Oh, seriously?
This is "serpentine copper. <cf>It's not the kind of stone you find that close to the surface.
The crystals when rusted are used as medicine. <cf>You can sell them for a decent price.
I've been having a little trouble digging. <cf>If there's a vein like this, it would be a big help.
I'm starting to look forward to the next place. <cf>I hear you can find "red outcropping stones" here.
Go check out the local area for the same. <cf>I'm counting on you!
The next one is ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>'. <cf>You should be able to find "The Red Outcropping Stone."
I found this in Baumann's memorandum: <cf>"The Red Outcropping Stone."
You found the "Red Outcropping Stone"? <cf>Let me see it.
...... "[Burning Steel]"? <cf>This is pretty awesome!
It's a metal that combines engram and iron deep underground. <cf>It's highly heat resistant.
It is used in automobile engines. <cf>It's a rare ore and a luxury item.
I thought I knew all about these mountains, but <cf>I guess there's still a whole new vein of ore.
I'm suddenly inclined to trust the memorandum, man. <cf>Can you ask for the next place too?
Look for something called 'white slab stone. <cf>I'm kind of excited to see what you get this time.
Look for " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>". <cf>You should find a white slab stone.
I found this in Baumann's memorandum: <cf>"white slate stone."
The research for the memorandum is getting longer and longer. <cf>Sorry for the hassle.
Is this the "white slab stone"? <cf>...... Hmm?　This is another unusual one.
This is "Bapharia Marble". <cf>It's not an ore, it's some kind of ancient artifact.
It is said that the god Bapharia created it by transforming the <cf>earth to build a temple.
It's strong, lightweight, and a first-class building material, but <cf>I gotta deliver it to the Bapharia cult.
I'll just report it and let the Order do the rest of the digging. <cf>I'm sure there will be at least a reward.
Okay, next to last. <cf>They say this place will have a "shiny rock".
One more try, please.
Next up is "The Shining Stone". <cf>They say it's at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>".
This is the last time. Thank you. <cf>If you find it, will you bring it here?
I found this in Baumann's memorandum: <cf>"The Shining Stone."
I see you found "The Shining Stone". <cf>Good job. That's the last of it.
This is ....... Dude, I can't believe it. <cf>Golden.
The mines around here <cf>should have been dug up long ago!
Oh my god. ....... <cf>I'm losing it. I didn't realize I missed all this.
The only two people who can touch this memorandum are <cf>me and my son Einar.
Einar is the one who added the note. <cf>I didn't know you could be such a connoisseur of mineral deposits: ......
He had a gift for seeing stones <cf>and was a strong man.
He was the best miner I've ever seen. <cf>But he said he was going to be an actor.
He left the house without leaving it. <cf>I guess the memorandum is a souvenir.
I thought if he wanted to be an actor, I would let him do what he wanted. <cf>...... No, I still think
But it's too bad we have to see this. <cf>I want Einar to be in charge of this mine.
...... I'm sorry, I'm talking about my people. I'm sorry. <cf>I appreciate you running around with me.
Thank you. <cf>Here's your reward. Keep it.
If you ever meet my son Einar, ...... <cf>No, not really.
Don't tell them anything yet. <cf>Parents mustn't interfere with their children.
Top adventurers aren't just about competence. <cf>They're also full of star power.
It's like a unique aura or presence. <cf>You can tell a gem like that just by looking at it.
I've finally found you. <cf>You are the first of the glorious Adventurers Produce.
Once again, I'm Barni, your adventurer producer. <cf>I fully support you in your endeavors.
I'm still very confident in my eye for a commission. <cf>I'll bring you a good job, you can count on me.
You accomplish the request and are very successful! <cf>You'll get an achievement and a cool nickname!
That's how we build our reputation and handle more advanced requests. <cf>My role is to operate this place efficiently.
Eventually, we'll turn your exploits into an adventure story or play and <cf>sell it in a big way!
Your fame is growing and your popularity is only going to increase! <cf>Eventually, you may even get a client who wants to hire you.
That way you'll get paid handsomely. <cf>Just talking to new adventurers will pay for itself.
What do you think?　You can have this dream life. <cf>And for that, you're going to have to listen to my instructions very carefully.
Well then, this time I'm going to ask you to take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>". <cf>The bandits on " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>" seem to be on a bit of a roll lately.
Everyone is annoyed with you and that's why you're so high profile. <cf>You now make a name for yourself as a 'bandit killer'!
Here's your first step to glory. <cf>Beat up <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>with <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>!
Go on!　My "Bandit Killer"!
Take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>"!
Welcome back. <cf>Looks like you beat " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>".
Oops, don't be hasty. <cf>We don't want you to be satisfied with this level of achievement.
You are strong enough and have star power. <cf>With the right production, you could win the world.
As the "Bandit Killer" who takes down the evil bandits who attack people <cf>you will be super popular!
So, let's try to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>, an addition to <cf>, with <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>as well!
In the meantime, I'm going to make a pitch to the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>When you are done, please come to the Pioneer Bureau's tent.
By the time you return, <cf>your success story will unfold. ......
Now, go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>". <cf>Go kick the crap out of " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>"!
Take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>"!
I'm going to the pioneer station in Salamzart. <cf>When you are done, please come over there.
Have you finished defeating " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>"? <cf>Thanks for your hard work
Wait a minute. <cf>I'm in the middle of a conversation.
Hey, can you think about this a little more? <cf>This is an opportunity for both of us.
So, currently, the Pioneer Bureau is not looking for <cf>such personnel!
We have had other people take down bandits. <cf>We can't give preferential treatment to certain adventurers.
Defeating the bandits is just a prelude! <cf>We're going to make a big job of it in the future.
What do you think?　This star-studded figure! <cf>This is not what "Bandit Killer" is capable of!
Now, please come back after you have completed your big job. <cf>We'll talk to you then. Excuse me.
Wait a minute! <cf>Don't listen to me!　First of all, ......
Oh, my God! <cf>The Pioneer Bureau has a hard head.
But you can't call yourself a <cf>producer if you give up on this.
You did a great job! <cf>I knew I was right!
This time it was too easy, and that's not good enough. <cf>Next time I'll bring you a job so big you won't be able to complain.
Until then, don't forget my face and name. <cf>See you later!
Not "Bandit Killer." <cf>You're doing great today. I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
This time I'll find a big job <cf>where I'll be well known and have a bang up track record. I'll be waiting for you!
Hmmm, I'm not sure I want to be so blunt about it. <cf>I don't want things to get awkward. ......
I wonder how I should treat them in such situations. <cf>It's not right to meddle in my subordinate's private life, is it?
I'm sorry you had to take me on. <cf>My miner, Akka, hasn't been working at all lately.
I don't mean illness or injury. <cf>I think it's something that's troubling you.
I think, or rather, Akka is distressed!
It's a private thing. <cf>Akka has a girlfriend.
And he came to me for advice, saying, ["]I want to propose ["]to you. <cf>[I answered, "["]Why don't you do it?
And then a little while later, <cf>, things got crazy for Akka.
I mean, what the hell?　I think my advice was bad <cf>and Akka got Declined for proposing ......!
I'm responsible for this, aren't I? <cf>No, maybe not.
But I feel that way! <cf>Oh, I shouldn't have said anything else!
Worst case scenario, I'll have to be the go-between! <cf>Please!　Go clarify the situation!
Mr. Adventurer?　What do you want from me?
...... just because you're not putting in the work <cf>Rasha's worried about you?
Nothing is bothering me. <cf>My life is fine!
I would say ....... <cf>I guess I can't fake that anymore.
Actually, you know, I talked to <cf>Rasha to propose to her.
Then I lost my proposal <cf>"Ring of Silver and Red Jade".
I mean, it's not like a failed proposal or anything. <cf>It's more like a problem before that. ......
I think I dropped it in the <cf>river at the Litze Great Cave in " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>"
I was depressed because of it. <cf>It affected my work too. I'm so pathetic!
What is ......, eh?　Rasha thought <cf>the proposal failed and ......
You're trying to make peace with yourself! <cf>That's not a good idea!
I haven't told her anything yet! <cf>It's bound to get complicated!
That's right!　Adventurer, please! <cf>Go find the ring!
As long as I have that, it's all round! <cf>I'll keep Mr. Rasha around, I'll keep him around!
The "Ring of Silver and Red Jade" is down in the <cf>river at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>!　I'm asking for it!
Did you find the "Ring of Silver and Red Jade" I dropped at <cf>?
It should be down in the river at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>'! <cf>Hurry up and find it!
I found a "Ring of Silver and Red Jade". <cf>It has the names of Akka and a woman engraved on it.
It's definitely a proposal ring. <cf>I'll deliver it to Akka.
Adventurer! <cf>I see you've found "The Ring of Silver and Red Jade."
Thanks for the help! Now I can manage. <cf>Well, Rasha found out in the end.
You're so stupid, already!　If you lost your ring, <cf>you should have talked to me sooner.
You know how worried I was? <cf>I almost accidentally asked her.
Was ["]Akka's proposal that bad? ["] <cf>What a mess!
No, seriously, give me a break! <cf>Mr. Rasha even gave me an advance on my salary.
I couldn't afford to cause any more trouble. <cf>So I kept quiet.
But I'm sorry I left a hole in my work. <cf>I'm sorry about that.
You're an important part of our team. <cf>I don't care about the money.
I'm going to make sure you continue to make good money. <cf>It would hurt us more if you stopped working for us.
Anyway, if you found the ring, that settles it. <cf>I hope to hear a good report this time!
I am indebted to you! <cf>I'll keep working hard!
Oh no, that was close. <cf>You almost ruined your man's proposal.
You, too, thank you very much. <cf>You did a great job!
Akka seems happier these days.
Sounds like the proposal went well. <cf>What do you think?　I should probably ask for more details!
Oh, work? <cf>It's tough being an adventurer!
I'd ask you to do the same if I could, but <cf>it's a bit of a publicity stunt.
If the priest there doesn't agree, I can't <cf>make the request.
I guess I'm in trouble too. <cf>I'm sure I could convince someone to refer me or something. ......
If you ever get introduced as an adventurer, <cf>I'll talk to you again!
Oh. <cf>Welcome to such a place.
Hmmm ....... You. <cf>Jake, you were the one who complimented me.
He is skilled and well-spoken. <cf>I hear you are a first-rate adventurer who can be trusted.
Do me one favor.
There is a doctor in Larpal named Volker. <cf>He says he has a somewhat tricky job.
I need his help. <cf>I am, as you can see, already retired.
If I say my introduction, Volker will understand. <cf>Please do me the favor.
If you find Volker in Larpal, go to <cf>and talk to him.
Hey, what's up? <cf>You looking for a job?
You know what I'm asking you to do, ....... <cf>I'm a little afraid I can't be too open about it.
If the priest here doesn't agree, <cf>I can't ask him to do the job.
I hope someone referred you: ......
Hmm, what? <cf>Did you get introduced to the guy on the roof of the pioneer station?
I see!　Then don't worry. <cf>I'll introduce you to a former top adventurer from the Pioneer Bureau!
All right, I'll leave you to it. <cf>I've got a problem. I need your help.
Oh, will you take care of it? <cf>I'll let the priest over here explain what's going on.
I'm Kilmeyer. Pleased to meet you. <cf>I was sent by the Order of Bapharia.
First, this request is confidential. <cf>Please do not mention the job outside the office.
That's why I was picking on people. <cf>Sorry if I offended you.
Now, let's get down to business.
If you're an adventurer, you may have heard about this. <cf>There's a rumor going around these days that
["]It's rumored that the transformation of ordinary animals, subhumans, and humans will give birth to <cf>avaritia["]......
Decline, this is not true. <cf>At least not an event that has been confirmed by the Order.
Fear of avaritia has probably given birth to <cf>unfounded stories
But some of them really believe it. <cf>That one day they too will be transformed.
And there are some strange drugs on the market these days.
It's called "Avaritia Prophylaxis. <cf>Apparently, someone is selling it.
It's so obvious it's shady. <cf>Adventurers and <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>are falling for it.
By the way, I hear they're going for a hell of a lot of money. <cf>That's a knee-jerk reaction!　Gahaha!
And I'd like to see what that drug is, so <cf>I'm going to need you to get it for me.
It's too late for this to get out to the public. <cf>We want to make sure we address this while we can.
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" in Asteria Plain. <cf>I've heard it's been circulating amongst the <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>people at that location.
They are a tough bunch of guys that haunt that place. <cf>Be careful not to let your guard down.
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" to defeat " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>" and get <cf>"Avaritia Prophylaxis"!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" and take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>". <cf>They should have "Avaritia Prophylaxis".
The <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>guys in that area are tough. <cf>You need to watch out for them.
Hey, good job. <cf>Did you get the "Avaritia Prophylaxis"?
Oh, this is the guy. <cf>Well, let me analyze it a little.
Gahaha!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>You idiots! <cf>You believed this stuff was medicine?
This is all water mixed with flavoring and sugar. <cf>It's a little sweet juice.
Even this stuff will make you feel better if you drink it. <cf>It's that effective, though.
They're sweet, those guys! <cf>Only for sugar!　Gahaha!
I knew it was just a sham and a scam. <cf>I guess that's a relief.
But whoever made this fake drug seems to have knowledge. <cf>Or at least they know about avaritia.
Unless you're a priest or an adventurer in direct contact with that thing, <cf>you'd only know it from myths or fairy tales.
Without some knowledge, <cf>the idea of prophylactics would never have occurred to me!
If it's priests who are involved, they are ...... <cf>traitors. Not even allowed to exist.
I will try to follow the drug sales route. <cf>If anything comes up, I need to turn to you again.
You have proven yourself in this one case. <cf>You should be proud.
Kilmeyer's been busy checking <cf>for that drug, you know.
I gave the stuff you brought me to <cf>to the neighborhood kids.
It was a cheap knockoff, but <cf>those guys were a delight.
Wooden carvings in the shape of the "Pillar of Divinity" are a popular souvenir at <cf>
If you hang it in your home, <cf>you'll be thankful for it!
I heard that the wood carvings of "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>make good souvenirs.
I heard it's a blessing. ...... <cf>They don't have the materials to make them right now.
That's too bad. If you see a craftsman named Uro, tell him <cf>["]Next time, let me buy it["].
If you see a craftsman named Uro, <cf>ask him about it!
Oh, welcome. <cf>I'm the one who makes the wood carving of "Pillar of Divinity.
It is a popular souvenir of Larpal. <cf>People often buy them as souvenirs of their pilgrimage.
Just sorry to have you visit, but <cf>I can't make wood carvings right now because I don't have the materials!
Huh?　Did the tourist say <cf>["]Let me buy next time["]?
That makes me happy. <cf>Hearing you talk like that makes me want to go the extra mile.
I can't whine about it, you know. <cf>Will you do me one favor?
The lumber I use comes from <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"!
There are <cf>traces of ancient people living in that area.
That's where you'll find <cf>"prehistoric wood" that's so old, we don't even know the name!
It is easy to process and extremely strong. <cf>It hardly corrodes at all.
However, it's a lot of work to go get it. <cf>It's a place where monsters can come out too.
We have no choice but to ask adventurers like you. <cf>I want you to bring me the "Ancient Wood.
Look for " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>". <cf>You will find "Ancient Wood".
Did you bring the "ancient wood"? <cf>Thank you very much.
How was " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"? <cf>I think it was quite a nice view!
...... Oh?　All I see are little pieces. <cf>This is a little strange.
It's a lot more rugged and rough, but you can see it at ....... <cf>You can even see some of the work that has been done on them!
...... Oh, it looks familiar. <cf>This is the same make as the goblin's tools.
It seems that goblins are raiding that area <cf>and collecting "ancient wood"!
We've got some serious business enemies out there, you know. <cf>This is not the way to do business, you know.
Could you please search the goblin settlements? <cf>There might be some "big old timber" there.
I can't do my job without it. <cf>Please, please, please take care of it.
I want you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>and look for goblin settlements at <cf>
You'll find 'big old timber'!
I found a "big old timber".
Let's get it to Uro.
Did you find the "big old timber"?
......Yes, this is it. <cf>If it's this big, I can use it for work.
Oy. The timber over here ...... <cf>has already been processed into wood carving work!
Let's call it "Goblin Wood Carving". <cf>It's similar to ...... 'Pillar of Divinity'!
It is decorated to evoke an image of wickedness <cf>but ......
They have a mythology too, and maybe the "Pillar of Divinity" plays an important role in it <cf>!
Goblin Culture ....... <cf>I had no idea there was such a thing, but
When I see it like this, <cf>I feel bad about taking it sideways!
Even though we don't understand them, <cf>they must have worked very hard to carve them in their own way!
I'm sorry to keep repeating this, but <cf>can I have this returned to the settlement?
As a woodworker, I can't use this as material. <cf>I'm sorry, but I'm counting on you.
I want <cf>"Goblin Woodcarving" back to the goblin settlements of " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"!
The "Goblin Woodcarving" was returned to its original state.
I'll tell Uro.
You returned "Goblin Woodcarving" to me at <cf>. Thank you.
That wood carving gave me a lot to think about.
From our point of view, the goblin beliefs are nothing more than superstitions that have nothing to do with <cf>the god of Bapharia.
But I guess they think that about us too <cf>
While looking at the same "Pillar of Divinity" <cf>you are fitting a different story into it.
We both see the world through completely different eyes. <cf>Each has its own language and its own art.
It is ...... <cf>somehow sad that we don't understand, that we can't understand each other!
And ...... are we really telling the right story? <cf>I'm starting to feel that way.
No. ...... this is a blasphemy against the God of Bapharia. <cf>They want us to forget about it.
Thank you very much. <cf>I feel like you've given me a lot of insight.
I'm trying my hand at <cf>marquetry with the first little piece of lumber you brought me!
The impression of the tree changes depending on the combination. <cf>This is interesting. I think it will sell well.
Yeah, I think this is the place to do business. <cf>Sounds good to me.
Now it's time to get busy!
Oh, man. <cf>I'm trying to do business here.
But it looks like some guys are attacking <cf>travelers on the road between Salamzart and Litze.
The identity of the other party?　That's the one. ......
Apparently it was a female adventurer. <cf>There are a couple of guys who say they saw her.
He says his name is "Tsuruka. <cf>I want you to teach him a lesson.
They're at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>" in Evergreen Desert.
Why would an adventurer do such a thing ......? <cf>Anyway, find Tulka.
There's a female adventurer named Tsurka at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".
I heard he's been attacking travelers. <cf>Go and teach him a lesson.
Have you come to punish me because I am attacking travelers?
You must be joking. <cf>I would never do such a despicable thing.
I call myself an adventurer. <cf>I would never hurt anyone.
Who in the world told you that?
A street vendor guy named Garb ......? <cf>That name doesn't sound familiar.
However, I do have an idea of who it is that attacks travelers. <cf>He is a variant of the Canny Mook Archer.
It's called " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>" and is tougher than <cf>other canny-mooc archers.
I ran into him once and chased him off. <cf>Maybe they saw us fighting?
Okay, maybe that's why they misunderstood me.
Sorry. Can you help me <cf>to clear my name?
We want to take down " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>"
But you might miss them if you go it alone. <cf>I need you to split up and look for them.
He is in Montegnor Valley at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>". <cf>Let's find him and take him down!
You took down " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>". <cf>That's what I'm talking about.
I struck out on my part. <cf>But I did get rid of Mook, who I thought was a lackey.
For what it's worth, <cf>I'm so glad it was you who came to me.
If it had been another adventurer who Accepted the request, <cf>we might have been fighting a misunderstanding.
Because no one would benefit from such a situation.
Now, I suppose you are going to report back to your client? <cf>I wonder if I could accompany you.
It was not Tsurka that was attacking the travelers. <cf>I have to let you know that it was ' <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>'.
Oh, how'd it go? <cf>Did you beat up the lady adventurer?
Hmm?　Who are you?
Are you the client? <cf>I am Tsurka. I'm an adventurer.
Tsurka is ....... <cf>Eh!　Hey, why did you bring him here!
You're an adventurer attacking travelers!
That is a misunderstanding. <cf>It is preposterous that I would attack a traveler.
The culprit is " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>". <cf>An adventurer who Accepted your request took him down.
And they also cleared my name.
Yeah!　Is it true?
That's a very hasty decision. Oh, man.
Mr. Tsurka. <cf>I'm sorry for the misunderstanding!
No, you just have to understand.
The monsters that used to attack travelers are gone. <cf>That's something to rejoice about.
That's right. <cf>Now I can go into business with some peace of mind.
You are a great adventurer! <cf>I'm glad I asked. Thanks a lot!
Oh, it's you! <cf>How are you doing?
As you can see, I'm getting ready to do business. <cf>I may ask you for something else, so please do me a favor.
Let's see, east is right and ....... <cf>Left is the one with the shield, ......
All right, all right! <cf>You got most of the way there?
Um, excuse me! <cf>Dragon Claw Valley" is that way, right?
Oh, it's okay!　I know. <cf>I'm just asking!
Well then!
It's nothing like "Dragon Claw Valley" <cf>It ran in the direction of the day after tomorrow ......
They may be lost. <cf>If you see him somewhere, call out to him.
...... if you can find it.
Um, sorry, ....... <cf>Is this the "Dragon Claw Valley"?
I would have headed straight from Asterleeds, but <cf>I found myself in this desert and ...... hot!
I don't think it was ever this hot of a place! <cf>Please let me know how to get there!
Thanks! <cf>So, which way is "Dragon Claw Valley"?
………………？
………………………………？？
<span size="Big">...... eh, eh? &lt;/&gt;
Oh, I'm sorry! <cf>I didn't understand what you were trying to explain to me.
I've always been like that! <cf>I can't remember the way at all. ......
Please. <cf>Take me to the Dragon Claw Valley!
Wow!　We're here!
Thanks for bringing me here! <cf>So this is the "Dragon Claw Valley"!
I would have been lost forever without you.
I'm looking for an ore called 'Featherstone'. <cf>I think I can find it in " <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>".
It was a request from a scholar. <cf>That's how I wanted to get here.
So, um, ....... <cf>If you don't mind, I was wondering if you could help me find it with me.
...... Actually, I've already forgotten how to get here. <cf>I can never go home alone!
Wow, my silly!
I'd like you to find me 5 "Featherstones". <cf>For my silly me, too: ......
I'll pick it up too, of course. <cf>Let me join you back here when you're done.
No, it's okay!　I won't go far. <cf>I can come back here indeed!　Maybe ......
I'm sorry!　I'm sorry! <cf>Please, please, please!
I need you to look for <cf>"Featherstone" in " <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>"
I'll look for it right here in the neighborhood. <cf>It would be hard if I can't come back. ......
You picked up Featherstone for me. <cf>Thank you!
Featherstone is a mysterious stone. <cf>When you strike it like this: ......
You see, it becomes lighter and floats!　Isn't that fun?
A scholarly teacher said. <cf>He said that when you hit it, it changes the internal structure.
Some say if you leave it alone, the wind will blow it <cf>somewhere else.
Haha, sounds like me.
This lightening property has been used for a long time and is often found at <cf>the Bapharia ruins.
In some cases, he said, they would lighten the weight when they were tapped. <cf>Looks like it was used to carry heavy things.
You helped me accomplish my request. <cf>Thank you so much.
Well then, let's head back to Asterleeds.
Of course, because I'm forgetting directions. <cf>...... Let me know which way to go in Asterleeds.
Don't worry. It's close by so you won't get lost! <cf>I forgot the way to ...... but it's okay!
...... maybe. I'm sure, yeah. <cf>I'm sure it's ...... okay ...... but
Asterleeds is over there ....... <cf>Minsterhorn is over here ......
The top is north, so go to ....... <cf>OK!　I think I got most of it!　...... maybe
Huh, I'm the strongest and loneliest hero ....... <cf>No one can possibly stand against me.
I will never be the strongest! <cf>As long as no one surpasses me!
We meet again! <cf>You who were the strongest and lone Soldier, you who surpassed me!
The old me is no more. ...... <cf>I am the strongest and loneliest hero reborn!
I challenge you again to a match!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>appears in this " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>"
The one who kills the most of them wins.
Listen and be amazed. <cf>I've already killed 9 <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>!
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>If you kill 10 of them, you win!
When you win, <cf>I'll tell you why I'm a hero!
Hoo ....... It's not that easy. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>Try to kill 10 of them!
Try to kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>".
If you can do that, you win. <cf>If you can do it!
<span size="Big">What the heck? &lt;/&gt;
Did you really beat <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>by 10?
Damn. ......!　I have to admit. <cf>You win. ......
As promised, I'll tell you. <cf>I'll tell you why I'm a hero.
This world is a wild place. <cf>Go a little off the beaten path and monsters will attack you.
Adventurers and Bapharia guards would help. <cf>But if not, the village will be overrun by them.
Those without power hunker down, kill their breath, <cf>and just pray that the storm will pass.
That's a hard thing to do. ...... <cf>That's why I became an adventurer.
To be a hero to save a small village!
If only our heroes had <cf>my village would not have perished. ......
...... No, it's nothing! <cf>Heroes don't deserve sentimentality!
Look forward!　And shatter your destiny! <cf>Now, on to the next game!
This time, you're in for something different. <cf>We're targeting the big boys who run amok in Montegnor Valley.
' <value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>' ....... <cf>This guy is trolling around " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>".
He may eventually attack Litze. <cf>We have to take this guy down before that happens.
It is heroes who respond to people's grief!
<cf>Who can beat " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>" at first? It's a game!
Let's use <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>to take down <cf>and <value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>!
The first one to take them out wins! <cf>Go ahead, if you want to go first. I'm ready.
Okay, I'm ready to go. <cf>It's time to leave: ......
You already beat " <value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>"!
I didn't think they would lose. ...... <cf>How swift!　You've gone beyond time!
All right. This time I lose! <cf>But I'm not giving up!
Heroes always rise again! <cf>Farewell until the next time we fight!
...... and before that. <cf>Receive your rewards for defeating monsters.
You did a great job saving people. <cf>I'll give you the title of hero!
So, once again, farewell!
A new hero. <cf>Wait until I rise again!
Don't worry. I will be strong. <cf>I will never let you down!
Hoo ....... I'm looking for a legendary flower. <cf>But it's a very difficult thing to find.
Hoo ....... The only clue is the legend. <cf>Must be a beautiful and fragile flower!
Hu ....... Thanks. <cf>It's nice to have your help.
What I am looking for is a desert flower. <cf>A very rare flower, as legend has it.
Its name is "Kouka". <cf>Hu....... A flower of light blooming in the desert. ...... That's so ephemeral.
Hu ....... <cf>I need you to gather some intel on Salamzart.
A merchant named Ardlung. <cf>I heard he was talking about "Kouka".
Hoo ....... I'll continue to gather info here at the oasis. <cf>Let me know if you find any leads.
Hoo ....... I'll take care of this, you go! <cf>Oh my god.
Hu ....... Talk to Mr. Ardlung, a merchant in Salamzart, <cf>.
He must know about "Koka".
Hello, adventurer. How can I help you?
Oh, you are talking about "Kouka"? <cf>Yes, I have heard rumors.
I am a jeweler and <cf>"Kouka" is considered to be as valuable as a gemstone!
The petals of "Kouka" have the property of shining at night. <cf>It is said that their brilliance is like that of a jewel.
And I hear it can be processed like a real gem.
I would love to see it!
I sent out a survey team before too, but they couldn't find <cf>"Kouka"!
Yes, yes. I spoke to a <cf>scholar named Ferena at the time!
I believe you live in Salamzart. <cf>If you're looking for "Kouka", why don't you pay them a visit?
I'm sure you know more about it than I do, Ferrena.
You can learn more about the legend of "Kouka" at <cf>Ferena
Since you live in Salamzart, you might want to visit <cf>
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can I help you?
'Kouka' ......?　You are looking for something unusual.
Yes. There is a legend in this region. <cf>It's a mysterious flower that blooms in the desert and emits light.
--Once upon a time. Once upon a time, there was a man who had a "Koka" in his hand. <cf>The man was so happy that he wanted to make money out of it.
The man was greedy and raised the price anyway. <cf>It was a rare flower, so the price was unbelievable!
In the end, a very wealthy man decided to buy "Kouka". <cf>But ......
Kouka" died before we could finalize business negotiations.
This is a kind of fairy tale. <cf> The lesson of "["]don't be greedy["], you know.
There are people who take this story to heart and look for "Kouka", but I have not heard of anyone <cf>getting it!
It's just like the fairy tale. <cf>It's just that greed doesn't work.
[A man kissed the night sky and got a "light flower" ["]"] or something like that.
I am not sure what it means, but that is the passage. <cf>For your information.
["]A man kissed the night sky and got a 'light flower' ["]......
I don't know what you mean, but you might try telling <cf>your client
Huh ....... <cf>Looks like you got the "Kouka" story in one piece.
How ...... is it a passage from a fairy tale? <cf>["]A man kissed the night sky and got a 'light flower' ["]......
Hoo ....... <cf>Kissing the night sky sounds so romantic!
Hu ....... I heard about it from a Bapharia priest. <cf>I heard from a Bapharia priest that "Koka" is a kind of Bapharia heritage.
Its petals emit light even after they fall. <cf>Ancient people tried to overcome the darkness of the night with it
The source of light is the strong life force that blooms even in the desert. <cf>[When joy poured down to the sand, the flower bloomed.
Huh ....... I see. <cf>I get it. The truth about "Kouka" is...
The "Light Flower" is obtained by kissing the night sky. <cf>And when joy falls on the sand, it blossoms.
'Kiss' is 'joy. <cf>Hoo ....... So, all the plants need is water that makes them happy.
When the man in the fairy tale got his "light flower", <cf>it must have been raining by accident!
Huh ....... Amazing. <cf>We had a faint shower around here a few days ago.
If you try to collect at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>", you may find <cf>"Kouka"!
Hoo ....... <cf>Nevertheless, let's be prepared in case our guesses are off!
I'll try to find a way to kiss the night sky. <cf>If I could really kiss it, wouldn't that be nice?
I'll leave the collecting to you at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>". <cf>Go look for "Kouka" for me.
Did you find "Kouka"?
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>" and collect plants. <cf>You may find "Kouka".
Hu ....... That's what I'm talking about. <cf>Looks like you got "Kouka".
Hu ....... <cf>It's wonderful. Too beautiful.
I think I understand why people in the past sought them out.
Hu....... <cf>A flower born by divine miracle in Bapharia?
Even if it is destined to wither eventually, <cf>I will never forget this beauty and fleeting light.
It's romantic. <cf>This is why I can't stop being an adventurer.
Hu ....... Thanks. <cf>I couldn't have gotten it without your help.
Hoo ....... This is your reward. <cf>Don't say a word, just take it.
Hu....... <cf>The legend of "Kouka" could not be unraveled alone.
I love it when adventurers cooperate with each other.
I'm just mixing up some medicine.
You say the smell is too strong? <cf>Hahaha, that's what comes with good medicine.
Do you know an adventurous woman named Tulka?
I heard she's not feeling well. <cf>I'm worried.
I've had Tulka save me from monsters <cf>before.
I wanted to thank you for that. <cf>I need you to deliver the concoction to me.
I tried to visit him once, but Tsurka was not feeling well, but he went out <cf>Accepting the request.
They are at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>'. <cf>Find him and give him his medicine.
Could you deliver the medicine to the adventurer, Tsurka.
She should be at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>'
Geehaw...... gohaw...... gohaw......
Hmm ......?　What is it?
Goho...... What? <cf>Quan the medicine man asked you to bring him some medicine?
Goho ...... I see. I appreciate the sentiment, but...
I'm on my way to <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>now to take down the guy. <cf>We can't just throw the request out in the middle of the road.
I will not give in to disease. <cf>So, I don't need drugs. ...... ugh!
Goho, goho goho!　Gho, gho, gho, gho!
Uu....... ...... to take it easy?
Damn ...... that doesn't look good. ...... <cf>But it's harder than I thought: ......
Sorry. Can you ...... take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>for me ......
It's an urgent request. ...... <cf>I can't take the medicine for that ...... reason.
After completing the request, go to Quan and talk to him.
I promise you. So, I'm sorry, but <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>we need you to take them down.
Gosh, gosh!　Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>to take down ......
Come back when you're done. <cf>We'll go to Quan together. ...... Geho, Geho!
Gosh, gosh, gosh! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>You've taken down the
Thanks so much. <cf>Yeah ...... my health seems to be getting worse ......
Gosh, gosh gosh gosh ......! <cf>I know I should take my meds. ......
Anyway, let's go back to Quan once ......
As promised, I'll tell you what happened. <cf>I owe you a debt of gratitude for the commission on my shoulders.
Hi, Quan. ....... Gosh, gosh, gosh.
Tsurka!　What's the matter? <cf>Were you that sick?
You have the medicine that was delivered to you. Take them right away!
Gosh gosh ...... no, I can't take those pills ......
I hate to say it, but ...... <cf>I can't take bitter pills ......
I was ashamed to call myself an adventurer. <cf>So I avoided the drug itself.
I'm sorry for any favors I may have done you or anyone else. ......
I didn't know that. ...... <cf>Then you should have told me earlier.
Then I'll concoct a less bitter potion. <cf>I'll take care of it.
You. I'm sorry, I need you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/><cf> and pick up a medicinal herb called "Aoamaduru".
With it, you can make a medicine that isn't bitter.
I'll let Tsurka rest here. <cf>Sorry to keep you waiting, but thank you for your cooperation.
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>" and collect a medicinal herb called <cf>"Aoamaduru".
I'm sorry I've asked you to do so many things. <cf>I just need a little more help.
Did you find the blue crane?
Thank you! <cf>Now I can make medicine that isn't bitter.
Come on, Tsurka. <cf>I think even you can drink this.
Gosh!　...... sorry ......
It's true ...... it's not bitter. <cf>I can drink this: ......
Phew ...... feeling better ....... <cf>Coughing seems to be calming down too.
Good. <cf>Now all I need is a good night's rest and I'll be fine.
Next time you're not feeling well, <cf>talk to me right away.
Oh. <cf>I'll let you do that from now on.
But please keep my story about my inability to take bitter pills a <cf>secret.
Can you not tell anyone either? <cf>It's a secret between the three of us, you, me and Quan.
I'm still, you know. <cf>I'm inevitably embarrassed. ......
Hello. <cf>Do you have any physical problems?
Tsurka is now taking his medicine. <cf>Thanks to you. Thanks a lot.
I was cleaning out the attic. <cf>There was so much dust.
It's a place I've been neglecting for a long time. <cf>There were things in there that I had forgotten about.
I found something that looks like <cf>Bapharia heritage in the attic of our barn.
According to the note that was with it, <cf>it was borrowed from someone by his dead father.
No matter how long ago it was, <cf>we can't afford to keep borrowing.
That's where I want you to find the person you owe.
It said 'on loan from Ma'. <cf>Maybe it's a nickname for the other guy.
It's an easygoing atmosphere, and I think <cf>it's one of Salamzart's residents.
I'd say someone of my dad's generation is ...... <cf>and Mr. Samuel.
She's a grandmother who knows things. <cf>You might recognize the name 'Ma'.
Well, good luck with that.
Ask Mr. Samuel about the <cf>person called "Ma."
I think it's the person to whom my dad owes his inheritance. <cf>I don't know who that is, because I don't know.
Oh, hello there. Hey there, adventurer. <cf>What's wrong?
Oops. Mr. Vail asked me to <cf>to ask you about the old days?
Yeah, yeah. <cf>I know Mr. Vail's father.
You were a serious and disciplined person. <cf>We used to play together since we were kids.
Browse the stalls and go out into the desert for a bit. ......
I once almost got <cf>attacked by a monster outside of town. That scared the crap out of me.
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry. <cf>I was just talking about the old days.
I don't remember lending him anything, though. <cf>Did you leave a note at ...... 'Borrowed from Ma'?
Mar ...... Mar. Oh!　 <cf>That's what Mr. Manfredo used to call you.
Oh, and I remember you and Mr. Vail's father being very close <cf>.
I tend to forget what's going on these days, <cf>but I remember the old days well.
Why don't you pay Mr. Manfredo a visit?
Mr. Manfredo called me 'Ma.
You live in Salamzart, you should visit <cf>
Huh?　I lent something to Ms. Vail's father <cf>?
Unfortunately, I don't remember. ......
...... Hmm, no. <cf>If you ask me, yes!
My dad told Mr. Vail's place that <cf>["]Bapharia's estate is still owed ["].
My dad's name was Marty. <cf>He liked to collect odd things.
The nickname 'Ma' probably refers to my dad.
My father had already passed away. <cf>I forgot all about him.
I don't know what it's like, but <cf>if you can get it back, I hope you do.
Tell Mr. Vail.
'Borrowed from Mar' would be <cf>Bapharia's legacy that my dad loaned him.
I would appreciate it if you could return it to me. <cf>Please tell Mr. Vail.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>Did you find out anything about "On Loan from Mar"?
...... I see. <cf>You meant Mr. Manfredo's dad.
Of course, I'd like to pay you right back.
Apparently, the heritage doesn't seem to be working. <cf>They've been neglecting it for so long that it seems to have malfunctioned.
I did some research and found that it can be adjusted if you have a <cf>"high-pressure liquid tube" taken from <value type="enemyName" id="E003_05_00_02001"/>
It seems that you can get <cf>at ' <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>'
I am sorry if you broke it after borrowing it for a long time. <cf>It's only reasonable to return it to you after it's been properly repaired.
Sorry, can you go to ' <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>' and bring me <cf>'High Pressure Liquid Tubes'?
To repair Bapharia's legacy, get <cf>"High Pressure Liquid Tubes".
It should be taken from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E003_05_00_02001"/>at ' <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>'. Please.
Oh, thank you! <cf>I see you brought the "High Pressure Liquid Tubes."
Which, let's get on with repairing our heritage.
………………………………
...... Yeah, it seems to be working now. <cf>Good, good.
Could you please return this to Mr. Manfredo. <cf>I want you to tell him I'm sorry I left it on loan for so long.
Go give Mr. Manfredo his inheritance back.
Sorry I've been on loan for so long. <cf>I'd appreciate it if you could tell her that.
Oh, I see that Mr. Vail has entrusted <cf>Bapharia's legacy to you.
Hmmm. Yes, I did get it back. <cf>Thanks for your hard work.
So this is the legacy of Bapharia that my dad lent me. <cf>I wonder what it's all about?
'......, then ......, then ......, then ......, then ......, then .......'
Dad ......?　You're gonna hear my dad's voice.
Apparently, this legacy is one that can record <cf>the voice that spoke.
No, I miss it. I miss it. <cf>I'm not sure what you're talking about. ......
'...... fredo ...... cheerfully ......'
I now name the eagle ......
In the years leading up to ...... father's death, <cf>I was having a bit of a hard time coming to terms with it.
We barely even spoke to each other. ......
Still, maybe my dad did care about <cf>eagles.
I can honestly say I'm glad to hear this voice.
Thank you very much. <cf>You did what you asked of me.
Hopefully one day I'll be able to figure out what my dad was talking about <cf>
Hey, it's you. <cf>You made Mr. Manfredo happy.
Just hearing your late dad's voice <cf>makes me nostalgic and wonder, you know?
I can't hear my father's voice anymore. <cf>A little, I envy that man.
Like the ocean, like the sky. ...... <cf>My heart that expands as far as the eye can see. ......
Oh, it's just about to overflow! <cf>I wonder how big love can get!
There is no other happiness like this <cf>to see your guess on stage!　You know what I mean!
Huh ...... einar. <cf>What a sinful man he is......?
In the previous two plays, he played a priest who was straight-forward in his work and <cf>[repentance], while he was in forbidden love with a girl who visited him.
In the previous play, he lost his emotions and continued to speak to us as a young man who knew nothing of love <cf>with only his pure eyes ......
Can you imagine an audience that can tolerate a gap as large as this <cf>?
Yes, this is a sin!　If the world doesn't judge him, <cf>it's nothing short of a blunder by this world!
...... Huh, you're talking too much!
Einar is a promising young actor of the moment. <cf>I hope I have conveyed a little of his danger to you.
And ...... how I want my autograph.
I know!　You should be asking for these things yourself! <cf>All you have to do is look him straight in the eye and ask him for a word!
["]Mr. Einar, please sign me...["]. <cf>Straight ...... yes, straight ......
..................muri......... .........
I can't do it!　Of course I can't do it in person! <cf>If you do that, I'll die on the spot!
So please! <cf>Go and get it signed for me!
Please address it to "Dear Sabrina"!
Get an autograph from actor Einar!
I'll wait here. <cf>Because when I think of Einar, my legs are shaking and I can't move.
Ugh ...... I still can't do it. I can't do it! <cf>Can I really play this role?
...... what? <cf>Yeah, I'm the actor Einar. ......
You want my autograph?
Sorry ....... I can't sign right now. <cf>My hands are a little shaky.
It's a big show this time. <cf>I can't get over how nervous I am.
What if I forget my lines on stage?　What if the music stops? <cf>What if the stage set falls over?　What if my dad is in the audience?
No good. ......! <cf>I don't feel very calm!
How in the world do I ....... ......Yes. <cf>Hey, you, can you go get the ingredients for the cocoa?
I find sweet cocoa calms me down in a strange way.
I've been holding back because I can't rely on it forever. <cf>I wouldn't be able to make it to the stage this time without it!
Bring me the "Honey Cocoa Nuts"! <cf>You should be able to pick them up at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"
Bring me the <cf>"Honey Cocoa Nuts" that can be collected at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"!
Cocoa is all you need. <cf>I'll sign as many autographs as you want!
Ah, "Honey Cocoa Nuts"! <cf>You brought them, thank you!
I'll make a pot in a minute! <cf>I'll make you one, too. I'll get you one too.
...... wind. Ah, good sweetness. <cf>It's calming. ......
Okay, I'm starting to feel better. <cf>My head's starting to clear.
Oh no, I've shown you the embarrassing part.
I have a sweet tooth. <cf>Especially this cocoa I've been drinking for ages.
But you're selling a cool role and <cf>liking cocoa doesn't really fit the image, does it?
That's one of the reasons I've been trying to refrain from doing so lately.
Anyway, thanks for your help. <cf>Yes, I did. Do I need your signature?
Of course, I'll write to thank you. <cf>I'll even address it to you.
Yes, please. <cf>Deliver it to the client's admirer.
Sabrina, right? <cf>You should deliver my autograph to her.
I'd love it if you'd check out the <cf>stage if you'd like too.
Crikey! <cf>This, this is real, right?　Einar's signature!
Haha ...... I'm so happy. <cf>I'm so touched. Thank you!
But you, you smell kind of sweet, don't you? <cf>Like cocoa......
No way, I don't think so. ...... <cf>Cocoa with Einar at ......?
Yes, I did ask for your autograph! <cf>But you didn't ask me to have tea with you!
I hate you!　I hate you!　I'm so angry! <cf>More frankly, I'm really jealous!
What did you talk about at ......?
...... Einar drinks sweet cocoa before a performance? <cf>That cool, clear-eyed Einar?
Lies, that's not ...... such a thing! <cf>That's not ...... such a ...... thing!
<span size="Big">How wonderful oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! &lt;/&gt;
I can't believe he likes sweet cocoa when he's so cool! <cf>How many faces does he have!
I can no longer look directly at him on the next stage. ...... <cf>I'll be an Imagine if I see him: ......
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about this. <cf>No, I can't!
When the fans find out about this <cf>they will all go straight to the God of Bapharia!
A secret only for me and Einar. ...... <cf>Are you kidding me?　Too good to be true?　[Too good to die?
I want to say ...... I want to talk ....... <cf>I want to talk about Einar's secrets with my comrades. ......
But I can't talk about it all the time to protect everyone. <cf>This is an ordeal brought on by Einar. ......
Ya-moo! <cf>Stay-at-home, ah-kay-ta!
Why do I have to stay home alone? <cf>This is no fun at all!
My father is a painter.
I'm off to Litze right now, <cf>and I'm on a drawing binge.
They've forgotten about me anyway!
I'm praying to the Gods of Bapharia at <cf>that ["]my father is doing well."]
When I complained that he didn't come home all the time, I told him to <cf>["]come home properly ["]and he said, "I'm sorry, but I'm not coming home.
And now they start sneaking out in the morning!
I can't allow you to think that painting is more important than me! <cf>Tell him to come home and play with me!
Your father's name? <cf>Tregano!　He's a painter. Tregano.
Dad, I'm in Litze. <cf>Make sure you let me go home!
My father's name is Tregano. <cf>He's a painter in Litze.
It's so boring that I'm the only one left at home! <cf>Tell her to go home!
Oh, you are an adventurer. <cf>Are you also fascinated by the landscape of Litze?
I am a painter, my name is Tregano.
I came from <cf>Salamzart because I heard that the view of the mountains from this village is really wonderful!
Well, the view is even more spectacular than it sounds! <cf>My creative juices are flowing and I can't stop!
...... What, what? <cf>Have you Accepted Rowbell's request?
You want me to come home? <cf>You think the painting is more important than my daughter?
Ugh, Rowbell did that ......
Once I finish the painting I'm working on, <cf>I'll be on my way home soon!　But ......
Unfortunately, I ran out of white paint. <cf>I'm having new ones made.
I'm asking Mr. Detlef, the craftsman, to do it for me. <cf>But it's late, even for Mr. Detlef.
I was just telling you that we will wait patiently. ......
Okay, I'm going to go home as soon as I finish this painting. <cf>Let's go home as soon as this painting is finished.
Could you please go to Mr. Detlef's place <cf>and pick up the paints.
Could you please go to Mr. Detlef's place <cf>and pick up some white paint.
I'm a painter in Litze. <cf>I'll keep a little painting going.
Oh, welcome. You want some paints? <cf>I'm Detlef, the paint man.
Oh wow, you ordered Toregano. <cf>White paint. Sorry you had to come all the way out here.
Actually, I ran out of ingredients and can't make it.
What I make is not just a white color. <cf>I use mineral engrams to create a special coloration.
We use a stone called "Polarizing Stone". <cf>It deflects the light and makes it possible to create a perfect fill.
But then the <cf>Mooks started hanging around the mining site.
Do you need it urgently? <cf>Then why don't you do me a favor?
I need you to go to Litze Great Cave and collect "Polarized Stone".
If you have that, I can make the paints in no time. <cf>Sorry for the hassle, but I'm counting on you.
If you get it to me, <cf>I can make you some paint right away. I'm counting on you.
Oh, "Polarized Stone". <cf>Thanks for collecting them.
The other concoctions are already done. <cf>I'll crush and mix this one last time at ......
Yes, that's it!　The white paint you wanted. Here you go.
By the way, why did you, an adventurer, come to <cf>for paints?
...... Huh?　You son of a bitch Tregano. <cf>He left his daughter alone, didn't he?
This is no time for painting.
Tell Tregano. <cf>I'll sell you the paints as promised.
In exchange, <cf>you get it, you go home to your daughter with your feet!　I know.
If you can't do that, I'll never sell you paint again!
Tregano is still in Litze, right? <cf>Deliver him some white paint.
And when you receive it, get the hell home! <cf>Tell them that.
Oh!　I see you brought Mr. Detlef's paints to <cf>
Thanks. Now I can finish the painting.
Hmm ......?　Mr. Detlef wants you to ["]go home right away["]? <cf>Or else I'll never sell you paint again!
Ugh. How harsh. ......
No, but Mr. Detlef is right. <cf>I shouldn't have left my daughter alone.
Ok, I'll do the rest of the drawing. <cf>I'll draw the rest of the story when I get back to Salamzart.
I assume you are also going to report to Lobel? <cf>May I go with you?
Ah!　I'm finally home, Dad!
Lobel. I'm sorry. <cf>I'm totally late.
Don't paint anymore. Stay home all the time.
Well, thanks for that. <cf>It's what I do. It's what I like to do.
Then draw a picture of me.
Dad, all you do is landscapes. <cf>You haven't painted me, have you?
I'm a good drawer.
...... This is one for the taking. <cf>You're right. Let's get right on it.
Adventurer. <cf>Sorry for the inconvenience.
When it comes to painting, I get carried away. <cf>That's not good of me.
I'll pay you for it. <cf>The client is my daughter, but I should be able to make up that much.
Thanks to you, my dad is back! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
Dad, he's painting a picture of me.
He takes me to all kinds of places and <cf>if I stay still, he paints me a picture.
The trouble is that if I fall asleep in the middle of the picture, <cf>I fall asleep in the picture too!
Already!　Father and Mother <cf>why won't they forgive me?
I have a dream, too. <cf>I want to be an actress and perform on a glamorous stage!
But my father and mother are against it. <cf>No matter how much I tried to convince them, they wouldn't let me.
But you know what? The other day, my father finally said <cf>["]I'm going to give you an assignment and you're going to do it ["]and he said.
If we accomplish this, it means they'll recognize us!
It's just that it's a very difficult subject and <cf>I don't think I could do it alone.
So I decided to hire an adventurer. <cf> They didn't say, "["]You can't hire them["]," he said!
The challenge is to get the precious stones found in the desert.
Two "Sandflowers" and one <cf>"Leafstone"
Let's start by looking for the "Sandflower". <cf>They say you can find it at the Hermit's Fountain.
Let's go to the "Hermit's Fountain" then!
There it is! <cf>It's "Sandflower!
Sandflower" is a stone that was worn by <cf>divas at the Star Festival in the past.
It was so beautiful, and it stayed with all of us.
Since then, it's been famous as a <cf>good luck charm for girls who are going for something.
As it is, it looks like just a stone, but if you <cf>polish it patiently, it will turn a beautiful pink color.
One more thing, there should be a <cf>"Sandflower" at the "Khartoum Ruins".
Let's find out.
There it is. I found it! <cf>It's "Sandflower."
Now we have two sandflowers. <cf>Now we just need to find the "Leafstone".
Where is the "Leafstone" ......?
Oh, I just remembered!　Sometimes you can find them in the belly of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>'!
What a ......, Father! <cf>What a thing to get!
I can't fight <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>
Sorry, adventurer. Could you please go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>" and pick up <cf>"Leafstone"?
I'm going to slow you down. <cf>I'll go back to Salamzart first.
In the meantime, I'll polish up the "Sandflower".
Both "Sandflower" and "Leafstone" <cf>need to be polished by human hands to make them shine.
It takes patience, but I'm confident in that.
Leave the polishing to me. <cf>Adventurers, please take care of the reef stones!
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>You found the "Leafstone."
Thanks a lot. <cf>I'll polish it right up and show it to Father.
Wait and see, Father! <cf>I won't let you complain about this!
[--]I'm home! <cf>Hey, adventurer, listen up!
Father, you're a tease! <cf>He says things like this.
["]I knew you couldn't do it alone, but <cf>you thought to hire an adventurer ["].
[You did well this time, but this is only the first trial! <cf>But this is only the first test! ["]]
["]If we get through the second and third trials, <cf>I won't even think about it! ["]"]
To begin with, what would you do if I were fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>and <cf>directly?　I asked ......
[I've raised you to at least be able to judge <cf>whether or not you can fight," he said.
Do you believe my daughter or not? <cf>Which is it?
If they're so against it, maybe I should run away from home? <cf>I thought about it. ......
My dream is to <cf>be blessed by my family.
So, I'll do my best! <cf>I'm going to make sure I'm approved to be an actress!
Thank you so much for your help this time. <cf>Please help me to achieve my dream again!
Father and Mother aren't going to let me <cf>be an actress yet.
But now that we've completed this assignment, <cf>I feel like I'm looking at it a little differently.
I will never give up!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>There was a strange incident happening at the <cf>I've instructed my staff to investigate. ......
The results are not very encouraging. <cf>We've lost contact with them.
He is not the kind of subordinate who throws his job away. <cf>That's worrisome. ......
He seems concerned. <cf><value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>I'll let you know if I notice anything at
Someone's luggage is down.
The emblem of the Pioneer Bureau is painted on the bag. <cf>Looks like equipment for outdoor activities.
I'll go to the pioneer station and deliver it to the bureau.
...... hmm?　You. <cf>Sorry to be so blunt.
That bag ....... <cf>Maybe you picked it up at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>?
...... I knew it! <cf>That belongs to my man, Cecil.
She went to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>on a mission. <cf>Only her luggage was left behind or ......
You, I'm sorry to repeat myself. <cf>Would you be willing to take on my request?
Thank you. <cf>Let me explain the situation.
I'm working on a case right now.
We have recently observed <cf>a phenomenon of cemeteries being raided by someone or something in various parts of Asteria Plain.
Was it caused by a monster or by human hands? <cf>We're investigating that as well.
I sent my man Cecil to investigate the site, but <cf>there's a cloud over him.
That's why I asked for your help.
Cecile is a young man with a lot to offer. <cf>We decided that if we left it in her hands, there would be no problem.
But when I heard about the grave robbers, <cf>it bothered me that they looked somewhat thoughtful.
And there it is, the backpack you found for me.
Hi, I have a bad feeling about this ....... <cf>Sorry, but I need you to find her first.
Cecile should be headed to the 'garrison' at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>. <cf>I'd like you to go check on her.
Concerning the serial grave robbers <cf>I've ordered my man Cecil to investigate.
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>She should be headed to the 'garrison' of the <cf>I want you to go check on her.
Yes, I am. I'm looking into grave robbing <cf>Cecil is me.
...... at the request of Mr. Sisto <cf>to see how I'm doing?
Thank you for that. <cf>Mr. Sisto, I understand you were concerned.
I can't fight a fight, but <cf>I just ran out of here in a hurry. ......
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I did some research on the grave robbers. <cf>The culprits are a herd led by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>
We do not know the reason or purpose for raiding the tombs. <cf>No such ecology has been confirmed for goblins. ......
...... Actually, my grandma's grave was also raided by <cf>goblins!
When I went to visit the grave, the grave marker had fallen over. <cf>The ground had also been dug up.
I couldn't stand still when I heard Sisto's story <cf>......
And that's how I ended up here.
Mr. Adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>Can you please help us to defeat the
He's lurking in a nasty place and can be found at ....... <cf>You can find him at " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"
Once the herd is defiled, the tombs will no longer be razed. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>Defeat them, please!
Please use " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>" to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>
Then the herd will disperse and the <cf>grave robbers will be contained!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>Thank you very much for defeating the
The herd seems to have scattered. <cf>Now the graves will no longer be disturbed!
Grandma will surely sleep peacefully!
Speaking of which, while the adventurers were fighting <cf>I was checking out the area around the ransacked cemetery ......
Some of the goblin corpses had marks on them that looked like <cf>something was poked into them.
It looks like he poked her quite roughly and repeatedly. <cf>The scar is about the size of a <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>cane.
Is this also the work of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>......
It's kind of a little creepy. <cf>I'll have to report this to Mr. Sisto.
Excuse me, adventurer. <cf>Could you please come with me to Mr. Sisto?
You're safe, Cecil. <cf>Let's be happy about that first.
And you. <cf>Thank you for your help on such short notice.
Now then, let's hear your report on the grave robbers. <cf>What the hell happened, Cecil?
Actually ............
...... I see. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>and their herds have razed the tombs, and
And the herd was destroyed by you. <cf>I thank you again and again. You saved my life.
Cecil. I understand what happened. <cf>From now on, please be cautious.
I've been asked by <cf>your grandmother to make sure you don't get hurt.
Oh, ....... Yes, I understand. <cf>Sorry, Mr. Sisto.
Also, I'm curious about <cf>the strange traces left on the goblin's corpse.
The mark looks like something was violently prodded. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>Like a cane of ......
Yes, it is. <cf>This is just a theory: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>may have been performing <cf>some kind of ritual by piercing the corpse.
Goblin culture and thought is so enigmatic that <cf>I can't speak with any certainty.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>is a highly intelligent monster. <cf>It must have been one of the most unique individuals with unique values.
I think they were also raiding the tombs for <cf>bodies to make holes in.
It is difficult to verify, but I will record it as a reference. <cf>Thanks for your efforts, Cecil.
Yes, I am interested. Thank you.
You've been a great help. <cf>You've provided valuable information. Thank you.
Individual differences in monsters are not uncommon. <cf>They can sometimes be a factor in skewing the predictions of pioneering stations.
We intend to continue our investigation. <cf>We need your help again.
Cecil's on his way to restore a cemetery that's been vandalized.
He looked radiant. <cf>He seemed to have regained his natural cheerfulness.
You made it happen. Thank you.
We offer tea and coffee at <cf>
We also have some precious brands of imported wine. <cf>Please come and taste it!
Thank you for accepting my offer. <cf>Actually, our client forgot something.
We should be the ones to deliver it for you, but <cf>we're up and about and can't keep our hands off you.
Please send your handkerchief to <cf>
You forgot to mention our regular customer, Catherine.
She and three of her friends and their daughters were enjoying a tea party at <cf>our restaurant!
She is the daughter of a well-known merchant family in Asterleeds. <cf>I believe she is probably at home.
I look forward to working with you
Please send a handkerchief to your daughter, <cf>Catherine, who lives in Asterleeds!
We are out of our hands and would be happy to help you at ....... <cf>Sorry, but we appreciate your patience.
Well, how do you do? <cf>What can I do for you, Mr. Adventurer?
......Handkerchief you left at the store? <cf>I have a handkerchief?
...... is not mine!
This simple design is from Madeline's. <cf>I wonder where they replaced it?
Oh, by the way, at the tea party, <cf>I told you about my fiancé who gave me a handkerchief.
That's when you got it wrong.
Thanks for the delivery. <cf>And you.
Could you please return this replaced handkerchief to <cf>Madeline?
Madeline should be by the <cf>theater entrance on the way to the Bapharia temple.
She is a vocalist. <cf>She has a voice that is well known in Asterleeds.
Would you deliver a handkerchief to Madeline?
He should be by the entrance to the theater at <cf>on the way to the Temple of Bapharia.
Oh, my dear adventurer. <cf>Are you going to the opera?
What, to deliver me a handkerchief ......? <cf>No, sir, I have my own.
...... Oh?　This is not mine.
I seem to have made a mistake somewhere. <cf>Shame on me.
I see that this one that you brought is mine. <cf>Well, Catherine brought it to ......
Then you made a mistake at the tea party.
So this one I had is from <cf>Claudia?
The gold thread embroidery and the lingering scent of this perfume ....... <cf>I'm sure of it.
Catherine, Claudia and myself. <cf>The three of us were having a tea party at a café, so
I'm sorry to keep coming back. <cf>Could you please deliver this to Claudia?
She has just left for Salamzart.
I have a rehearsal for an opera. <cf>I am very sorry to trouble you.
Please, I would be grateful for your cooperation.
Please deliver the handkerchief to <cf>Claudia in Salamzart
I have a rehearsal for the revue from now on. <cf>Please take care of me.
Good day, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
Well, the handkerchief that was misplaced? <cf>You took the trouble to deliver it here.
Thank you very much. It's very helpful.
But ...... wonder. <cf>If it was my handkerchief, I would have put it here: ......
Oh my ......?　Oh dear, oh dear?
This is not one of my possessions. <cf>If you look closely, you can see the name of the store on it.
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. <cf>I think I brought a napkin from the store.
I'm pretty sure that what you delivered to me is <cf>my handkerchief.
This was hand-stitched by my mother. <cf>I really appreciate it.
Yes, I am. <cf>You are going back to the store, aren't you?
Could I please have this napkin back? <cf>I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you.
Please return the <cf>napkins to Paula's store in Asterleeds!
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I see that you were able to deliver the handkerchief to Catherine. <cf>Thank you very much.
Oh?　Isn't that a ...... <cf>napkin from this store?
I've been looking for it since a while ago. <cf>Why did you bring it?
...... Hmmm. I see. <cf>I met all three of you who had tea parties, and
No wonder you look tired too!
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you with the <cf>
However, all three of you took the wrong handkerchief, and <cf>I didn't realize that Lady Claudia would bring a store napkin.
Lady Claudia is a first-class violinist. <cf>Her playing is probably one of the best in the world.
But he is not good at anything else. <cf>He can show this bland side of himself!
Catherine and Madeline are also very similar. <cf>So it was a tea party for careless people.
We apologize for all the trouble we have caused you. <cf>Please take your time and visit us this time.
Since the incident with the handkerchief, the entire store staff has <cf>been on the lookout for forgotten items!
After all, <cf>is a cafe where careless people gather.
Calligraphy is an art. <cf>It is not just writing letters.
The will that is put into it. The feelings. The heart. <cf>These become one and are expressed in the letters of a word.
The destination of the brush shows the way. <cf>In other words, this is the heart of calligraphy.
I am a calligrapher. <cf>It is not very popular in this town yet.
Calligraphy is not about good or bad handwriting. <cf>It is about the heart and emotion that you put into it.
In other words, calligraphy is ....... Sorry. <cf>I had to talk about the commission.
Actually, you know. <cf>I'm getting old, and I'm looking for my successor.
Then my granddaughter, Lindsay, <cf>offered to take over for me.
Sure, thanks. Jaga: ......
I was wondering if you might have been <cf>pushing yourself too hard to care about me.
Does Lindsey really want to live as a calligrapher? <cf>I want to know her true feelings.
So I wrote a letter to her. <cf>Will you deliver this and go talk to him?
And if Lindsay has a problem, <cf>can you please fix it!
I know that there are things that are difficult for you to talk about with me present. <cf>Therefore, I would like to ask you to do so.
Please deliver the letter to Lindsay and listen to what she has to say. <cf>Please do me a favor.
Deliver a letter to my granddaughter, Lindsay, at <cf>and ask her to listen to me.
He is a scribe in Asterleeds. <cf>He works hard and is proud of his grandson.
What, a letter from Grandpa to me?
Wow, thank you. <cf>It's exciting to get a letter, isn't it?
Which is ....... <cf>Wow, your handwriting is as beautiful as ever.
My grandpa is a calligrapher. <cf>Hmmm...I see. So it's about his successor.
You're so clumsy, Grandpa. <cf>Why didn't you just ask me directly?
Don't worry. <cf>I mean it when I say I want to be a calligrapher.
A heartfelt letter moves the heart of the beholder. <cf>That's what my Grandpa Baphit taught me.
I'm a scribe for <cf>because I want to get something into the hearts of the people who read my letters.
So. <cf>I wanted to let people know more about calligraphy.
I was making these posters!　What do you think?
'Signs, posters, flyers <cf>I'll write anything cool!　Lindsey
If you put a sign or a poster in your store with the words "Dawn", it will be seen by a lot of people!　on a store sign or poster, <cf>would be seen by a lot of people, wouldn't it?
If it is cool or beautiful <cf>people might understand the greatness of calligraphy!
If you'd like, you can help me put up the posters at <cf>
A pillar in a shopping street, or in front of a pioneering bureau. <cf>The entrance to Asterleeds would be very noticeable too.
I need you to find a place like that and go to <cf>and put up a poster.
Thanks for your time! <cf>Come back when you're done putting it all up.
Go put up posters in prominent places around town.
Maybe a shopping street, or in front of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I also think the town gate square would be nice.
I put up the posters Lindsay gave me.
A passerby seemed interested. <cf>[I wonder what kind of writing he does ["]"], he said.
The adventurers are interested. <cf>["]Maybe we should write it on the team's flag ["]and talk about it.
Finished putting up all the posters.
Oh?　What's this poster? <cf>I'll write anything cool!" ......?
Wow, sounds interesting, doesn't it? <cf>Hey, you, come on over and talk to me.
I am Lysander. I am the fastest man in the world!
My carriage is soooo fast, but <cf>the speed hasn't kept up with the coolness.
I thought it would be cool to put a flag on it to give it a speedy <cf>feel.
But I ain't a painter and I can't write. <cf>So that's a white flag?　That's not cool.
And here's your poster!
Someone who writes about everything in a cool way? <cf>That's great!
Can you take me to him?
Take me to <cf>, the guy who writes cool stuff about everything.
You say your name is Lindsay? <cf>Okay, let's go!
Ah, adventurer. Welcome back! <cf>I see you've been putting up posters.
I don't know. <cf>I guess Grandpa came too after all.
Thanks for delivering the letter. <cf>You did my grandson a favor.
I found Lindsay's name on a poster you had and came to <cf>out of curiosity.
I said I'm fine with the succession. <cf>...... Huh?　Adventurer, who's that over there?
Oh, I'm Lysander!
You're the one who writes all the cool stuff at <cf>?　I need a favor.
Oh!　You got a visitor right away!
What do you want to start with, Lindsay?
To let everyone know how great calligraphy is, <cf>I write cool letters on posters, billboards, and flyers.
I've always wanted to try it. <cf>Because your grandfather's calligraphy is amazing!
I don't know much about calligraphy. <cf>Can you write cool letters too, old man?
Yes, it is. Grandpa's handwriting is <cf>very beautiful and cool!
That's great! <cf>Then you can write with me, old man!
What I want is a flag to put on the wagon! <cf>I want a really cool one.
Because I'm going to go around bragging to all the guests I give rides to! <cf>[Have you ever seen such cool handwriting? ["]
That way, people will learn about calligraphy.
......I know what I'm talking about. I will definitely let you do it. <cf>Never thought I'd see the day.
Got it!　Mr. Lysander, I'll take care of it. <cf>We'll both write the coolest letters!
You are an adventurer. Lindsay and I are indebted to you. <cf>I am truly sorry.
Knowing my grandson's heart, the eagle is also on fire. <cf>I will write this bafite with all my heart and soul.
I got a great job, which is rare in my long life. <cf>Most importantly, I got to know Lindsay's true intentions.
It's all thanks to you. <cf>Thank you.
It's been a while since I've been back home ....... <cf>This great detective's nose can smell the case!
The case is great, but why don't we show up at the <cf>mansion?　Sir.
You have come to the right place, my assistant!
Join me, the great detective Guido, here at <cf>to solve the mystery of the "Night Wagon Attack"!
Sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Adventurer.
Assistant or not, <cf>please keep your detective-minded husband company!
The client in this case is a certain big business association with <cf>
A wagon was driving down a street at night when <cf>it was suddenly attacked by someone or something. ......
If you are dealing with thugs, your husband is a piece of cake. <cf>Please protect him.
Hahaha! <cf>How can I be defeated by a tyrant?
In spite of this, I used to complete the participation prizes in the <cf>children's tournament at Arena in Asterleeds!
Everything is going as it should. <cf>We have no choice but to ask our adventurers to do the heavy lifting.
Now, let's start the investigation! <cf>First, let's hear more details from the victim of the crime.
You are a lady by the name of Catherine. <cf>She lives in Asterleeds. Here we go!
Dear Catherine, ....... <cf>We have the same name, but it's a coincidence. ......
You must be my client, Ms. Catherine! <cf>The great detective Guido is here to talk to you!
Oh, please wait! <cf>Was it really Ms. Catherine who was the client!
Hohohoho!　I see you in unexpected places. <cf>It's been two years, Cindy?
Hi, it's been a while: ......
Oh, did you two know each other?
...... Are you serious? <cf>Don't tell me you are forgetting about me?
No, sir, I don't believe so! <cf>Isn't that right, sir?
Huh?　I don't know what you're talking about.
And anyway, about the incident! <cf>Can you describe the perpetrators who attacked the wagons?
...... Well, all right. <cf>We'll talk privately later.
Please listen to me, adventurer. <cf>Actually, it was too dark to see the culprit.
But the murderer is a man of terrible and monstrous strength. <cf>The whole wagon was pushed over.
Wow, a whole carriage. ...... <cf>That must have been a terrible experience.
I'm more angry now <cf>than horrified, though, right?
Anyway, I've left it to you. <cf>Let's see how good a detective you are.
For some reason, the client seems to be glaring at me: ....... <cf>Did I do something rude?
Anyway, the next step is to investigate the streets at night. <cf>I'll let the officials talk to you.
I will leave it to you to interview people in town. <cf>When you gather information, please let me know.
Please talk to people in town at <cf>about incidents that have happened on the street.
If you are a peddler or adventurer, you must use the streets a lot. <cf>You feel like you have information!
Wagons were attacked on the street at night?
If that's what you're talking about, I have an idea of what you're talking about. <cf>I've been in a similar situation myself.
I was driving the carriage and <cf>suddenly a big shadow appeared in front of me.
We almost had a collision.
I think it was much bigger than a human being. <cf>I'm sorry, but I was so surprised that I ran away. ......
I don't really know who they are. Sorry.
Wagons attacked on the street at night?
Hmmm ....... I don't know if this has anything to do with that story, but I've had some weird experiences with <cf>
I once came across <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>standing in front of a group of people on a street at night!
Of course I went in to help. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>I thought I was being attacked by a
But as soon as they did, both <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>and the humans ran away!
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>Aside from the <cf>Why did even those people run away?
In the end, no one stayed there, so <cf>we'll never know what happened.
So, sir. <cf>I think you should show up at the mansion once in a while. ......
Hahaha!　I'm busy too. <cf>I don't have time to go back to the mansion.
You said that and you haven't been back for two years! <cf>That's why you didn't even mention Lady Catherine [--].
Oh, assistant. Welcome back. <cf>Have you gathered any information about the night streets?
Let's get right to the story!
Oh, this might be a bust: ......
Hoho, I see. ...... <cf>Shadows bigger than people, strange groups and <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>......
Phew. <cf>I've solved the mystery of this case!
The culprit is, as it should be, a legendary demi-god [--] sealed away from time immemorial!
That sounds like it might have something to do with the <cf>bandit story we heard.
It is said that the bandits hiding in " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" have recently joined forces with <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>The plan is to have the wagons attacked by the <cf>bandits, and then the bandits will take the cargo.
......................... <cf>Good point, Cindy!
It is outrageous that humans and <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>are teaming up! <cf>This is a terrible threat to Asterleeds!
You go and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>ASAP. <cf>I'll figure out how to deal with the bandits.
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>Once they are gone, <cf>there will be nothing left for the bandits to do!
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>Defeat, I asked!
Excuse me, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Could you please let me know when you are done defeating them?
Perhaps your husband will <cf>be too much for that. ......
Please use " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>
Leave the bandits alone. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>Once the bandits are defeated, there is nothing more you can do!
Please let me know when you have finished defeating the problem. <cf>Best regards
Ah, you have defeated <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Good job, adventurer!
As for the bandits, we have had the patrols strengthened. <cf>I think we should be good to go now.
So, your husband is, you know, ....... <cf>I've been a little busy.
You seriously don't realize!　Guido!
I am your fiancée, Catherine!
Oh my!　You are my darling Catherine!
Ha ha ha!　You look different. <cf>You've become a fine lady.
This, silly! <cf>You should have realized this at the request stage!
I can't imagine forgetting my fiancée's face! <cf>Please say a word to him, adventurer-sama!
As you can see, the two of you are engaged to be married!
And yet, we have not seen him for two years. <cf>Because of the Master's not returning to the mansion, ......
She didn't contact us and even forgot our faces. <cf>Catherine was furious ......
I asked for you because I heard your name and <cf>didn't even pretend to recall it!
What do you mean? <cf>I remembered your name too!
If you forget that much, the engagement is off!
...... This is not going to stop for the time being. <cf>Dear Adventurers. Here's your reward.
Please take it back before you get involved. <cf>Thank you so much for your cooperation!
Now, what will be the next case? <cf>The mystery is calling me.
It's me who's calling you! <cf>Turn around, Guido!
Sir, please, please apologize! <cf>It will make it all stop!
Welcome to the "Rector's Big Bookcase". <cf>Here you can also borrow books!
I'll ask you to return it by the due date.
Some books don't come back easily.
This "Rector's Big Bookcase" also offers <cf>some books for loan!
We assume that you will return the books on time. <cf>Sometimes there are books that are not returned.
This is one of those times. <cf>Please tell them to return the book as soon as possible.
The lender is a boy named Yuska.
The book is called "The Keon Adventures". <cf>I read it over and over as a child.
It is an adventure novel in which the main character, the adventurer Keon, bravely and intelligently explores <cf>numerous ruins!
Keon is really cool and nice! <cf>My first love is also him ......!
Gohon, gohon! <cf>No, no, no, no, no!　Forget it!
Let's see, we were talking about Mr. Yuska, weren't we?
He loved books and came here often. <cf>He never missed a lending deadline.
I can't seem to make friends. <cf>I was a little worried there.
Can you help me find Mr. Yuska? <cf>I don't know where he is. ......
Ask your classmates at school. <cf>They will tell you where to find them.
Ask Yuska's classmates at <cf>where he is.
I don't know where else to play but here: <cf>I think I know kids your age!
Yuska? <cf>Oh, you're the new transfer student who recently joined us.
He's reading all the time, so <cf>it's kind of hard to talk to him.
He goes home right after school too. ...... <cf>I don't know where he hangs out either.
Ah, but. <cf>They were arguing about something the other day.
You see that big bridge at the entrance to the city? <cf>You go over that bridge or not.
Of course, kids aren't allowed to go there.
Yuska was peeled off ["]I'm going to go! ["] <cf>She was yelling.
No, I think you're joking anyway, man. <cf>There's a monster out there on the other side of the bridge.
What's that Yuska guy thinking?
The guy in Yuska said something about ["]going over the bridge["] or <cf>
It's not safe because there will be monsters, too. <cf>What are they thinking?
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Yes, I'm Yuska. Yuska is me, but...
...... Isial asked you to return the book? <cf>Oh, I totally forgot ......
It's the "Keon Adventures", right? <cf>Yes, I have it here.
I read this story and got hooked. <cf>I thought adventurers were awesome and cool.
So ...... I decided to imitate <cf>and go to the ruins of Bapharia.
You shouldn't cross the bridge alone, but ......
I thought if I could do that, everyone at school would <cf>recognize me a little better. ......
That's not going to happen, is it? <cf>Coming here has given me a head cold.
I'm sorry. I'm going home. <cf>I have to return the book to Mr. Isial and apologize to him.
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Could you take me to the Pioneer Station?
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I see you brought Mr. Yuska with you.
......Ehhh! <cf>Yuska, you were on the other side of the bridge all by yourself!
Why did you do that? <cf>It would be dangerous!
I'm sorry. <cf>But I read about it in "The Keon Adventures".
Being an adventurer is not a profession. <cf>　Anyone with a sense of adventure is an adventurer.
And the qualities of an adventurer are not brawn or wisdom."
A heart that believes in itself and draws out its own strength, which it does not even know it has. <cf>　In other words, courage.
I wanted to prove that I was brave.
Yes, there is that passage. <cf>But, Yuska. Your actions are not a sign of courage.
It is only those who are brave enough to admit failure."
'Let the bitter memories be engraved in our hearts and let them be the steps we take tomorrow. <cf>　We must not forget the courage to accept our mistakes.
'He dies like a beast, without regard for his own failures. <cf>　It is one of the most foolish dishonors.
Do you think Keon has the courage to justify himself <cf>while doing something that would cause someone else to worry?
Well, that's ......
You're not reading that well enough, boy.
Yeah ....... I was wrong. <cf>Sorry, Isial.
I just need to know. <cf>Don't be reckless again.
Yuska, you were safe and your book has been returned. <cf>Thank you, adventurer.
I know very well that he is not a bad boy. <cf>I intend to watch him more closely than ever.
I am glad I asked for an adventurer. <cf>It's people like you that children will look up to!
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your help with Mr. Yuska.
Yuska has been remorseful since then, too. <cf>He's made some friends just because he showed some guts.
They came to the archives a little less often. <cf>I'm sure this was for the best!
Hmmm, a beautiful stone no matter how many times I see it: ......
I knew I was right. <cf>You, too, should choose well when buying jewelry.
Lately, <cf>around here, <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>has been popping up all of a sudden.
I'm trying to get rid of them, but they only show up when <cf>I'm watching the fields.
This has never happened before. <cf>So I would like you to find out the cause.
Can you first take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"?
We need to stay away from the fields first. <cf>Best regards.
Take down <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>" and stay away from <cf>my field.
Oh, it's you! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>You took down the
I appreciate that. <cf>But at the same time we had a problem.
I just bought a gem the other day and <cf>it suddenly lost its light!
Here it is. <cf>It's a beautiful red gem, and I've always admired it.
It was shining just a few moments ago. ......
...... wait. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>appeared after I bought this gem.
And the gems lost their shine <cf>right after you took down <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>......
Perhaps this gem has something to do with <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>?
Could you please go to <cf>and talk to the adventurer who sold this gem to me?
She's a female adventurer named Durga. <cf>She should be in this town, so look for her.
He sold me a red gem <cf>Look for a female adventurer named Durga.
They should be somewhere in Salamzart. <cf>If he's an adventurer, maybe near the Pioneer Station.
Is that the red gem that Mr. Manfredo has? <cf>Yeah, I sold them to him.
What?　 <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>You mean to tell me that <cf>appeared, or that the gem light went out when I took down the guy?
Is that what happened? <cf>I found that gemstone in the ruins.
I thought it was beautiful and priceless. <cf>Mr. Manfredo bought it for me.
...... wait a minute. <cf>You said <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>suddenly started showing up?
I also had some monster attacks a while back <cf>
But it's ok now. <cf>...... yeah. Since about the time I gave away that red gem.
Don't tell me the red gem is attracting <cf>monsters?
If so, we're in trouble! <cf>This guy needs to be looked into properly.
I'm sure the Asterleeds pioneer station might be able to find some resources at <cf>.
I'll help too. <cf>Let's go to Asterleeds.
Did you find anything on the red gem?
Oh, this book. Which one? ......
'Once there was a cursed five-colored gem.
The red gem has the power to attract <cf>demons around the person who holds it."
'When the power of the curse is unleashed, <cf>the jewel shines strong.'
'When the plague of curses is repelled, <cf>the jewel loses its brilliance.'
'But the power of the curse remains, and <cf>the gems begin to shine again ......'
You said Mr. Manfredo's jewelry stopped glowing <cf>?
If that's this cursed gem, <cf>it will shine again, won't it?
Then again, the <cf>monster might appear at Mr. Manfredo's place!
This is not good! <cf>Let's go back to Salamzart immediately!
Oh!　It's you! <cf>And Durga's with you.
Listen up! <cf>The red gems are starting to shine again!
Overlapping it, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>also appeared!
I knew it! <cf>Mr. Manfredo. It's a cursed gem.
When it shines it attracts monsters and when <cf>it is defeated it loses its shine
But the power of the curse won't go away, so <cf>when it starts shining again, the monsters will appear.
What a thing they sold me!
I didn't know! <cf>I'm sorry. That's why I'm here.
Anyway, first things first: <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>. <cf>We can't even talk to them until we get rid of them.
It's ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>', right? <cf>Let's get this over with.
Thanks again. Go take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>".
But still, I never thought such a beautiful gem <cf>would be cursed ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>I'm glad you got rid of the "Mere Old Man". <cf>I thank you for that. Thank you.
But the red gem has <cf>lost its shine again. ......
Hey, Mr. Manfredo. <cf>I'll give you your money back, but you'd better let go of that jewelry.
It's a jewel that can curse its owner.
I can't leave it with someone else either. <cf>How about having the Pioneer Bureau take care of it?
Ummm, but ....... You don't find such beautiful gems <cf>very often!
Is there any way to break the curse?
There might be, but we don't know yet.
Jewelry is beautiful. <cf>But your life is more important, isn't it?
Ummmmmmmmm ......
...... You guys are right. It can't be helped. <cf>I'll let go of the jewelry, though I'm sorry to leave it behind.
I'm the one who asked you to find out the cause of the problem. <cf>Well, I appreciate that.
I'll take the jewelry to the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I've caused you a lot of trouble with my mismanagement.
Thanks to you, we were able to stop the damage from the curse. <cf>I thank you, too. Thank you.
Oh, boy! <cf>Have you broken the curse of that red jewel?
Be the first to tell me when the curse is lifted. <cf>I'll buy you out, no matter how much it costs!
Oh no!　It was my precious toy! <cf>I'm going to get it back!
I'm in trouble, aren't I? <cf>I'll buy you another one, okay?
Hey, you're the adventurer, right? <cf>Help me!
I was playing with a pineapple and another pineapple took <cf>a toy from me and the pineapple!
I'm sorry for the sudden appearance, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>You look like you have no idea what's going on.
Do you know a monster called <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>?
Talk about looking like a pineapple. <cf>Two types of pineapples are commonly seen: green and purple.
The green one is adorable and <cf>everyone likes her.
Graffiti on walls, <cf>popping up from the shadows to surprise people, ......
Just like my kids. <cf>My kid is friends with the green <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>too.
That's right. We were playing together. <cf>Then he took my toy!
It's purple that's bad. <cf>Purple pineapple!
The purple one is <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Unlike the green one, she's a little tougher.
They block roads to make them impassable, <cf>destroy vegetables in the fields, ......
If it's bad enough, they can hurt you. <cf>I can't let them near my kids.
Please, punish the purple pineapple! <cf>I'll be disappointed if I don't get punished!
I see the purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>'. <cf>Give her a little spanking.
Punish the purple pineapple! <cf>It's not green!
I hear the purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>is ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>' and I see <cf>a lot.
Ah!　Adventurers!
You've punished me for my purple pineapple <cf>!
Purple came to apologize to me just now. <cf>I forgave her because she was so sorry.
I got my toys back too. <cf>I'm glad it wasn't broken because I took good care of it!
I can't believe you came to apologize properly, <cf>purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>has a disciplined side too.
I'm glad he's feeling remorse.
Adventurer. <cf>Thank you very much.
<value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>If you see <cf>please don't tease him too much!
I'm going to play with <cf>Pineapple at a nearby plaza next time I'm there!
Oliver and <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>are both fine and <cf>getting sloshed!
It's hard <cf>to bathe them together. ugh...
Oh no, I'm screwed. <cf>I spoke out of turn in front of my son again.
Show me the ["]evidence ["] <cf>What if they say ......
I'm sorry to bother you and your colleagues. <cf>I just need a little help.
I had to collect a lot of medicinal herbs <cf>for a reason.
It's a medicinal herb called <cf>"yellow cotton grass" that can be found at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>in Asteria Plain.
It's going to take <cf>quite a bit of time to get all these numbers together.
I said to my son, "Dad, you'll have it all in no time!" I told my son at <cf>
Please. <cf>Please help me collect "yellow cotton grass" even if it's only half!
My son dreams of being an adventurer.
Maybe that's part of the reason why he looked at me, the adventurer, <cf>with such a twinkle in his eye.
So I got all glammed up and went to ......
For the sake of my dignity as a father ...... No. <cf>Please don't destroy my son's dreams!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" in Asteria Plain and collect <cf>"[yellow cotton grass]".
You collected "yellow cotton grass" for me. <cf>Thank you.
You're a good guy. <cf>For helping me out like this.
So I'll tell you the truth.
Actually, this is a medicinal herb that I need <cf>to treat my son.
My son has a nasty disease. <cf>Maybe that's why he longs to be an adventurer.
I'm not a great adventurer, <cf>so I wanted to at least reassure my son.
So, ....... <cf>Have you ever heard of "Dogorman's Hidden Fangs"?
It's an unusual tusk that grows in a position not visible from the outside, <cf>from <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>that lives in " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>".
Yellow cotton grass" is a medicinal herb to suppress symptoms, you know. <cf>To cure my son's illness, I need a medicine made from an infusion of this tusk.
["]Someday, I'm sure your father will get it ["] <cf>I've told my son.
But I can't get <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>with my skills. <cf>I don't know when I'll get it.
I humbly ask you! <cf>Go get me the "Hidden Fangs of Dogorman"!
I don't care about my dignity anymore! <cf>I just want to cure my son's illness as soon as possible!
I can trust you with my life. <cf>Please, please, please!
Get <cf>"Dogorman's Hidden Fangs" from <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>that dwells in " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>".
I need it to cure my son's disease. <cf>Please, please, please!
This ...... this is "Dogorman's Hidden Fang"?
Thank you ...... thank you so much! <cf>I can't thank you enough no matter how much I appreciate it.
This will cure my son's illness. <cf>You are my benefactor.
But still, I'm really pathetic. <cf>I shouldn't have been so vain.
For my son's sake, <cf>I'm going to be the adventurer he really aspires to be.
A fine adventurer like you.
I met the best role model. <cf>I will never forget this favor!
Anta. <cf>My son is getting better and better.
I told him about you, too. <cf>He said he'd like to meet you someday when he becomes an adventurer.
I'll look forward to working with you then!
The books don't add up. ...... <cf>Anne, you wasted money again, didn't you?
Not in vain!　An investment in new product development! <cf>I'm sure it will sell this time!
Huh ...... not at all. <cf>I'll have to cut back this month too......
Hello! <cf>We're just peddling our original goods.
I'm an inventor and a merchant. <cf>I have lots of ideas!
Yes, I know. If it's 'just' an idea, <cf>I've got plenty to sell.
Now, let me introduce today's new product!
There is amber, right? <cf>I want to make something that looks like it.
Sparkly accessories are always popular at <cf>, right?
<cf>[I can't afford to buy real amber!
We have handmade accessories that resemble amber! <cf>Looks just like amber!　Reasonably priced!
Sold to ladies, it became popular and went viral all over the world! <cf>Hmmm, good idea!
I've never successfully developed <cf>before selling it, though.
Don't worry, this time! <cf>If this works, I can live playing every day!
You always say that.
But this doesn't seem to have enough impact or <cf>be one-of-a-kind.
Our goal is <cf>to be the number one and only product!
Just Anne.
Damn, Shea is so flippant.
Anyway, I thought about what was missing!
Speaking of amber?　Yes, bugs! <cf>I want to make amber jewelry with bugs in it!
So, may I ask for <cf>?
Insect Fortress of Insect Fortress" has a lot of insects. <cf>If you can collect a few of them at random, ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>I'd like to see the　Go to ' <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>' and collect <cf>'brightly colored insect shells'!
Huh?　Wait. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>is indeed too much to ask. ......
It's a number one, one-of-a-kind product. <cf>No compromises!　Right?
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>from "Colorful insect shells"! <cf>Best regards!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>and collect <cf>"colorful insect shells"!
Excuse me. <cf>Anne will take care of this. Anne.
It's a 'brightly colored insect shell.'　Thank you! <cf>I knew you would do it!
Alright. Now all we need to do is put this in a stone that <cf>imitates amber. ...... Huh?
Well ....... <cf>I can't wait to see how you plan to put it in!
The <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>is <cf>much bigger than the stone you prepared!
That's why I said it's impossible.
Wait ...... wait ....... <cf>I managed to screw it up by forcing ......
Hah ....... Adventurer. Thank you for listening to Anne's selfishness <cf>
I'll let you know when the new product is ready.
Well, it's all Anne's idea, so <cf>it'll be old age before it comes true.
Hey, Shea! <cf>Don't be so carefree and help me!
Hmmm... ......! <cf>I think I can push it a little more ......
That ......?　Something <span size="Big">weird juice&lt;/&gt; is coming out.
Hey!　That's poison! <cf>It's dangerous, so go wash your hands quickly!
Ow!　Get your hands away from me! <cf>It's really dangerous!　I mean, don't play with it!
What does it taste like? <cf>Do you think this will sell?
Why are you trying to lick it! <cf>Anne!　Let go of my hand!
<span size="Big">Stop ...... Stop it! &lt;/&gt;
Inspiration!　 <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>to a blender and grind it into <cf>amber!
Please really don't do this! <cf>Come to your senses Anne!　Stop ...... Stop it!
No way, was the sighting at <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>?
It should not be native to Asteria Plain. <cf>Why here: ......
I'm in Asteria Plain <cf>studying the ecology of flora and fauna.
I heard something curious the other day. <cf> There was an adventurer named ["] who saw ["] <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>is a big bug-shaped monster.
They are carnivorous and ferocious. <cf>They attack humans with impunity.
It is not originally found in Asteria Plain. <cf>But there have been multiple sightings.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>If the "Mere Old Man" is able to breed, we will be in big trouble. <cf>Before that happens, we have to defeat them and reduce their numbers!
I appealed to the higher-ups at the pioneering bureau to do so, but they rejected my appeal.
Not sure if he's there <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>, but <cf>says the priority is to take down Mook, who has gone berserk lately.
Because the damage caused by Mooks in the Montegnor Valley <cf>has been increasing in recent days.
But that's why we need to address <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>!
Mook's violent behavior is probably due to the <cf>probably due to the <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>outbreak.
Mook and the others are in high spirits because of the attack. <cf>No matter how many Mooks we take down, the situation will never end.
I want to prove that and convince the pioneer bureau. <cf>Now, I think <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>is the one to take down.
So I need you to go and investigate <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in Montegnor Valley.
You should be able to find <cf>"Kagachiyanma egg masses" within Mook's range of action.
They lay eggs near their prey's nests. <cf>That's <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>'s habit.
We don't have much time. <cf>I'll put together the documents. Thanks for your help.
Find <cf>"Kagatiyanma egg masses" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in Montegnor Valley.
Mook and his team are getting worked up because of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>. I can attest to that.
I found a "Kagachiyamma egg mass.
Let's bring it back to Asterleeds and report back to <cf>Andrew.
Have you found the "Kagatiyanma egg masses"?
Searching for new spawning grounds <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>and <cf>Mooks are killing to protect their territory ......
It's evidence of a conflict between the two sides. <cf>I am still sure. It's caused by <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>
Thank you. Now the pioneering bureau will work on the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>countermeasure.
I'm going to go ask upper management to exterminate the egg masses.
In the meantime, I need you to take down the already adult <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>
Do you know about the 'Boroum Ruins'? <cf>We've been getting reports of a lot of noise in the back there lately.
There is a spawning site at <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>near there. <cf>It's probably the center of this big spawning run.
If we take steps here, <cf>we can end the damage before it happens.
Go to ' <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>' and take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>!
This should keep them from reproducing. <cf>I'm counting on you!
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>You took down the
It was a dangerous job, but you did it well! <cf>Thanks to you, it worked.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>The area of activity of the <cf>Mooks is narrowing and the Mooks are getting restless.
You've been very cooperative with us. <cf>You've made upper management understand.
The pioneering bureau is going to take the lead in monitoring <cf>for a while.
I thank you. <cf>If you ever need anything else, I'd love to help you out.
It's another calm day in Asteria Plain.
I don't see any ecological anomalies. <cf>I hope days like this continue.
Oh, it's not enough! <cf>This just doesn't fill my heart.
How can I make that beauty <cf>my own?
Hah ....... <cf>Beautiful. Bugs: ......
Are you interested in insects, Mr. Adventurer?
Bugs are great. ...... <cf>I, for one, am fascinated by their beauty.
A unique sparkle that is different from that of gemstones. <cf>It is as if a rainbow were reflected on its body.
Oh, I'm not the only one who thinks so <cf>?
Have you ever seen them in a museum? <cf>Old artifacts decorated with insect wings and shells.
They used to use the beauty of insects to create <cf>works of art!
I was so moved when I saw it as a child.
I've been collecting bugs like crazy ever since. <cf>You get the idea, right?
But ...... my heart is not satisfied
A sweet and sour haze similar to that of love <cf>appeals to me from deep within my heart.
I haven't got enough ......! <cf>The supreme sparkle is not in my hands. ......
The Sparkle of Supremacy: ...... Yes. <cf>These are the insects that are feared as monsters!
I love bugs, but <cf>they are indeed dangerous and I can't touch them!
It is one thing to be in the hands of a loved one. <cf>But you can't love a bug if it's dead.
So wait until it's time to bring the curtain down on life <cf>
Dear Adventurer. Could you please collect "Specimens of Miin" and <cf>"Specimens of Kagachiyanma"?
Please fill my room and my heart with a sparkle I have never touched <cf>
We ask for a large number. <cf>We want to carefully select the most beautiful specimens.
I think you can find <cf>at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" in Montegnor Valley.
Would you please collect "Specimens of Miin" and "Specimens of Kagachiyanma" at <cf>
You collected "Specimens of Miin" and "Specimens of Kagachiyanma" at <cf>
Oh, thank you. <cf>Beautiful ...... what a beautiful ......!
It's like stained glass decorating a royal palace. <cf>Now I am a princess in a castle of bugs ......!
Any good architect in the world couldn't build a more beautiful castle <cf>
And the graceful curves of the shell
It's like a meteor soaring in the sky: ....... <cf>I can't believe such flowing curves exist in this world!
Do you understand? <cf>Of course you do, don't you?
You know what I mean. <cf>Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to collect all these magnificent bugs.
Excellent work, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I am moved to tears.
This meeting is a miracle! <cf>The bugs brought me and you together.
Dear Adventurer. <cf>Do me one more favor.
The insect I have long been in love with....... <cf>I want to see that bug that I had almost given up on ......!
It is <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>
It has grown to maturity without exposure to the sun <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>. <cf>Its shell holds the sparkle of the unknown.
It's a dangerous place, but I'm sure <cf>adventurers will be able to help you ......!
We can only ask adventurers. <cf>Please send "Venomine Specimens" to ......!
Get the <cf>"Venomine Specimen" from <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>"
I've been pining for that bug for a long time <cf>and I really want to see it. ......
Here, this is ......! <cf>The Venomine Specimen, ......!
Oh, oh ......! <cf>What a variety of ......!
It is like a night sky full of stars.
I can't believe that because they grew up without sunlight, <cf>they get the beauty of an endless starry sky. ......
This is a miracle. <cf>I am already a slave to the beauty ...... that <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>radiates!
You understand, don't you? <cf>Don't tell me you don't understand?
What a feeling of contentment! <cf>My heart was moistened like an oasis in the desert.
Thank you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>You are the next best thing to a bug, and the one I adore.
Whenever my heart has a new thirst <cf>I'll ask the adventurers again!
Haha. ......!
Perhaps the adventurers will find ...... <cf>that phantom worm?
What would it take for an adventurer to make a name for himself <cf>?
Honor, fame, and achievement. ...... <cf>Whatever it is, you need a worthy adversary.
I can't just prepare enemies of my own making. <cf>It's quite distressing.
Okay, it's back to producing adventurers! <cf>Ready for your debut?
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. <cf>I'll get you this time. I'm going to get the name "Bandit Killer"!
This time we're going to take down a bandit with a name. <cf>We're going to make an indisputable achievement.
How convenient for such bandits, you ask?
Hmmm...don't worry. <cf>We've already found them.
The Bandit Brothers' "Skull Brothers"! <cf>This is the target this time.
These guys are rumored to be hunting animals and laying out their <cf>skulls in their hideout.
Some people have bad taste, don't they?
There are a lot of people out there who are suffering. <cf>If we beat these guys, people will recognize their ability!
The "Skull Brothers" are brothers and they work separately. <cf>Let's take them out first, starting with the little brother.
But I hear they are pretty strong bandits. <cf>You have to be very careful.
Target is " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_02_01001"/>". <cf>Located at " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>".
My brother's whereabouts are at <cf>I'll make sure I find him before you get back.
When you beat your brother, come back here. <cf>Because I believe you can do it.
My brother is at ' <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_02_01001"/>'. <cf>He's at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>.
Good luck. <cf>Come back here when you've taken them down.
You've beaten " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_02_01001"/>"!
That's the kind of adventurer I've been looking for. <cf>Now the "Skull Brothers" brother is clear!
Well then, at this rate <cf>I'll do the "Skull Brothers" brother as well!
The target is " <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_03_01001"/>". <cf>He should be at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".
My brother is a knife fighter, and I hear he's tougher than my brother. <cf>You have to be ready for anything before you take on this challenge.
Don't worry. <cf>You're going to win!
Now I have to go sell it to the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>When you defeat them, come to the settlement office.
That's when your path to glory will <cf>begin in spectacular fashion!
My brother is at <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_03_01001"/>. <cf>He's at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".
They are tough opponents, but you can handle them!
Come to the pioneer station when you're done. <cf>This time we'll make your debut!
Good job, my "bandit killer"!
We were just talking about you.
Look, there's our adventurer. <cf>The "Bandit Killer" who defeated the "Skull Brothers!
An unblemished track record, right? <cf>Come on, let's give this guy a big promotion!
Actually, the report of the defeat of the "Skull Brothers" was received by <cf>the other day from another adventurer.
It has been confirmed by the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>So, perhaps I have a hunch wrong.
What? ...... Yeah, yeah, yeah! <cf>Oh, no, that can't be right!
When the name "Skull Brothers" became known, <cf>there were bandits who imitated them!
The skulls in the hideout, the part where they call themselves brothers, etc. <cf>So does the fact that one of them uses a knife.
I think Mr. Barni thought one of those guys was <cf>"Skull Brothers".
No way! <cf>What did I do to make such a mistake ......
But it is true that you took down the bandits <cf>
I really appreciate it, guys. <cf>Thank you very much.
I can't produce, etc., but <cf>also help people!
Crap. ......!　I'm so sorry. <cf>This time it was totally my fault.
But I did get some appreciation from people. <cf>Maybe you've even gotten a little recognition.
We've had a good response, so <cf>let's approach it from a different angle next time!
Let's not give up, and let's both work hard again to make our <cf>debut together!
I'm going to switch it up. <cf>I'll make sure I sell you out next time.
What do you give up? <cf>This is my dream too!
I'm the strongest and loneliest bounty hunter ....... <cf>I make money a day by taking down bounty hunters.
Hoo ...... I'll have to find my next catch soon. <cf>I live for the day and have no money.
Huff, I can't tell you how many times I've seen you like this <cf>......
Three times I challenge you to a match!
Can you beat this strongest and lone bounty hunter, <cf>Mino!
If you want to know why I became a bounty hunter <cf>you need to beat me!
The first step is to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>. <cf>As usual, the one who kills the most number of them wins!
Don't sit back in amazement, okay? <cf>I've already beaten <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>nine of them!
You know what I'm talking about. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>You can't just take down 10 of them!
They are hanging around ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>'. <cf>It's a dangerous place to just go.
If we can defeat them, we will admit defeat gracefully and <cf>I will reveal all!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>" and try to kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>!
Can you top me? <cf>I'm looking forward to it!
Really <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>said they took down 10 of them. ......
What heights does this thing reach!
...... Okay, I get it. <cf>If you insist, I'll only reveal it to you.
I'll tell you why I became a bounty hunter.
[It was shortly after I arrived in Salamzart. <cf>I ran into one <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>
Apparently, he was famous for vandalizing fields. <cf>There was a bounty on him.
I took him down and <cf>got some money out of it.
That's when it hit me! <cf>A bounty hunter of the stream ...... this is ......!
I deserve to be the strongest and the loneliest!　And!
If only I had this bounty, my sister's illness would be ......
No, it's nothing! <cf>It's already past. Don't look back!
Bounty hunters only have to live for this day!　 <cf>Now, the real work begins here!
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>You don't think you've won the game <cf>so much as you've defeated the "Mere Old Man", do you?
Look! <cf>Here's the wanted list with the bounty on it.
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>"! <cf>Whoever defeats this guy and gets the gold wins!
The <cf>desert monster ...... that is said to appear in " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>". It's me or you who will defeat it first!
The target is " <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>"! <cf>It appears at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"!
Now, let's see who can beat them first! <cf>Now, we need to get ready to fight in the desert: ......
Now, you are ready to go. <cf>This is all you need to fight in the desert: ......
<span size="Big">What? &lt;/&gt;
I already beat " <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>"!
Nonsense! <cf>You're dealing with a monster, a feared monster of the desert!
This doesn't tell <cf>which one is the real monster!
...... All right. I'll admit it. <cf>I lost this time!
I hear that " <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>" was <cf>a vicious monster that burrowed through the fields.
I'm sure the farmers will be happy to hear that! <cf>Receive your reward with pride!
Of course I'll pay for <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>. <cf>Don't worry, I haven't forgotten.
You are a true bounty hunter who has surpassed me here! <cf>Now let's give you credit!
But I'm not done yet! <cf>Next time I'll show you everything I've got!
See you soon!　Farewell!
Hmmm ....... <cf>What title shall I take on next?
This is the place to go back to the starting point. <cf>Let's go back to Asterleeds and discuss this once.
The Pioneer Bureau is always ready to help you with anything!
The best and most solitary I can be called: ....... <cf>I got some good tips!
Looks like it's finally here. <cf>I'm going to settle this with you, and this is the time: ......
The strongest and lone all-rounder, <cf>Mino challenges you to a match!
Let's settle our scores right here and now, <cf>!
HUH. I guess you're curious to know how I became an all-rounder <cf>
Then you have to beat me here!
The stage for the competition is " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"! <cf>A difficult challenge only for skilled adventurers!
I took down one <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/>there!
Can you outperform me? <cf>Take down two of them and you win!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>" to take down !　Let's do it!
Try to defeat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/>at " <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"!
Take down two of them and you win! <cf>The road to additional research is steep. Don't neglect your preparations!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/>Two of them! <cf>You've really beaten them!
What a guy. ......　Is this the work of God?
Kukku ...... kukku. <cf>But I'm not surprised by all this.
You and I have fought many hard fought <cf>battles.
However, a promise is a promise. <cf>Let me reveal why I became an all-rounder!
I'm a Soldier-revamped Hero-revamped Bounty Hunter! <cf>This is too long for any amount of time!
So I consulted with the Pioneer Bureau! <cf>Then it happened: ......
["]Huh. How about an all-rounder, then?
That's what I was advised! <cf>It was a true revelation to me!
An all-rounder who can do anything! <cf>Don't you think I deserve to be the strongest and the loneliest?
With this all-around power, <cf>I'm sure that childhood friend of yours will be ......!
No, it's nothing! <cf>That thing is a done deal!
Anyway, the game continues! <cf>You have to be an all-rounder to be able to do all kinds of jobs!
The next stage is " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>"! <cf>The winner is the one who defeats " <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_04_01001"/>" first!
The winner is the one who defeats " <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_04_01001"/>" with " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>"!
You are indeed a formidable opponent. ...... <cf>I need to prepare. Let's go through the stores.
Asterleeds has so many stores, after all. <cf>It's so much fun to shop!
Well, it's time to leave: ......
And <span size="Big">what the heck? &lt;/&gt;
You already beat " <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_04_01001"/>"!
Two, strong ......!　That's my rival ......! <cf>No, my rival for life!
Being born in the same era as you <cf>may be my greatest misfortune ......!
But the all-rounder never gives up! <cf>Now, the next is the last game!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" appears in " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"! <cf>I'm sure you've at least heard of it.
He is the source of all this! <cf>The one I've been searching for until I became an all-rounder!
The winner is the one who beats this guy first!
But beware. The " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" is <cf>a powerful enemy that has knocked many adventurers into an abyss of fear.
Even you, I admit, might struggle.
...... No. <cf>What are you being so wishy-washy about, me?
I'm sure you and I can do it! <cf>I know you will!
Wash your head and wait for it, ' <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>'!
The last target is <cf>" <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" which appears on " <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"
If you fight, you'll have a better idea of what you're up against ....... <cf>I agree. Let's say goodbye to our friends before we leave.
Hoo ......It's good to reconnect with friends. <cf>Even if it's the last time you see them.
Now we've said our goodbyes. <cf>I guess I got a little too much to talk about, after all I did.
I'm sorry to leave, but it's time to leave. ......
I mean, <span size="Big">what the heck? &lt;/&gt;
I've beaten " <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" ah!
Wow, that's amazing ......!　What a great ....... <cf>That's my life-long competitor!
So ....... <cf>Now those guys can float away. ......
No, tears are useless now!
For once, let's celebrate honestly! <cf>Congratulations, lifelong rival!　You win!
I'm not ready to be an all-rounder yet! <cf>I have to give back that title and start training from scratch!
Keep it with you until you're ready to work out! <cf>You are the one who deserves to call himself an all-rounder!
See you later! <cf>It was a hot competition!　It was a lot of fun!
Now, let's start working out from scratch!
Let's start with a name! <cf>What kind of name do you think is appropriate for me?
Toto got mad again.
That one, <cf>I couldn't win at rock-paper-scissors all the time.
How can I help you understand?
Can you play rock-paper-scissors, adventurer?
A game in which you decide who wins or loses by playing goo, choki, or per. <cf>I want you to help me with that.
Nene's friend Toto is very weak at <cf>rock-paper-scissors.
I always make a goo first, and <cf>it shows in my expression when I make my next move.
So Nene, I've never lost to Toto once.
I'd like to tell Toto about it, but <cf>he's not very understanding ......
Nene always wins because <cf>Nene says it's because she cheats.
I know it's rude. <cf>But I really want to do something about it.
Adventurer. <cf>Play rock-paper-scissors with Toto instead of Nene.
I think if we lose to someone other than Nene, she'll understand.
Let's go to Toto's place then. <cf>Remember how to play rock-paper-scissors-paper.
Oh, Nene! <cf>What is it? You came to tease me again?
Hey, Toto. <cf>Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
No!　You're cheating. <cf>I'm not playing rock-paper-scissors with Nene anymore!
Not with Nene, but with the adventurer over here. <cf>That would be good, right?
You and ......?
Well, that's good. <cf>I'll show you that I'm really good at rock-paper-scissors-scissors!
(Adventurer. <cf>　Toto will always give you goo first.)
(Adventurers, you'll have to put up par.)
(Toto always plays goo first, so <cf>adventurers, play par.)
(The first one is "goo", after all! <cf>　I'll play goo and win the rock paper scissors!)
Gwahhhh! <cf>I lost at rock-paper-scissors again!
See, I always say. <cf>Toto will be the first to goof up. ......
Shut up, shut up! <cf>That was just an accident!
Come on, adventurers, one more game!
Toto is still mad at me.
(You know what? <cf>　When he's angry, Toto will give you a choki.)
(Adventurers, please play goo.)
(When he's angry, Toto will give you a scissors. <cf>　(Adventurers, you must play goo.)
(Damn!　(Damn it! <cf>　I'll definitely win with choki!)
Geez!　I lost again!
See, I'm telling you. <cf>Whenever Toto gets angry, he always chokes ......
I don't believe this! <cf>I don't believe I'm ...... gssh, I don't believe I'm weak ...... higg...
I feel kind of sorry for ......
(Please, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>　Could you please beat me on purpose this time?)
(Toto will always play goo when he's about to cry.)
(So, adventurers, I want you to give me choki. <cf>　Sorry. I didn't mean to ask you to lose.)
(When Toto is about to cry, he always gives a goo. <cf>　So I want the adventurers to give him choki.)
(I'm sorry that you want me to lose on purpose. <cf>　But I feel a little sorry for Toto.)
(Gosh, gosh. ....... <cf>　Next time I'm going to give you some goo!)
(I'm sure Goo would ...... <cf>but what if he loses again ......)
I won! <cf>I did it, I won the rock-paper-scissors game!
You did it, Toto!　Congratulations!
Yeah!　I see. ....... <cf>I finally figured it out.
It seems Nene was right. <cf>She knows what I'm going to serve up.
You let me win on purpose, didn't you? <cf>I saw the look on your face when you saw me.
I'll be more conscious of rock-paper-scissors from now on. <cf>Thanks for letting me win!
Finally, they understand me. <cf>Good.
Maybe the most important thing was not to talk about it, but to <cf>let them win at rock-paper-scissors-scissors.
Thanks, adventurer. <cf>From now on, Toto and I will have fun playing rock-paper-scissors!
Are you rock-paper-scissors, adventurer?
Adventurers, have fun playing rock-paper-scissors with everyone!
Need a fortune teller ......?　Sorry ....... <cf>I'm doing another fortune telling right now ......
Oh ...... bad results won't change. ...... <cf>I don't know what to do: ......
I wonder why people don't believe my fortune telling <cf>......
You know, ....... <cf>Things are about to get bad. ......
There's no doubt about it. ...... <cf>I'm hoping you can prevent that from happening. ......
First, George has a stomachache: ......
The drinks he buys are hurting me. ...... <cf>If he gets sick to his stomach, it will be very painful. ......
Pretend to be careless and spill it. ......
And buy George a drink <cf>to pay you back. ...... I'll give you the bill. ......
Please do. ...... <cf>George is at the "Mawaru Rudder Wheel Pavilion" ......
Go to "Mawaru Rudder Wheel Pavilion" <cf>and spill George's drink on him. ......
If I drink it, it will upset my stomach. ...... <cf>That's what my horoscope told me. ...... Please ......
Hmm?　What? <cf>I'm George.
Oops!　My drink spilled!
...... What?　Can I buy you a drink to say sorry? <cf>That's no problem!
Yum!　Yum!
Belinda, the fortune teller told me I'd have a stomach ache. <cf>She seems to be all right!
That fortune-telling doesn't come true at all. <cf>Well, it would be better if bad fortunes didn't come true.
You know Belinda, the fortune teller?
My prediction of a stomach ache came true. <cf>Next time you see him, tell him I said so.
George was saved. ...... <cf>Good for him. ......
The next bad thing you want to prevent is ....... <cf>Natasha's cooking Bapharia heritage is broken. ......
The legacy she uses is ...... <cf>of being able to chop ingredients into whatever size you want. ......
It's so useful ...... <cf>I think I'll be in trouble if it breaks ......
If only Natasha had told us when she tried to use it, <cf>nothing would have happened ......
Natasha should be selling her lunch near the town gate square ...... <cf>
Talk to ...... <cf>to keep Bapharia's legacy from breaking down. ......
Yes?　What can I get you? <cf>One lunch!　Thank you!
Oops, I just ran out of prep ingredients. <cf>I have to prepare it.
Oh, what? <cf>Belinda's fortune-telling?
Oh, they told me something bad. <cf>He said to be careful because it would destroy Bapharia's legacy.
I use Bapharia's Heritage for cooking. <cf>It comes in handy because it cuts the ingredients right up.
I'd hate for it to break, but <cf>it's not like that, it's still working fine, okay?
It looks like your fortune-telling was wrong. <cf>Well, it's fortune-telling after all, and that's the way it goes.
If it's Ms. Belinda's fortune-telling, it's off.
If you go off too much, you'll lose customers. <cf>You should warn Belinda.
So Natasha's Bapharia legacy didn't <cf>break down either. ......
Good to hear. ...... <cf>These two seem to have worked: ......
But there's another bad fortune telling ......
Minsterhorn just came out of an attack on <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>......
This is going to be a big problem. ...... <cf>We absolutely have to prevent it. ......
' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>' to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and ....... <cf>Please ...... we can't leave them alone. ......
We can use " <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and ....... <cf>We can't leave them alone. ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>You took down the ......
It's okay now: ....... <cf>Nothing will happen to Minsterhorn: ......
You prevented all the bad fortunes. ...... <cf>You are a wonderful adventurer. ......
What ......?　So this means that the fortune-telling was right <cf>and no one will ever know ......?
Yes, ....... <cf>I'm sad that you don't believe in fortune telling. ......
It's always better when no one is unhappy <cf>......
That's fine. ...... <cf>It's so trivial that it makes me laugh. ......
Besides, you know <cf>that Atashi's horoscopes come true ......?
It's good to have someone like that, even if only a little. ...... <cf>Thanks a lot. ......
Oh ...... you ....... <cf>Do you want me to tell you something ......?
Sorry ....... <cf>It seems I can't see into your future: ......
I'm sure you'll be able to move forward on your own. ...... <cf>You don't need a fortune teller. ......
Fortune tellers have to tell it like they see it <cf>......
I know, but what should I do ....... ...... <cf>I just said something different from the results. ......
I don't know what to do: ......
I'm sorry ....... <cf>I'm a fortune teller and I faked the results: ......
I'm from Salamzart ...... <cf>I divined a girl named Emilee ......
By the time she got back to Salamzart, ...... <cf>it was the result of nothing in particular. ......
But she ...... seemed to be having too much fun ...... <cf>and was excited ......
So I ended up telling ...... a lie about my horoscope. ......
["]Get the good stuff at Asterleeds[,]"] I said <cf>......
Emilee was very pleased. ...... <cf>But that's not what a fortune teller is supposed to do. ......
I know I shouldn't be asking you to do this, but ...... <cf>I wonder if you could really do some fortune telling for me ......
It's Atashi's fault. ...... <cf>But I didn't want to disappoint Emilee. ......
How about picking up a ...... "rainbow ball" ....... <cf>They are precious stones that glow in seven different colors and are very expensive. ......
I have one here: ...... <cf>Can you deliver it to Emilee: ......?
Don't tell me you're giving it to me from Atashi. ...... <cf>Because they will know about the fortune telling. ......
Deliver the "Rainbow Ball" to Emilee: ......
Because she is still staying at <cf>Asterleeds ......
Oh, hello there. <cf>Mr. Adventurer.
What?　Did you send me? <cf>I wonder who sent it.
Can't say ......?　Really? <cf>The delivery is ...... Oh, "Rainbow Balls". Beautiful.
Hmmm. Thanks, but I'm not sure I'd want to be gifted such an expensive item by a complete stranger <cf>
I'm sorry. <cf>Adventurer, please return the "Rainbow Ball".
If I could have anything, I'd be happy with <cf>"Starstone".
It's a stone that is said to make wishes come true.
I have a dream of becoming an actress. <cf>Dreams can't be bought with money.
I'm sorry I went to the trouble of having it delivered. <cf>Please give my regards to the giver of "Rainbow Balls.
Money can't buy my dream of becoming an actress.
You didn't get Emilee interested in "Rainbow Balls" ...... <cf>
I think you said you wanted a "Starstone" <cf>......
The legend that wishes come true is ...... <cf>true, but ......
I don't think it's worth it ...... <cf>because it's often dropped on the streets ......
But for Emilee it's ...... <cf>a good thing ......
Adventurers, please visit ....... <cf>Can you help me find the "Starstone" ......
You can find them at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>' ....... <cf>You can deliver them to Emilee at ......
If you give them a gift from you after hearing their story, ...... <cf>I'm sure they'll accept it this time. ......
Look for "Starstone" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"...
You can deliver them to Emilee at ....... <cf>It looks like he's still in Asterleeds. ......
Hello, adventurer. <cf>Hello again.
What, ......? <cf>They're going to give me a "Starstone"!
Wow, I'm glad!　Thank you!
Did you remember that I said I wanted it? <cf>You support my dream, don't you?
I'm really happy! <cf>I'm going to keep this as a good luck charm!
I got a very nice one. <cf>...... Well, that fortune-telling came true!
I had a fortune teller named Belinda read me <cf>["]get good things ["]"].
Wow, that's great! <cf>Belinda's fortune-telling was spot on!
Adventurers!　If you see Belinda, tell her thanks at <cf>
Emilee said she was very grateful! <cf>She said she would make her dream come true and that she would support me!
Tell Belinda thanks for the fortune telling.
Emilee said she was very grateful!
You delivered "Starstone" to <cf>Emile ......
So ...... glad you're happy....... <cf>Good ...... thank you ......
Emilee is an amazing girl. ...... <cf> I believe that ["]the future can only be good ["]......
The purity of it was so dazzling that ...... <cf>I wanted to make it happen. ......
But I knew it was ...... <cf>unbecoming of a fortune teller. ......
Besides, what's valuable varies from person to person. ......
It was really shallow of me ...... <cf>to think that something expensive would make you happy. ......
I am so grateful to you and Emilee for making me aware of that ...... <cf>
Thanks a lot. ...... <cf>I'll work on my divination, just like Emilee: ......
As usual ...... <cf>my horoscopes have a reputation for not being accurate ......
But ...... I feel like I can be the catalyst for ...... <cf>the person I tell my fortune to notice something. ......
I'm so glad you did. ......
Hi, are you here at the request of the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>I'm a member of the Star Vein Hole Research Team.
Star vein holes appear irregularly here as well. <cf>The location of the connection does not seem to be fixed.
But it seems <cf>obvious that there's a hell of a monster inside!
It's not an opponent that one person can compete with. <cf>If we do go in, it will be with a large group.
Can you report that to the Pioneer Station? <cf>I'll keep an eye on it from another location.
Maybe it will change what you see. <cf>Well then, please keep me posted.
You're from the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>We're from the department in charge of defensive warfare.
We are working daily on tactics for the defense of the city. <cf>Sharing information from adventurers is greatly appreciated.
When the time comes for the monsters to strike, <cf>your cooperation will be essential!
At the start of the defense, I'd like you to speak to the bureau staff here: <cf>
In order to organize and defend itself, <cf>registers and manages the information of its members who participate in the war.
Monsters come in groups. <cf>If we fight them piecemeal, we won't stand a chance.
It is a necessary procedure to maintain the front line. <cf>We ask for your understanding.
Then we will remain vigilant. <cf>Please report to the Pioneer Bureau to that effect. That's all.
Huh, I got some good information.
Monsters that the Knights have not yet dealt with. <cf>This is what the Star Adventurers are after!
This time there's no mistaking my produce. <cf>Star adventurers are born here, in the Principality of Bernhardt!
Long time no see! <cf>I'm Barni, the world's first adventurer producer.
Come on, let's get back to your producing.
The world is always looking for a star. <cf>I knew you would come here.
The people of the Principality of Bernhardt are the ones who are waiting for the <cf>star adventurers to come along!
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. <cf>This time, I got the leading information before anyone else did.
Between you and me. <cf>Actually, I heard that there is a machina that is not under the control of the Order.
I guess you could call it a stray machina ....... <cf>She's been spotted around the streets and fields.
No real damage has been done yet, but <cf>we're all worried.
That's where you come in!
We'll take down the stray machina and prevent any damage before it happens. <cf>Then everyone will be overjoyed!
The Knights haven't even addressed it yet, and <cf>now would certainly give you credit for that.
A star adventurer who is the first to arrive in everyone's pinch and solve <cf>it in a dashing manner!
Hmph ...... this scenario is the perfect one. <cf>You are taking your first steps as a star!
Let's start taking them down immediately! <cf>The sighting was of a Makina Fox.
Find "Castle Shadows Shadows" and defeat it. <cf>And report back to me with your findings.
Come on, we're going for it together! <cf>Machina Buster to save us all!
The witness is Makina Fox. <cf>Looks like she's wandering away from the Order's control.
He should be in "Castle Shadows" <cf>so please find him and take him down!
Report back to me with your results. <cf>Come on, let's go for it!　The name of the Machina Buster!
Welcome back. <cf>Did you finish defeating Makina Fox?
Thanks for the help. <cf>I've been around to help you sell: ......
A soldier from the Knights of Bernhardt came out and <cf>almost got me.
[There is no such thing as a Machina that has left the control of the Order! <cf>Nor would it be possible to put people in danger! ["]]
''[Therefore,] there is no need to be defeated by adventurers! <cf>Do not clamor for something that does not exist! ["]]
He said ......
I know. That face. <cf>I know what you mean~?
You're not actually hanging around there, are you? <cf>Don't sneak around and cover it up!　You know, .......
But I can't move if the Knights are staring at me. <cf>Oh, I don't know what to do.
Hey, guys. <cf>Can I have a word with you?
I overheard something. <cf>You're the adventurer who says he's fighting Makina, right?
I have a favor to ask you. <cf>Makina ripped up the nets we use for fishing.
I'd like to repair it, but I can't get near it because of <cf>machina.
Could you please collect the <cf>"Torn Throw Nets" that are lying around in "Castle Shadows".
Hmmm... ....... <cf>From the looks of it, it sounds like you're in trouble.
That's right. <cf>I'm asking the soldiers to do it for me.
It's kind of lazy. <cf>I don't know if he's going to do it or not, all he does is reply.
Ah, I see. <cf>You were told something similar to us.
I've heard your story. Why don't you help him? <cf>I don't like the aftertaste of being left alone.
I don't want to be thought of as a soldier.
I'll help you this time. <cf>Let's collect the "torn cast nets.
Let's collect the <cf>"Torn Throw Nets" scattered around "Castle Shadows"!
It looks like Makina is nearby, so be careful. <cf>I'll sneak out and collect them too.
Let's help people steadily and build <cf>a track record!
Thanks for your help! <cf>Looks like you finished collecting the "torn cast nets".
I've picked up a few things myself. <cf>I knew you'd work faster than me.
Somehow, you have to get <cf>the world to recognize your talent!
Well, thank you! <cf>Now I can finally repair the nets.
I'll tell everyone about you guys. <cf>I heard there was a good and kind adventurer.
I hope this production was a success.
I didn't become a Machina Buster, but I did <cf>solve a lot of the town's problems, and they appreciated it.
This small success is one step toward the great success to come!
I can't let this happen! <cf>We have to come up with a new plan for the next round.
It's my job to think! <cf>My mission is to make you shine!
You can count on it! <cf>I'll make a fancy decision next time!
Hmmm ....... I didn't expect the state power to <cf>pull my leg.
I hate it when there are so many ties. <cf>No, you have to destroy it to be a star. ......
I think I see something here: ....... <cf>Maybe I'll get some good ideas!
Hello! <cf>Um, can I ask you for directions?
The Duchy of Bernhardt, not the upper ....... <cf>It's up north, right?
Right?　I knew!　I knew!
Then we should just go straight over that mountain. <cf>We won't get lost this time. Thank you very much!
It is indeed in the direction of the Duchy of Bernhardt, but <cf>I ran into a mountainous area without a single road ......
Hey, hey!　You know the way, don't you? <cf>I don't suppose you know which way is the Duchy of Bernhardt?
I thought I was headed straight north, but <cf>I find myself in a place I don't know at all!
Sure, we went through the mountains with no roads, <cf>and even dug into a cave somewhere if we wanted to. ......
I don't think the Principality of Bernhardt is the place to be! <cf>Please show us the way!
Thanks! <cf>I'm actually in the process of Accepting your request.
The innkeeper in Kanaloa has asked me to <cf>deliver an amulet to her son.
His son is a soldier of the Duchy of Bernhardt. <cf>He's on a training exercise right now.
I hope you come back safe and sound. <cf>It's a good luck charm that my mom put her heart and soul into.
I had to deliver it before the exercise was over, right? <cf>That's why I left so quickly.
Depart Kanaloa and head straight for the campsite at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>".
...... and then I got lost and here I was!
Wow!　My silly!
I'm always like that! <cf>I don't know the way, I run out of water and food.
I've already conquered all the edible plants in the area. <cf>It was fun to taste so many different flavors.
Anyway, I have to deliver the amulet to your son. <cf>If I don't do it soon, the exercise will be over!
Please! <cf>Please take me to the camp at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>'!
Take me to the camp of " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>"! <cf>I have to deliver the amulet to the soldier.
Of course, I don't know the way, okay? <cf>You are my only hope!　Please!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can we do for you?
Accepted the request! <cf>I had an amulet from Kanaloa's mom.
We were talking about delivering <cf>to the soldiers in this camp. ......
A good luck charm? <cf>Oh, you mean Captain Helmut.
He said he left it at home. <cf>I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Thank goodness! I got it to you. <cf>Now I can go on with my exercises without any worries!
What?　If it's a training exercise, we're done. <cf>We're on our way home now. ......
Gahhhhhh! <cf>I didn't make it in time~ sorry!
Because I, silly me, <cf>get lost or something~!
Um, ....... <cf>Did I say something bad?
Oh ...... look!　Looks like the captain is back.
Huh?　What's the rush? ......
We found a herd of runaway <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> <cf>Raquel!　We'll intercept!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>A herd of people! <cf>Just me and the captain!
If that's the way it is, I understand!　I'm on it!
What, early ....... <cf>Are you sure?　With your help.
Adventurers don't abandon people in trouble! <cf>And I have to give the amulet to Mr. Helmut!
Also, personally, I'd like to be allowed to make up that ...... <cf>tardiness. ......
I'm sorry! <cf>You too, just a little more help!
Let's split up and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>! <cf>To deliver the amulet, please!
In order to deliver the amulet to Mr. Helmut, <cf>we need to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>first!
They should be running rampant at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>". <cf>Let's split up and go take them down!
Welcome back! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>Good job on the defeat!
Pissary, you are the adventurer you mentioned. <cf>I am Helmut. I am Raquel's superior.
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>I heard that you helped us to defeat them. <cf>I thank you. Thank you.
It really helped me. <cf>You both are very strong.
Pissary ran in a different direction after the defeat <cf>for some reason, but ......
Yes ....... Sorry. <cf>I almost got lost just getting back to camp.
Oh, yes. <cf>I have a delivery for Mr. Helmut!
Oh, thank you. <cf>I heard my mother asked you to do this for her. I certainly got it.
Thank goodness - the request is complete this time! <cf>Thank you so much for sticking with me.
Thanks for coming all the way to this place. <cf>Take care, both of you, and go home.
Oh, about that. <cf>Do you know how to get to Asterleeds?
Asterleeds? <cf>Then there's a regular boat from Bernhardt.
Just go to the port and get on a regular boat and you'll be there in no time!
When you enter the town of Bernhardt, go to <cf>this way, this alley is this way, ......
Mr. Pissarri?
<span size="Big">What, ......? &lt;/&gt;
Uh, let's see! <cf>Well, I think I've got it about figured out!　I guess. ...... maybe
Thanks for all your company. <cf>I'll go home alone from here.
And it would be bad if I dragged you any further. <cf>I've been given directions, so I'm good!　...... daijoubu
Well, it's been days since I've been home, and I've forgotten how long it's been! <cf>Let's go straight home, no detours!
Also, <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>should not be allowed to get out of control. <cf>Captain Helmut's orders are to make the rounds!
But still, I hope ...... Pissary is ok.
Bernhardt Castle is very conspicuous and <cf>I don't think you'll get lost ......
If you take a liner, you can get to Asterleeds in your sleep. <cf>It's ok ......, right?
That man won't come to the store.
I wonder if they didn't like my cooking. <cf>But it didn't look spicy. ......
I've never met anyone who eats silently. <cf>I'm kind of curious.
Hello adventurers <cf>I am Areni. I run a cooking restaurant.
I don't know why I can only make very spicy food. ...... <cf>But I get customers who like spicy food.
Everyone cried and screamed and said <cf>["]Delicious["]["]I can't stop my hands, I'm dying["]"].
It's worth making because of the lively atmosphere.
But the other day, I had a customer who was acting strangely.
I was excited to come into the restaurant, but as soon as I <cf>tasted the food, I was shushed.
He didn't break a sweat, eating silently and looking <cf>complicated the whole time!
I had never had a customer like that before. <cf>I guess my food didn't suit his palate.
I was kind of curious. <cf>But then he never came to the store.
Adventurer, please find that customer. <cf>We'd like to have a proper talk with him.
I asked one of our regulars and found out his name is <cf>Bosch!
Eh?　Do you know the adventurers too?
I see. I've made a request to an adventurer before at ....... <cf>It's a curious coincidence, isn't it?
Please take Mr. Bosch to the store. <cf>Please do me the favor.
Adventurer, you knew Mr. Bosch at <cf>
I believe you are in Asterleeds, so please bring Mr. Bosch here <cf>
Hey, what's that?　Isn't that the adventurer from back in the day?
You see, to eat Areni's very spicy food, <cf>you asked for a pill that would make you not feel the spiciness.
I remember it well because I ruined the taste of her food and <cf>the adventurer.
As usual, I can't eat spicy food, but I'm <cf>working out a little bit at a time.
Someday I'll eat all of Aleni's food so I can tell her <cf>["]it was delicious["]!
What, ......? <cf>That Aleni wants to meet me!
I was thinking of going to eat there <cf>after I work on my tongue a bit more ......
This could be a chance to confess to her!
Of course I'll go! <cf>Oh, but it's rude to go empty-handed.
Okay, I want to give a bouquet of flowers! <cf>I want to give Areni a "True White Sunflower".
It should be blooming at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>', so please take me to <cf>
I'm coming with you. <cf>I want to see Areni in my own sincere way.
Let's pick the "True White Sunflower" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>". <cf>Will you take me to that place?
I want to make it into a bouquet and present it to Aleni. <cf>Thank you very much.
I found the "True White Sunflower" requested by Bosch.
You found the flowers. <cf>I want to get you a total of three.
Let's look for other places too!
Thank you!　Now we have three bottles.
I'll get to work on the bouquet right away. <cf>I need you to find me a place near here where I can settle down.
I think I can work calmly here. <cf>Thank you for collecting the "True White Sunflower.
This freshness, dainty. <cf>I think it would look great on Aleni.
Wrap this up and ...... shape it up and ....... <cf>Okay, it's done!
I'll give you this bouquet and tell you the truth. <cf>Then ...... I'll tell you how I feel too.
All that's left is my courage. <cf>Come on, let's go to Aleni's!
Come with me and see it through!
I've got a bouquet of flowers to present to Aleni. <cf>Now I just need to be brave enough to give them to her.
Let's go to her store in Asterleeds.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>You brought Mr. Bosch with you.
Hello, Mr. Bosch. <cf>You visited our store before.
But the way he was eating looked so somber. <cf>I was kind of curious about it. ......
Was my food not to your taste?
No, no! <cf>Your food was great. ...... should be, I'm sure.
Actually, I can't eat spicy food. <cf>I was on a pill at the time that made me not feel spicy anymore.
And then I couldn't taste it.
I'm sorry I ruined your food. <cf>I felt very rude to you too. ......
So I couldn't look up.
Well, you did. <cf>But why did you go to such lengths to cook my food?
It's ...... that, cohon
A, Mr. Areni! <cf>Will you accept this bouquet of flowers!
This is how I feel!
This to ...... me?
...... Oh, ....... <cf>So that's what that was about!
Yes, that's right!　I've always been a fan of yours ......!
The nectar of the "sun flower" is very sweet. <cf>If you put it in your cooking, it may mellow the flavor.
Even if you don't like spicy food, <cf>you may enjoy it!
Hmm, I'm so glad you went that far to eat my food <cf>!
Please wait. <cf>I'll cook with these flowers now.
Huh?　Oh, no!　It's not that. ......
Aleni's new dish?　Let's see. ....... <cf>Ahiiiiiii!　Hiyahhhh!
The faint sweetness of the nectar enhances the spiciness! <cf>Swallowed in an endless loop of spiciness ugh!
Ugh, my gosh. ....... <cf>I never knew flower nectar could have such an effect.
It has become more and more spicy. <cf>I, for one, don't know how to eat ......
Mr. Bosch!　Thank you very much. <cf>We are very pleased with our new menu!
...... Well, okay. <cf>Areni looks so happy to see me like that.
I have trained myself to endure hardship. <cf>Now is the time for me to summon up my courage once again!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I will definitely take this chance!
Hello, adventurers. <cf>Our new menu with the nectar of the "Sun Flower" is very popular!
Just looking at these flowers was calming, wasn't it? <cf>They were so beautiful that I decorated some of them in my store!
We are very grateful to Bosch. <cf>He has come to us many times for food and
We need to cook more and better <cf>so that Mr. Bosch doesn't get bored with us!
Oooohhhh ......ッ!
Tough, this training ......! <cf>My legs are pumping!
But I will endure!　I will train! <cf>To become a man worthy of his new calling!
My life-long rival!　Welcome!
Defeat after defeat, I became stronger! <cf>It is no exaggeration to say that I have been reborn!
He trained from the ground up and rethought himself!
I'm evolving every day!　Today is the day I surpass you! <cf>It's a match!　Calling on Sargent!
Are you wondering why you are a Sargent now? <cf>The answer lies beyond the battle!
If you want to know, go beyond me!
First, we need to take down the Makina Fox! <cf>I've already killed nine of them!
You know the rest. <cf>If you can take down 10 of them, you win!
I'll reveal everything about me as a Sargent! <cf>Now, let's see what you can do!
This time, the target is Makina Fox! <cf>Take down 10 of them and you win!
Even Bernhardt's strongest soldiers are struggling against this opponent. <cf>A fierce battle is inevitable!　Be on your guard!
Well, that's not going to happen to you, though. <cf>My rival!　I'll be waiting for you here!
That guy is probably in a <cf>fight to the death with Makina Fox right now ......
I can't keep doing this! <cf>I'm going to do military squats ...... until he comes back, okay?
<span size="Big">What the heck? &lt;/&gt;
You've already taken down Makina Fox!
That's my acknowledged competitor. That's great!
Now I can gladly tell the story. <cf>The origin of my new moniker, Sargent!
I visited this place <cf>and observed the training of Bernhardt's soldiers!
I also learned an old word that has been passed down in the military here. <cf>That is "Sargent!
I'm not sure what it means, but it sounds kind of cool! <cf>And it sounds strong!　Perfect for me who works out!
Having experienced the traditional military-style training of the Duchy of Bernhardt <cf>, I no longer have a blind spot!
Yes, that's right!　In other words, I am the Sargent!
That man who entrusted me with his sword and scattered <cf>will surely be watching from beyond the sky ......
...... No, it's nothing! <cf>Sargent is one who looks forward and keeps moving forward!
I, Sargent, challenge you once again to a game of <cf>!
The next target is <value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/>! <cf>I've already taken down 4 of them!
Sargent, my rival, and you! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/>I wonder if I can beat five of them!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/>I'm going to defeat five of them! <cf>Then Sargent and I will admit defeat!
Do you understand! <cf>What the hell, keep your voice down!　Say you understand!
Woah woah woah ......! <cf>Bernhardt's style of military-style running is hard. ......
Come on, let's do another lap of the outer wall! <cf>At least three laps before he comes back. ...... hmm?
<span size="Big">Hey, what the hell? &lt;/&gt;
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/>You've been defeating the "Mere Old Man"?
Unbelievable!　But brilliant! <cf>Then there's only one word I can say!
I am impressed, sir! <cf>You are a true Sargent, Sir!
Hmph, as I thought, our rivals are great. <cf>I guess half-hearted training is no match for them.
This one needs further thorough training! <cf>Rivals, or rather, new Sargents!
I'm not giving up on winning! <cf>But you won today!　Congratulations!
Receive a reward for defeating monsters! <cf>I will surpass your strength one day!　Someday, I promise!
Even I, trained in military style training, <cf>can't match your strength.
There may no longer be any trials on this continent <cf>worthy of you and me.
So that would be ...... across the ocean? <cf>What, are you serious?
The master's son, <cf>everyone says he was an awesome miner.
Why did he run away from home? <cf>If there was someone like that, the heir would have been chosen right away.
When I lost something in the cave, <cf>took care of it for me. Adventurer
I have a little favor to ask you today.
My master, Mr. Baumann, <cf>is worried about his successor.
Actually, his son was here, but <cf>he ran away from home a long time ago.
His name is Mr. Einar. <cf>He was a very skilled miner.
Bang and bang, you'll find a vein of <cf>rare ore, and you'll be gunning for it.
I'm told it's become popular in Litze as well.
I am a miner myself. <cf>I wanted to be useful to my master, just like your son.
I would like to meet your son <cf>and talk to him.
His name is Mr. Einar. <cf>I heard that you are an actor in Salamzart.
What made you decide to go from miner to actor again <cf>?
Anyway, please let me meet Mr. Einar. <cf>I look forward to working with you!
I would like to meet Mr. Bauman's son, <cf>Einar.
I heard that you are an actor in Salamzart. <cf>Why did you go from miner to actor again?
Anyway, please take me to <cf><value type="locationName" id="cty02"/>!
I'm sorry. <cf>Is there a Mr. Einar here?
Einar? <cf>That's the trouble now. ......
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Just in time. Help me!
You're here for Einar, aren't you? <cf>He's out of town right now.
When she heard the kids weren't coming home, she ran out to <cf>look for them.
Einar is certainly strong, but <cf>desert monsters are temperamental.
That's no good! <cf>Adventurer, I'm counting on you too!
Please find Mr. Einar and his child and bring them back to <cf>
In the desert, I'm a liability. <cf>I'll wait for you here.
I think he's somewhere on ' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>'. <cf>Take care of Einar and the others, adventurer!
Please find Mr. Einar and his child and bring them back to <cf>town.
I heard that you are at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>". <cf>Please do me a favor, adventurer!
Huh?　You are ....... <cf>You're the adventurer who helped us before, aren't you?
What?　Did you come here looking for me?
Well, I see that you heard about us from your theater friends. <cf>Thanks for coming to find me.
As you can see, I was able to find the lost child at <cf>......
Big brother ....... <cf>Still full of monsters?
Ugh, what to do. ...... I'm scared.
It's okay. <cf>I'm here, and the adventurers are here.
I'll take you home, I promise.
Mr. Adventurer. Sorry, <cf>need a hand getting us back to town.
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>is more than I thought. <cf>I couldn't shake it off with this kid in my arms.
Could you please take them down and draw them away. <cf>In the meantime, we'll run to Salamzart.
I'm sorry to ask you to take on this dangerous role, but ....... <cf>Please, please, please.
I want you to take out the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>guys at <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>.
While the adventurers are pulling him in, <cf>I'll take him back to Salamzart.
Once you've taken down some of them, <cf>you can come back to <value type="locationName" id="cty02"/>
Hey there, adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>Thank you very much for taking them down.
It really helped. <cf>And that girl, we got her home safe and sound.
Well, I think I'll go back to the theater group too.
What?　Someone wants to meet me?
In the first place, he was looking for me at his request. ...... <cf>What, I didn't know that.
So your name is Mr. Isaac. <cf>Heh, ...... a miner who works at my dad's place.
In the past, I was certainly somewhat successful as a miner <cf>, but ......
Do you think what I have to say will be of any use? <cf>I'm in a position now to do my best onstage.
Oh, of course I wouldn't mind meeting you. <cf>I've been a great help to you, Mr. Adventurer.
Then let's go see Mr. Isaac.
So Mr. Isaac wants to talk to me.
Of course I don't mind meeting with you. <cf>Come on, let's go to Mr. Isaac's.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You brought Mr. Einar with you, didn't you?
Is your lost child ...... safe? <cf>That's good to hear!
Nice to meet you, Isaac. <cf>I am Einar. I heard that my father is taking care of you.
I heard you came all the way from <cf>Litze to meet me!
This is Isaac. My name is Isaac. <cf>Sorry for the sudden visit.
I'm still a novice, and I've been indebted to my <cf>master for all the help I've received.
So. I think the master still wants his son, Einar, to take over <cf>
Mr. Einar. <cf>Are you willing to return to Litze?
Thank you very much. <cf>But I intend to continue acting.
When the troupe came to Litze and I saw the play. <cf>I felt like I was destined to be there.
Perhaps mining is indeed suited to it. <cf>But I never felt as destined for it as I did for the stage.
Right now, I just want to do the best I can onstage.
Yasuyasuka on destiny......
I think my dad must have sensed <cf>that I couldn't devote myself to mining.
Right now, Isaac is more <cf>than I am, and he's facing his job properly as a miner!
He cares enough about me <cf>to visit me, a complete stranger, and he cares enough about my father to visit me.
I think Isaac is the one who felt destined for mining.
It is true that ...... may be so. <cf>I am a miner by vocation.
I can't wait to be told to quit mining. <cf>For Mr. Einar, that guy is an actor.
I must have been wrong. <cf>I'm sorry for bringing this up out of the blue.
Mr. Isaac. <cf>As a miner, can you help my parents?
I am relieved to have someone like you. <cf>I, too, will make up a stage I am not ashamed of.
Leave it to me! <cf>Someday, we'll go see a performance!
Adventurer. I'm so sorry <cf>for all the trouble I've caused you.
Without thinking about it, <cf>I'm going to try to do more mining.
I had a good talk too. <cf>Thanks, Adventurer.
I hope each of you will follow the path you feel destined to take and <cf>hope to see you again like this!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your help with Mr. Einar.
I'm still a novice, but I'm working hard as a <cf>miner.
I hope we don't cause too much worry to Mr. Baumann. <cf>We have to do our best first!
I, not 'I am' ....... <cf>Not 'I am,' but 'I am.' ......
It's hard to talk like a soldier. <cf>I'm new, so I have to learn quickly.
Well, I have to remember! <cf>...... am I right?
It's packed with a tremendous amount of weeds.
To the right and left, everything is a pile of weeds. <cf>It must be pretty hard to mow all this.
I wonder if there is a large infestation somewhere. <cf>I hope I'm not causing a fuss: ......
We raise horses on our ranch. <cf>I've even wholesaled horses to the Bernhardt Knights.
We need hay to raise horses. <cf>But it's cold here, so it's hard to grow plants.
It's a challenge to get large quantities of it. <cf>But there's an awful lot of grass being thrown away every day these days.
They told me I could have it for free. <cf>I'm grateful, but it's a strange story.
Was there even a good harvest? <cf>And even so, it's not like we're going to have a good harvest every day.
I hope it's not a harbinger of something weird.
If you know someone who needs help with plants, <cf>Let's help them!
My name is Guicaro! <cf>I am a new recruit of the glorious Duchy of Bernhardt!
Oh, be in a good mood, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>...... Oh, what's that?　Something different about you. ......
Sorry ....... <cf>I'm trying to talk like a soldier, but I'm not used to it.
Um, actually, I have a request. <cf>Could you please listen to me?
The other day I received a letter from my sister who lives in Kanaloa. <cf> It said, "["]Strange things have been happening lately["].
However, the key ["]weirdness["] is not mentioned in the <cf>
My sister is laid-back and good-natured ....... <cf>I'm not sure what my brother is talking about, but I'm worried about her.
I am on a mission and won't be able to leave the castle for a while. <cf>So I thought I would ask an adventurer to help me.
Could you please check on my sister? <cf>And if possible, see what's causing all the weirdness.
My sister's name is Amia. <cf>I live in Kanaloa, please help me.
Could you please check on my sister in Kanaloa? <cf>She says that ["]strange things ["]have been happening lately.
If possible, please find out the cause of the problem as well. <cf>He's a laid back person and I'm worried about what's going on. ......
My sister's name is Amia. <cf>If I tell you that Guicaro asked me to do this, you will understand, so...
Oh, hello there. Hello, adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
...... Well. At the request of Guicaro? <cf>That's for my brother to take care of.
Guicaro is a kind man and doesn't like to argue, but he became a soldier because it <cf>would make him money.
Wasn't that boy overworked? <cf>She's a total worrier.
Even when I was still little. ...... shouldn't be. <cf>You weren't talking about Guicaro, you were talking about me.
As a matter of fact, there are so many weeds growing in my garden. <cf>And they grow every day.
I keep pulling it out and mowing it down, <cf>but the next day it grows back again.
One of these days, my house is going to be swallowed up by the weeds.
I'm sure there's something causing this, but I don't know how to <cf>find out what it is.
...... Is there a stack at the Pioneer Station in Asterleeds? <cf>Well. I'll see what I can find there.
It would be great if you could go check it out. <cf>Please do, Mr. Adventurer.
I'm having a problem with weeds growing in my yard. <cf>I pull them out, hunt them down, and the next day they're back.
I wonder if there's a reason for this? <cf>Do you know of any old stories like this, adventurers?
I see that there is a stack at the Pioneer Station in Asterleeds. <cf>Could you go check it out there?
Amia asked me to <cf>to find a story about weeds.
There is a tremendous amount of books on "Plants". <cf>It will be hard to find it from here. ......
Hello, adventurer. Hello there. <cf>What are you looking up?
I can help you if you like. <cf>What kind of book are you looking for?
...... hmmm
The weeds grow right back. <cf>Is it going to be back to normal the next day and swallow the house ......
That, I have heard similar stories. <cf>Wait a minute. Let's see... ......
...... Ah, here it is. <cf>It's called "The Cursed Five-Colored Jewel" lore.
'Five different plagues of the ancient world <cf>Five colored gems have been rolling through the world.'
Red gems bring demons. <cf>It brings danger to the land where it is placed."
'Green gems call for plants. <cf>Cover the building in which it is placed with green.'
'When the plague of curses is repelled, <cf>the jewel loses its brilliance.'
'But the power of the curse remains, and <cf>the gems begin to shine again ......'
This is a bit disturbing. <cf>Does the person have a green gemstone?
I'd better check <cf>to see if it rings a bell.
Let's go to <cf>Kanaloa to see if Amia has any green gems!
How did it go, Mr. Adventurer? <cf>I hope you found something in the bookshelves of the Pioneer Station.
There's a ...... cursed green gem that <cf>covers buildings with grass?　Well, tough luck.
Does that ring a bell?　Well, hey ......
Oh, Guicaro bought it for me with his first paycheck. <cf>A beautiful green gem.
Look, here it is. <cf>It's a very beautiful sparkling stone.
What's up with ......? <cf>The colors are so dull.
Oh, maybe. <cf>Maybe it's because I cut the weeds.
So is this the cursed jewel? <cf>Oh, my God, Guicaro.
I wonder if she didn't ask the shopkeeper. <cf>You're such a nosy little girl.
It's a nice gift, but <cf>I can't help it if it's cursed.
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>Could you please deliver this jewelry to Guicaro?
He's a soldier, so tell him to deal with these things <cf>properly, too.
Could you please deliver this green gem to <cf>Guicaro at Bernhardt Castle.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>How was your sister, not ......?
Huh?　My gift of green jewelry is <cf>cursed!
Oh no ....... So I was the cause of the <cf>"weirdness" that your sister mentioned?
Ugh ...... pathetic
Oh, I see that you brought your jewelry as well. <cf>Thank you for going to the trouble.
["]You're a soldier, so you have to deal with these things too <cf>properly ["]....... My sister is right.
You can cover the building with plants at ....... <cf>Then that might help in some places.
Can we prop up abandoned houses so they don't collapse or <cf>even let grass grow in the wasteland?
After thinking about it, I think I can handle it. <cf>I will take care of this jewelry myself ...... No, I will take care of it!
I'm going to try a few things. <cf>Maybe if I talk to my superiors, I'll get more ideas.
Sorry for the inconvenience, adventurer. <cf>Thank you very much for your cooperation!
As for the green gems, <cf>We are discussing a response with the Knights of Columbus as well.
As it happens, finding the gems <cf>got me compliments too!
I will continue to do my best to <cf>not to worry my sister!
Welcome! <cf>I've come up with another new bento for you.
I took a cue from the cold regions. <cf>I wanted to create a menu that would warm you up.
The main one is <cf>"Large Onor Chestnuts" from the West Bernhardt Peninsula!
I want to use it, but there's one problem. <cf>I'd love to use it, but there's just one problem.
They don't have it in the Asterleeds store and I don't have a <cf>supplier.
It's a bit of an expensive vegetable. <cf>It doesn't seem to sell very well.
That's why I wanted to geek out by putting <cf>a lot of it in our lunches!
10 <cf>"Large Onor Chestnuts" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>"!
Go gather them up in a jiffy. <cf>Thank you!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>" and collect 10 <cf>"Large Onor Chestnuts".
He wants to make a geeky bento. <cf>I asked him to do it!
Oh, what a magnificent "large onol chestnut"! <cf>Thank you. They must have been heavy.
When steamed with seafood, <cf>it absorbs the broth and tastes delicious.
The smell alone is enough to get everyone hooked! <cf>This should make a good lunch.
I'm sure I can get some rare ingredients if I ask Anta to help me. <cf>If I ever need anything else, I'll ask for your help!
Bernhardt has some interesting ingredients <cf>You can find all kinds of things!
I'm starting to get interested in other places. <cf>Let me know if you find any unusual ingredients.
I heard about the baboon ....... <cf>I heard you got access to the Duchy of Bernhardt.
Thanks to you, <cf>, my job just got a lot easier. Thank you.
Baboon ....... And of course, making makeover potions. <cf>I have materials that I couldn't get before.
You know the Machina? <cf>I need the drive fluid used in that thing.
To be precise, it's 'soil with sinking drive solution'. <cf>When you mix it, you mix it with the soil anyway.
It's a pain in the ass to break the machina and get it, isn't it? <cf>Baboon ....... I'll hold off on the dirt.
That and the "rotten twisted shells" found on the Coast. <cf>You know, the rotten ones?
Fresh twisted clams make a good broth. <cf>I have other uses for the rotten ones, baboon.
You should be able to pick it up around " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". <cf>Thanks in advance, baboon baboon baboon ......
Get me five "Driven Liquid Sinking Soil" and ten <cf>"Rotten Twisted Shells."
Try <cf>to find " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>" in West Bernhardt Peninsula. Nice to meet you, baboon. ......
Did you find the material I asked for?　Baboon......
The "rotten twisted shells" in the "sinking soil of the driving fluid". <cf>Perfect. That's what I'm talking about.
Ah, it's a fragrant scent. <cf>I think I can make a good concoction, baboon baboon baboon.
Thank you. <cf>Now I'm one step closer to making a makeover potion.
Hmm?　...... Oh, right. <cf>Didn't I tell you why I'm making a makeover potion?
It's not about making money. <cf>With my skills, I can make a good living as a concoctor.
Baboon ....... Well, please give me a break. <cf>I'm not trying to abuse it.
I'll let you know when it's finished. <cf>So help me out again. Nice to meet you, baboon. ......
Baboon ....... <cf>If you could transform into anyone, what would you do?
Well, it depends on who you're talking to. <cf>I can imagine a lot of things. ......
There are some people in the world who can't be saved by ...... medicine. <cf> Hee-hee-hee......
Oh, Anta. <cf>You're always good to me. Thanks.
I'm trying to recreate a 400 year old weapon manufacturing process, <cf>, by researching this and that.
Well, there are so many things I don't understand. <cf>The way we do things is so different from the way we do craft now.
Instead, it looks like they can make <cf>quality weapons, which is different from crafting.
One of the clues is a record called <cf>["]Fusion of ore and biological tissue ["]"].
["]Steel plates with the suppleness of muscle ["] <cf>were actually made and used, I'm told!
I don't know what it's all about, but <cf>as a blacksmith, it's an intriguing story.
So. <cf>I've been looking around to see if I could at least get a sample.
You know the Machina of the Duchy of Bernhardt? <cf>They say an armored version of it is being built with the same idea in mind.
There should be a stray <cf>Makina Fox hanging out in "Castle Shadows."
Can you go to <cf>and pick up five "Machina Armor Samples"?
Also, I would like to ask you for an ore called "ice-piercing iron". <cf>This can be found at the Rauleben Battlefield.
I'd like to see both together. <cf>I know it's a lot of work, but please do.
Get me 5 "Machina Armor Samples" and 20 <cf>"Ice Piercing Irons".
The "Machina Armored Sample" is at <cf>You need to take down the Machina Fox.
The "piercing ice iron" should be found in the ore extraction.
Makina Fox, look for "Castle Shadows" and <cf>"Piercing Ice Iron" look for "Rauleben Battlefield".
Sorry for the hassle. <cf>It's nice to meet you.
Oh, Anta! <cf>You brought me the material I asked for.
I've got "Machina's Armored Sample" and "Ice Piercing Iron." <cf>I received them for sure. Thanks a lot.
Well, let's find out what's going on!
...... hmm?　No, this could be it. <cf>Are we supposed to be looking into Bernhardt's military secrets?
...... It's okay, maybe. <cf>It's a wild machina, and I'm just using it as a reference.
...... Can you keep it under wraps, just in case?
Machina's armor moves well at the joints. <cf>But the metal itself is hard and solid.
["]Steel plate with muscular suppleness ["] <cf>It's a different impression. ......
This is an interesting creation, but <cf>seems to have a different take on the 400 year old process
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>or ....... <cf>I didn't know those ferocious people attacked livestock.
It is a heavy load for a novice adventurer. <cf>A veteran like me will have to step up to the plate.
If someone says ["]for the sake of the livestock["] and <cf>carelessly messes with them, it's dangerous.
Are you an adventurer too? My name is Guyler. <cf>I'm an adventurer based in Kanaloa.
Even though it looks this way, I've been doing this for a long time. <cf>I guess you could say I'm a veteran.
You seem to be pretty good at it too. <cf>But I'm still not as good as you. Ha ha ha!
Now, about this request. <cf>I'm afraid we're going to have a bit of a tricky partner.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>The company is a subsidiary of the National Association of State Boards of Education (NACS). You know what it is? <cf>I'm a veteran, but I'm also a vicious monster who can be a handful.
I heard these guys are herding and attacking livestock.
They are formidable opponents, but they cannot be left alone. <cf>The damage is spreading little by little.
If someone says ["]it's for the livestock[,]" <cf>and you carelessly touch it, it's dangerous.
Let's go talk to people in the village first. <cf>Hopefully someone who knows livestock. ......
Livestock are being affected by <value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>
Let's go talk to people in the village. <cf>It would be helpful to have someone who knows livestock.
Oh, the kind adventurer who helped the chickens and cows <cf>!
Now you are going to help the pigs! <cf>Thank you!
And you are? <cf>You don't seem to be a resident of Kanaloa: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>I heard that the "Mere Old Man" bullied the pigs!
It's terrible!　It is unforgivable! <cf>It is truly the work of an animal that is no better than a pig!
I still need to take down Dire Howl.
Yes! <cf>Let's split up and take them down 20 at a time!
Two, twenty of them! <cf>Wait a minute. That number is indeed ......
Because he bullied the pigs, right? <cf>You must be punished!
It's nothing like 20 bodies! <cf>They tell you the line that should not be crossed!
<value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>The - the - unforgivable!
Damn ......, I have no choice. <cf>I'll go with you, Elsie.
You manage to take down 20 of them. <cf>If you manage to kill that many, you should be fine.
I'll take care of Elsie. <cf>As a veteran adventurer, I will protect you!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>Let's take down 20 of them! <cf>It's for the pigs!
<value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/><span size="Big">The - the - unforgivable! &lt;/&gt;
...... Oh, it's you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>I'm glad you made it to the end.
Twenty, huh? You did a great job. <cf>You're still very good at what you do. ......
Hey ....... Have you ever seen 'genius'? <cf>I'd say the 'real one' ......
If I had to use a metaphor, I would say yes. ......
While I finally take down one <value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>, <cf>it's a bullwhip-wielding storm that's turned 19 bodies into blood smoke and pieces of meat!
Ah, adventurers! <cf>Thank you for your hard work in defeating Dire Howl!
Even the pigs were happy. <cf>You are indeed a strong adventurer!
My accumulated experience is nothing but an empty sandcastle in front of the <cf>"real thing" ......
I've come to realize: ....... <cf>That there are heights in the world that are out of reach.
Thank you Gailer for your help. <cf>Thank you for taking down just one of them!
Elsie. You are the 'real deal'! <cf>You deserve to be the head of Kanaloa.
I hope you will be an adventurer to the fullest!
Huh?　Ya.
<span size="Big">Why not! &lt;/&gt;
I know it! <cf>Those reddened hands are the sign of a true strong man!
This is the blood of the pig I just slaughtered! <cf>Please don't say it like it's some weird thing!
Fighting monsters is scary, isn't it? <cf>I definitely don't want to be an adventurer!
Even after showing so much ability, <cf>you're still on the lookout for monsters. ......
After all, you are the "real deal"! <cf>You are an adventurer among adventurers!
With everything I have, <cf>I will make you the best adventurer I can!
If it's "Ya", it's "Ya"! <cf>I am a butcher!
I will never become an adventurer!
Damn, I lost Mr. Elsie. <cf>That's how you carry yourself.
I'll do whatever it takes to convince you, Elsie. <cf>I'll put everything I have as a veteran adventurer on the line!
Ah ...... adventurer ....... Hello.
You helped me with making soup for my wedding celebration. <cf>Do you remember?　Thank you for that occasion.
I had a fiancée. <cf>We were going to get married when he came back.
I'm an adventurer named Yoan. <cf>I've been to Montegnor Valley on a request. ......
...... the other day, a friend of Yoan's named <cf>delivered his bandana to me.
A rather rough-looking guy named Girsch. <cf>He kept apologizing over and over again.
Yoan defended Mr. Girsch and <cf>into a pack of monsters ......
Only the bandana was found, but <cf>Yoan's whereabouts remain unknown. ......
Adventurers, please. <cf>Please find Yoan.
I want to believe that Yoan is safe. <cf>But if something happens to him, you can contact me at ......
Whatever the ...... outcome, <cf>I just want to get the facts straight.
Maybe Litze can find someone who knows how to trace Yoan's steps to <cf>.
Yoan was not only doing the work he was asked to do, but he was also <cf>taking on the job of escorting and assisting the merchants.
So I always came home late. <cf>But I liked that about him.
...... not something to talk about in the past tense just yet. <cf>Adventurer. Please, please, please.
I need you to find an adventurer named Yoan. <cf>I think I know someone in Litze who knows where he's going.
I want to believe he is safe. ...... <cf>Please, Mr. Adventurer.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Can I help you?
Are you looking for someone from ......? <cf>Oh, you must be Yoan?
Oh, by the way, I failed to ask your name. <cf>I met an adventurer in the mountains the other day.
I was attacked by a monster and <cf>saved me.
He seemed to be in a great hurry and went <cf>deep into the mountains again!
Yes, yes! <cf>I gave him a bandana of goods in return.
I heard that he lost the one he was using. <cf>I thought I could at least do that.
I'm glad you are the Yoan you are looking for! <cf>I can thank you properly later too!
Joanne was looking for something, so she went to <cf>( <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>)
If you see him, please give him my best regards. <cf>The merchant was very grateful, and
Joanne, you're looking for <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>.
I heard you were looking for something important. <cf>I think he's still in the mountains.
Can we get closer to it from here: ......
...... hmm?　What about you?
Sorry. I was looking for something. <cf>I didn't notice until you called out to me.
My name is Yoan. <cf>I'm an adventurer, as you can see.
What, you were looking for me?
Well, Katya is at ....... <cf>Sorry about that.
I'm always late getting home, so <cf>I just neglected to contact you.
Of course I would be worried if I received only a bandana. <cf>And I feel bad for Girsch.
I know. I'll be home soon. <cf>But first, I really need to do something.
I'm trying to get my <cf>leather bag back from the Mooks around here who took it from me.
I have to bring that one back. <cf>You, while you're at it, give me a hand.
I know who took the leather bag. <cf>But it's a tough herd. We're having a tough time.
I need you to kick the crap out of my minions <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/>. <cf>15 of them, and I'd appreciate it if you could take them down.
They will be confused and lose control. <cf>I'll take the leather bag back from the head while they're at it.
I suggest you guys split up. <cf>I'll meet you at the Litze when you're done.
I'll see you later. See you later.
I was worried about Katya and I was worried about Girsch. <cf>I'll bow out properly when I get back.
But first, I really need to get back the leather bag that the Mooks took from me <cf>
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>" and take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/>.
Meanwhile, I'll get the leather bag back from the master. <cf>We'll meet up at Litze when we're done.
Hey, I've been waiting for you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/>Thanks for taking down those bastards!
I also got my leather bag back in one piece. <cf>Thanks to your coming.
It's "Crescent Mushroom" inside. Do you know what they are? <cf>It's a rare mushroom that's almost impossible to find nowadays.
And it's an essential ingredient in the <cf>celebratory wedding soup made by Katya's dead mother.
For her, it's a taste of irreplaceable memories. <cf>So I really wanted to bring it home.
I was desperate because if I missed this one, I might never get another <cf>
But if I made you worry for that, I don't care. <cf>I must go home soon and apologize.
You're going to report to Katya, too, right? <cf>Then I'll go with you.
Stay with me a little longer until we get back to Minsterhorn <cf>
Let's go back to Katya. <cf>I've caused you to worry.
You'll be back to report, won't you? <cf>I'll come with you to Minsterhorn.
Welcome back, adventurer!
It can be found at ......
Yoan!　So you're Yoan. ...... <cf>Thank God you're ...... safe!
I'm sorry, Katya. <cf>I'm sorry I worried you.
It's okay. If you came back ......
Thanks to this man's help, we got this guy back from the Mooks. <cf>We got this guy back from the Mooks.
This ...... no way, crescent mushrooms!
I was lucky enough to get it. <cf>I really wanted to get it to Katya.
Celebratory wedding soup. You said you'd be able to make <cf>it by the time I got back.
Yes, I did. I practiced a lot. <cf>That's what I've been doing with the help of this adventurer.
Excuse me?
Well, you even took care of Katya. ...... <cf>I can't thank you enough for all you've done for us.
We both owe you a debt of gratitude. <cf>It's been a real pleasure meeting you.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>We all owe you a lot.
If you ever stop by Minsterhorn, <cf>, show your face anytime.
I'll treat you to an abundance of delicious food. <cf>You are more than welcome!
Thank you so much. <cf>You owe me and Katya a lot.
I also apologized to Girsch. <cf>He was crying like crazy.
It's not good to worry about the people you care about. <cf>I'm sure you'll be fine, but don't do anything reckless.
That is why I have been pursuing a certain person for many years. <cf>He is the one to whom I must fulfill my innermost desire. ......
I have prepared a "proof" with all my heart and soul. <cf>All that remained was to confront him with his long-held feelings!
Wait and see ......!　You'll never get away with this. ......
Oh, you are a skilled adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your help the other day.
Thank you <cf>for your efforts to create a "testimonial" that shows the heart and soul of our company.
Thanks to you, I was able to form a "testimony" that I am not ashamed of. <cf>I am truly grateful.
There is someone with whom I must settle the <cf>matter.
This "testimony" is what makes his/her <cf>will known.
This is the game of a lifetime! <cf>I ask you to be present.
And one more thing. Sorry to take up so much of your time, but <cf>could you bring that guy here?
I have my own obsession with it. ...... <cf>I want to keep my mind sharp until I meet that one face to face.
The other party is an adventurer named Durga. <cf> He said he had business with ["]Khartoum ["].
I entrust you with a letter of my own. <cf>Please do me the favor.
......Fu, at last. <cf>You won't get away with this anymore, Durga. ......
In the "Khartoum Ruins" <cf>there should be an adventurer named Durga.
He is the one to whom I must fulfill my destiny. <cf>I am sorry, but could you bring him here?
That's what I want to keep my mind sharp ....... <cf>I won't let you get away with it anymore, Durga. ......
Hmm?　What is it, you? <cf>Ryuk is asking for my favor?
You took the trouble to write me a letter. <cf>Thanks. Let's see. ......
Dear Mr. Durga. <cf>I would like to settle our relationship.
It's fair and square, one on one. <cf>It's a once-in-a-lifetime fight for life.
'I beg you not to run away from me, not even for a moment. <cf>I beg you not to disappoint me.
-- what does ...... mean? <cf>What the hell is this guy up to?
Ryuk's guy ......! <cf>He sent me a letter of fulfillment!
Fine, I hope so. ...... <cf>I'll Accept!
Let's settle this! <cf>I'll tell you who you've picked a fight with!
Just as well, you'll see! <cf>Who won, me or Ryuk?
Come on, let's go to Salamzart! <cf>Ryuk, wash your neck and wait for me!
That Ryuk guy! <cf>You've got some nerve to pick a fight with me!
[I want to settle this, huh? <cf>I want to!
You'll see to it! <cf>Come on, let's go to Salamzart, shall we?
Here you are: ...... Durga!
Ryuk!　Your destiny is limited to today!
Durga. You are the first warrior who thought it was <cf>okay to entrust your back to ......
Yeah, me too. <cf>I still liked you.
With you, <cf>we can overcome any hardship!
I agree. You and I have no enemies. <cf>That's what I thought. ......
I swear to you that I will have your back for the rest of my life!
I believed in you!
Please join me as a companion <cf>and follow the path of the warrior with me!
So why should we fight. ......
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
What are you talking about? <cf>Ryuk, what's up with the matchmaking?
You've been talking about it with a lot of fervor ...... since a while ago. <cf>You sound like that ...... proposal.
What else is there to say? <cf>I don't know anything about a duel.
Now, take this sword. <cf>It is the "proof" of the oath I made.
I thought it was a ...... ring?　In a situation like this.
Yes, it was the material of a finger ring, but I broke it. <cf>So I made it part of the pattern by force.
It's not impossible to remove, but you can do so at ....... <cf>Not strong enough to protect your fingers, huh?
............ pfft ......! <cf>Hahaha, ahahahaha!
Haha ...... funny! <cf>You people are really fast-paced!
I can't help it. I'll take it from ......
Oh oh oh ...... Durga!
I could not be happier! <cf>This is the best day in my lifetime!
Dear Adventurer!　I am grateful! <cf>I have made my oath, and you have seen to it that I keep it!
I cannot thank you enough, Ryuk! <cf>You will be my friend for life!
I'm sorry for taking care of you. <cf>I thank you too. Thank you.
He's a bit of a jerk, but he's not a bad guy. <cf>Take care of my husband again.
Dear Adventurer!　Is everything all right? <cf>I'm glad you're all right.
My wife, Durga, sends her regards to <cf>
We pray that your path will be open to you as well. <cf>We both pray for you!
Hey, hey, ...... what a mediocre blueprint! <cf>You want me to carve these boring stone statues?
Should I follow my client here? <cf>No, my soul doesn't want that!
Seek the wild! <cf>Feel it, the shout that resonates from your soul!
I'm so glad you came! <cf>I'm Aurelie, the wild soul sculptor!
Accepted a commission from the Duchy of Bernhardt to create <cf>a statue of a knight.
<span size="Big">Oooooohhhh, it's going to burn! &lt;/&gt;
I'm already inspired! <cf>He is the only one who can respond to my soul!
I saw a rockin' monster at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>'! <cf>It's a crab spider called " <value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>"!
Decorate the knight statue with his scissors! <cf>This will be a revolutionary masterpiece!
I thought about going to ......, but the guy in charge said no. <cf>The guy in charge told me no.
Don't do anything extra <cf>and build it according to this boring blueprint, he said.
The prestige of the Order of Bernhardt is nonsense, <cf>tradition and prestige is crap ......
<span size="Big">Shut up! &lt;/&gt;
I'm not giving up! <cf>I'm going to convince that old man!
I need you to do the normal material gathering for now. <cf>I'll need rocks as well as scissors.
Collect <cf>"angular gray marble" from " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>"
Come back here when you're done. <cf>I'll try to convince the old man in charge in the meantime!
Hold on, old man! <cf>I'll bring out your soul shout!
I'll convince the old man in charge while I'm at it! <cf>Come back here when you're done.
After that, you've been waiting! <cf>I'm getting the scissors from " <value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>"!
Oh, good job! <cf>I'm looking for "angular gray marble". Thanks!
Hold on a second. <cf>Because I called the guy in charge!
What do you think, old man? <cf>We got some good rocks. All that's left is to make a decision!
Hmmm, but... ......
Are you really happy with this blueprint! <cf>Can you tell how amazing the Knights of Bernhardt are!
I don't think so. <cf>Your power ...... is not this kind of soul!
Bernhardt's soul should be even greater and hotter! <cf>Even the dragon tribe will be blown to the ends of the sky!
Mwah!　You're absolutely right!
The pride, dignity and passion of our Order! <cf>It is not something that can be fully expressed in words.
Then let's express everything! <cf>That's the best way to get the crowd going, right?
Of course, if you can do it, great! <cf>Can you do it, Aurélie?
It's not about what you can or can't do, <span size="Big">it's about what you will do! &lt;/&gt;
Your souls, your boiling souls!　Your cries! <cf>Let's put it all in the knight statue!
<span size="Big">Woohoo!　Okay, let's do it! &lt;/&gt;
Let the roar of our souls <cf>roar to every corner of the Principality of Bernhardt!
We've got a deal! <cf>I'll make you the most soulful statue of a knight ever!
All you need is "Wild Crab Scissors"! <cf>Go to " <value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>" and get them!
If you're in " <value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>", you should be in " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>"! <cf>I'm counting on you, adventurers who know wild souls!
I'm the rockin' crab spider at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>! <cf>They will surely respond to our wild spirit!
I see you got the "Wild Crab Scissors"! <cf>That's what I'm talking about, thanks!
Wow!　It's really wild to see it up close! <cf>I'm so excited!
I see! <cf>This wild pair of scissors will make you proud to be a knight: ......
...... is a little too flashy, don't you think?
It's too late for that now! <cf>I'm in front of the crab scissors and nothing can stop me!
Trust me, old man! <cf>I promise I will make you the best knighthood ever!
Yes, we did! <cf>We made sure our souls shouted to each other!
Aurélie! <cf>You'll be in good hands!
...... no problem, right? <cf>You're not going to get upset with the higher ups, are you?
I'm going to start working on the knight statue! <cf>Thanks to you!　Thanks wildly!
<span size="Big">Come on, let's carve, carve, carve! &lt;/&gt;
Hoo ...... another masterpiece of my soul has been born!
Shouting knight wearing a crab-snout helmet. <cf>It's so wild, you'll be bowled over!
Don't worry! <cf>The next new product will do well!
Where did you always get that confidence from ....... <cf>Aren't you going to make something weird again?
It's not weird! <cf>Call it individuality and originality!
Yay, adventurers! <cf>Welcome to the new product development of inventors Anne &amp; Shea!
I'm just involved. <cf>Please don't make me sound like the ringleader with you.
Thank you <cf>for the poisoned accessories. Mr. Adventurer.
How to say!　I just used Venomine, <cf>I didn't plant poison in the accessories!
If you sold it to the assassin, <cf>it might have worked, Anne.
Oh, I see. <cf>That's what I thought!　You've got a good eye!
I don't even listen to sarcasm. ......
So, here's what's new today!
Salamzart is very dry, right? <cf>Your skin gets chapped easily.
So I'm thinking of making a hand cream. <cf>I've already thought of a catchphrase.
'Even desert skin is an instant oasis!' <cf>I think it will definitely sell!
It's a straight forward idea for Anne. <cf>Do you have a bait for good material?
For ......?
Cojones, I'm glad you asked! <cf>It's the desert creatures I've got my eye on.
The name is <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>!
They are in the desert all the time, but their body hair is shiny! <cf>I'm sure there's something in their hair that makes them resistant to dryness.
Huh?　No, <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>'s hair is ......
So, collect <cf>"bristles that withstand dryness" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"!
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>You can get it at <cf>if you take down the
After all, you're messing with monsters. ......
Excuse me, adventurer. <cf>Five "bristles that stand the test of dryness," please.
Please use " <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>" to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>
You should be able to get "bristles that withstand dryness." <cf>Collect about five of them!
I'm sorry Anne is bothering you. <cf>She's so reckless right off the bat. ......
Ah, adventurer, welcome back! <cf>Did you get "Bristly Hair That Stands Up to Dryness"?
You have aligned as requested. <cf>Thank you, Mr. Adventurer.
You can make hand cream with it! <cf>We'll market it under the Anne &amp; Shea brand.Â
If you cut it into small pieces, grind it up, and extract the <cf>fat component, you can get the ......
...... Huh?　 <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>s hair is stiff? <cf>It's more like stiff or ...... stumpy?
They have many natural enemies in the desert. <cf>They've evolved hard body hair to protect themselves.
If you use a bad knife or blunt instrument, <cf>you'll ruin your tools!
In the past, this hair was even processed to make armor.
No, no, no, no matter how hard it is, it's still hair, okay? <cf>It's easy to do something like this ......kku......ginununununununununununu......
Nugu ...... Ugi ...... <span size="Big">Gee ...... Nuoh ......&lt;/&gt;
Oh no, it doesn't bend at all. <cf>What, am I holding an iron rod?
Adventurer. Thank you <cf>for being so selfish Anne!
I don't think the idea is bad. <cf>The way you did it was still Anne.
I'll just tell them to make <cf>regular products from vegetable and livestock oils[--].
If this happens, it's the last resort! <cf>I think it would work if I bit it!　Gulp!
Hey, ...... What are you doing, Anne! <cf>Let me out!　It's dirty and dangerous!
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>There are monsters out there <cf>that eat the "Mere Old Man," so it's not like you can't bite off more than you can chew!
You wouldn't eat <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>! <cf>Go ahead, petch it!　Peck!
It's creaking......! <cf>It's creaking ...... a little bit ......!　My jaw.
Your face is changing! <cf>Anne!　Open your mouth ...... hey ......!
<span size="Big">Stop it ...... stop it! &lt;/&gt;
You can't chew through <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>hair with human power. <cf>Then let's get a sand viper to do it!
Do you want to be swallowed whole?
It's okay!　I'm just asking for a little help!
Come to your senses, Anne! <cf>Stop it ...... stop it!
Yi-chan~. <cf>Where is our Yi-chan~?
...... those guys, I couldn't reply. <cf>Oh, I'm so tired!
Hey, Yi-chan~! <cf>I'll give you an Engram.
...... Kyu~......
I've run out of engrams. <cf>e has been turned over.
......a~......
It fell into the water and just went away. ......
Maybe there is someone out there looking for it. <cf>I'll let you know if I know of anyone.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Have you seen the upturned ee-chan?
I'm looking for e-chan for some reason. <cf>I can't find her at all. I'm so tired and sluggish.
Did you see ......?　Yay~! <cf>Finally found a clue!
Thank you very much. <cf>In addition, could you take care of one thing for me?
I'm sorry. <cf>I'm sorry for asking you to do something so tedious.
We have a lot of Bapharia's heritage in our master's villa <cf>
And for that stable operation, <cf>I've also kept a lot of eechanes.
There are lots of other cats, dogs, nappies, <cf>everything.
Rich people don't know the difference between "good" and "bad". <cf>I wish they knew how hard it is to manage.
Oh, I'm sorry. <cf>I was too lazy to blurt it out.
Those ee-chan have gone out of the <cf>mansion.
Maybe he ran out of engrams there and <cf>never came back.
Those little guys, when they run out of engrams, <cf>they turn over and get stuck.
Even humans are like that when they're tired, right? <cf>Ee-chan is no different.
So we need to recover Ee-chan from <cf>
If you see Ee-chan flipped upside down on the street, can you <cf>catch him and bring him to us?
There are several of them. <cf>Go find one for now!
As I said, we don't go out into the desert, so if you can find us at <cf>in Salamzart, we'll be fine.
I'll look around the neighborhood too, please. <cf>I'm really tired of this~!
I think somewhere in Salamzart there is a <cf>upturned eechan.
I know you are our Ee, so can you please collect her <cf>and bring her here?
I'm so lazy about the cat thing! <cf>Sorry. I'm looking forward to working with you.
I found an upturned ee.
There is no response when I poke it. <cf>I think I'm running out of engrams.
I'll deliver it to Tini.
Ahhh, thank you for your help. <cf>Did you find Ee, too, over there?
Turned upside down? <cf>That's exactly what it is. That's it.
Which one is ....... Yeah, it's the same as this one. <cf>I guess I'm still out of engrams.
Thank you very much. <cf>From the looks of it, it doesn't appear to be broken anywhere.
I'm sorry then. <cf>Can you find the other eechan?
I think Ee-chan is so curious that she gets into <cf>weird places!
Maybe behind a rock or under a table. <cf>Behind the tent ...... No, I doubt it's above the tent.
I'll stay here and keep an eye on Ee-chan. <cf>If he wakes up suddenly and goes away, he'll be lazy.
If we can coordinate well, <cf>we might be able to get you back to the mansion on your own.
Excuse me, please.
I'm sure there are still some Ee-chan's in Salamzart that have run out of engrams <cf>
They may be on top of a tent or under a table. <cf>Please find them in strange places.
I will try to fix this ko and others here. <cf>I'm sorry. Thank you very much.
I found a broken ee of engrams.
Once we collect everything, we'll deliver it to Tini.
Wow, adventurer. Thank you. <cf>I'm glad you all found us.
It's really helpful. I really appreciate it. <cf>I would have been really tired if it weren't for you.
Hinofu only...... <cf>One more body seems to be missing?
Oh, it's that girl! <cf>Adventurer. Did you get a look at the water?
I have an ee that loves to go in the water. <cf>Of course, she can't swim, so she sinks.
...... the first co I saw fell into the water and drifted away? <cf>Ah, that's it. I'm pretty sure that's it.
Excuse me, could you please go and retrieve the last one, <cf>
I can't just leave them submerged in an oasis. <cf>I'm really tired of it.
I think there is one more ee-chan, so could you please go to <cf>and retrieve it.
She can't swim, but she likes to get in the water. <cf>I think she's sinking in an oasis!
I have to wipe the water off, I'm so lazy! <cf>No, if I leave it alone, will it dry up?
I found Yee sinking to the bottom of the oasis. <cf>She looks mindlessly content.
We'll collect it and deliver it to Tini.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Did you find the last ee-chan?
Ahhhhhh, soaked to the skin!
Was it still sunk in an oasis? <cf>You're so dynamic at your own pace!
I'm sure this Ee-chan will be a big deal in the future. <cf>But I hope it will be somewhere that has nothing to do with me.
Anyway, thank you very much. <cf>I've got everything here.
Oh, it was sluggish. I'm already sweating. <cf>I feel like taking a dip in the oasis too.
I guess I'll go home then~. <cf>By the way, Ee-chan is surprisingly big, isn't she?
How do I bring it back home? ....... <cf>Oh, geez. I'm tired just thinking about it~!
But still, isn't it too hot in this city <cf>?
Master, can't you supply me with summer clothes or something~!
Special training is underway to strengthen the security force!
It's too lukewarm for the troops to fight each other. <cf>Throw them in a dungeon and give them hands-on training against monsters.
I feel like it's too late to come back. ...... <cf>Well, it'll be fine!
Oh, it's you! <cf>You've come to the right place.
I'm making an example out of you, <cf>and I'm training my men in security very well.
The goal is to kill 1,000 monsters per person! <cf>The goal is for each player to kill 1,000 monsters!
I'm trying to protect this big city. <cf>You have to be able to do that!
I was thinking .......
There was a newcomer who got isolated in a dangerous area. <cf>It's a shame, but there were people in need of rescue.
I'm told that I should take care of myself. <cf>However, if I don't help them, my men will die.
That's why I'm asking you to help me rescue them.
The place is the "Ballroom of the Water Fairy". <cf>You go on a rampage and attract the monsters.
And the bad guy at the far end of the room, I'm going to blow him away!
In the meantime, we'll rescue your men. <cf>You just leave everything else to us.
Sorry for the hassle. <cf>I'll be looking forward to working with you!
Step on the "Ballroom of the Water Fairy" and <cf>kick those monsters to the curb!
In the meantime, I'm going to rescue my men who have become isolated. <cf>Sorry for the trouble!　Please do!
Hey, good job! <cf>Thanks for getting me all riled up.
Thanks to you, I was able to rescue my men. <cf>Don't worry. I'm fine.
That's right. ....... <cf>They can still afford it, right?
You're not pushing hard enough, are you? <cf>Don't you think so?　Don't you think so?
Damn it, what I did. <cf>I was too quick to save you.
Well, whatever! <cf>You're a real piece of work, you know that?
Are you still interested in joining the guard? <cf>You are always welcome!
Let me know when you're ready. <cf>Let's work through those bean sprouts together!
It's not a good idea to have people in need of rescue during training.
It's not right to rely on rescue services in the first place. <cf>You just have to do something about it yourself.
That's right!　Okay, I'm going to go to the next training exercise! <cf>Let's go with no rescue for the next training, no matter if we get lost or not!
I got to open the store I've always wanted. <cf>Come on, I'm growing my brand.
Watch! <cf>Asterleeds, the city of fashion!
Hey there, adventurer. Hello, adventurer.
I opened the brand new store I've always wanted. <cf>You've been a great help to me, Mr. Adventurer.
The store is doing great, but I'm not satisfied yet. <cf>But I'm not going to be satisfied just yet.
Our goal is to become the world's number one brand! <cf>To achieve this, we still need to increase our name recognition.
That's when I turned to <cf>, an upcoming fashion contest.
It's called the "Trima Awards. <cf>It's a contest sponsored by a certain baron.
It is also famous as a gateway to success for new designers. <cf>Many brands have made a name for themselves after winning.
So this time, I am the brilliant Grand Prix winner!
Of course, winning isn't easy. <cf>You have to make the best dress and take on the challenge!
So, please stay with us until the dress is finished!
I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do. <cf>I'm going to incorporate Bernhardt's style and push for an exotic feel.
I need you to gather the materials for the dress. <cf>I want to make sure it's from Bernhardt, too.
The first one is "Fossilized Peach-colored Coral" from which an elegant dye can be obtained. <cf>You should be able to collect it at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>".
Then there is "Hult Cotton", a supple, high quality cotton. <cf>This one is collected at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>" and
Actually, I'm having a hard time deciding on the last one. ...... <cf>Anyway, bring me those two first.
Once you actually see the material, you'll get some inspiration! <cf>For inspiration's sake, good material, please!
First, you'll need to gather two materials. <cf>Both can be found on the West Bernhardt Peninsula.
You can find "Peach Coral Fossils" at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/><cf> by collecting the minerals.
The "Halt Cotton" is from <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>. <cf>You should be able to get this one by collecting plants.
Because you can find quality stuff. <cf>I'll look forward to seeing you!
Good work! <cf>You've been gathering materials for us.
Yes, it's a nice "peach coral fossil"! <cf>It's a much prettier pink than I thought it would be.
Harte Cotton" is also the best! <cf>It's so soft and soothing to the touch.
Good. Very good! <cf>Here it comes, here comes the inspiration!
I've got an idea, a last-ditch effort! <cf>Let's use the "large flintstone."
Spheneite is a stone often used in jewelry. <cf>Its bright red glow is very beautiful.
But if the stones are too big, it's hard to use <cf>because of the stinky coloring.
But with my dress, I can make the most of it! <cf>You'll have a one-of-a-kind sparkle!
The intense red of "large flashing red stones" on a pale pink base. <cf>It is sure to look great!
Okay, I'll start finishing up! <cf>You go find the "large flint stone"!
You should be able to mine at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>" on the West Bernhardt Peninsula. Please do!
Large flints can be found at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>on the West Bernhardt Peninsula.
This is the last thing I need for my dress. <cf>Nice to meet you!
You found me a "large flintstone". <cf>Thank you!
Yes, it's very good!　Perfect!
I am so glad I asked for you! <cf>I knew you were a good judge of character!
Now I'm all set. <cf>Now all I have to do is put all the skills I have into it.
Wait for it, Trima Award!
I think the contest will be a tough fight. <cf>And we get talented designers from all over the world.
But my best work would definitely win! <cf>You helped me do it. I won't lose!
We're going to bring a breath of fresh air to the fashion world and <cf>steal all the awards and buzz!
<cf>dressmaking is going well for the Trima Awards....
I will definitely win the Grand Prix! <cf>It's the first step for my brand to shine!
The oasis water is <cf>a lifeline for the people of Salamzart.
I have to check it every day like this. <cf>If there are any abnormalities, we have to take action immediately.
Thank you for accepting my request. <cf>I am the one who manages this oasis.
In fact, there has been a strange odor in the oasis since the other day. <cf>It's very slight, though, and hasn't caused any real damage yet.
It appears to be the smell of a monster. <cf>Same thing has happened to me before.
That time, the monster's bodily fluids mixed in with the water and <cf>caused quite a commotion!
Water is still safe to use. <cf>But if it gets any dirtier, that could be a problem.
I want to take steps before that happens.
The cause was investigated in a previous disturbance. <cf>It's an old oasis in the "Khartoum Ruins."
It's connected to this place through a deep underground water vein.
If the water at the ruins gets polluted, <cf>it will affect the oasis over here.
I will now go to the "Khartoum Ruins" <cf>to survey the old oasis and preserve the environment.
I need your help with that.
The old oasis was near <cf>"Kartoum Sandway."
The monster over there is an obstacle to work. <cf>And they seem to be getting more active lately.
Could you please do the "Kartoum Sandway, Additional Survey" and wipe out the <cf>monsters.
In the meantime, I'll clean up the oasis. <cf>If all goes well, come back here.
I need you to do the "Kartoum Sandway, Additional Survey" and wipe out the <cf>monsters.
In the meantime, I'll be preserving the oasis. <cf>When you're done, come back here.
Hey, thanks for your time. <cf>How did you like "Kartoum Sandway"?
Hmmm ...... I knew it was full of monsters. <cf>I was right to hire you.
It has made my work easier. <cf>This oasis is back to normal. I appreciate it.
The old oasis was in terrible shape. <cf>The overabundance of monsters must have ravaged it.
And since I've been hearing about Avaritia, <cf>it seems there are more and more monsters in the desert.
This will do for the time being. <cf>Let's see what we can do to prepare for the future.
Oasis is the life of the city, and I am proud to keep it safe. <cf>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for protecting both of them.
Inspection results show no abnormalities. <cf>Oasis water is perfect today.
You should go and quench your thirst too. <cf>Must be tough traveling in the desert, right?
Coin-operated pavilions are so cozy!
It's a great place to hang out with friends. <cf>Isn't that kind of place precious?
Yo, adventurer. <cf>I have a favor to ask you.
We've been making hangouts here and there among our friends. <cf>Coin-tei is one of them.
The hangout on Bernhardt's side. <cf>It's a little bit out of commission right now.
There's some kind of monster wandering around and it's like <cf>I can't get in!
It's a secret hideout. <cf>I don't want to make too big a deal out of it.
So, we're looking for adventurers to <cf>to help us take down the monsters.
I'd have no problem asking an adventurer to <cf>
Why? <cf>Well, you'll know if you ask me where the safe house is.
...... between you and me, please!
The "Alston Abandoned Mine". <cf>It's in "Castle Shadows Shadows". You know it, right?
At the end of that abandoned mine. <cf>A little lock-up is our hideout.
Oops, I don't want to go any further! <cf>Sorry, but you'll have to guess the rest.
I'm a bit of a wacky guy, and I'm a bit of a lair. <cf>I don't feel like I can ask just anyone to do this job.
So, I've got a job for you! <cf>Go and clear out the "Alston Abandoned Mine" to the back.
Go deep into the "Alston Abandoned Mine" <cf>and wipe out those monsters!
I'm not talking about asking anyone. <cf>You know what I mean?　It's like a big deal.
I'm involved in that, too. <cf>Well, please don't take it any further.
Oh, that was quick! <cf>Okaeri, Otsukare!
No - thank you, thank you, thank you! <cf>Thanks to you, the "Alston Abandoned Mine" is now safe.
Now you can use it as a safe house again.
Our master would say things like ["]you don't have to go that far[,]" or <cf>text me.
Can we leave the monsters alone?　That's what you're saying, isn't it? <cf>What are you really going to do if you get hurt?
I wish you'd think a little <cf>about the people around you who care about that kind of thing!
Well, thanks anyway! <cf>I'll be sure to let our master know exactly what happened.
Well then, I hope you will continue to patronize Coin-tei! <cf>You should visit him at the castle when you're not busy.
But the master is also a bit of a jerk. <cf>I do a lot more work than you think.
Maybe I'll see you and the adventurer again somewhere. <cf>If so, please do me a favor.
That's funny. ....... <cf>I thought I had tucked it away in the back of my bag.
I wonder if I dropped this somewhere: ....... <cf>what should i do?
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>I didn't know what to do. ......
I came to Litze to repair my grandmother's precious jewelry box <cf>
The stones used are rare and <cf>Asterleeds' store can't fix them.
My grandma hasn't been feeling well lately. <cf>I just want to clean out her jewelry box and make her happy.
But I think I dropped the all-important jewelry box somewhere <cf>......
I was startled by a monster near the village and fell down. <cf>I think that's when I dropped it.
Please. <cf>Please find "Grandma's Jewelry Box."
It should be somewhere in " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>
That jewelry box was filled with <cf>memories of my dead grandpa.
If I lost it, <cf>I wouldn't be able to cheer up my grandma ......
I am really sorry, but thank you in advance!
I think "Grandma's Jewel Box" is somewhere at <cf>" <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>
It is very important. <cf>Please find it. Please!
I found <cf>"Grandma's Jewelry Box" that Clarissa said she lost.
It is old, but very carefully cared for. <cf>Looks like it was used with great care for a long time.
I will deliver it to Clarissa in Litze.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Thank goodness you found us.
Definitely "Grandma's Jewel Box". <cf>It was really good ......
I see you found it safe and sound. <cf>First of all, I'm glad to hear it.
While the adventurers were looking for me, I talked to a craftsman at <cf>Litze.
I did so and was introduced to Mr. Gullickson here <cf>
I knew I'd heard the young lady's story. <cf>I decided to take a look at that box once.
...... Oh, I see. <cf>This guy is using some old fashioned stone.
It's a "sunset-colored fluorite. <cf>You won't get this in Asterleeds.
Can you please repair it? <cf>It was my grandmother's prized possession.
We need a new "sunset-colored fluorite. <cf>But the tunnel where this stone was extracted has already collapsed.
Such is the case with ......! <cf>Can't you do something about it?
Yes, you can go to ....... <cf>' <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>' could be a possibility.
Originally, "sunset-colored fluorite" came from <cf>south of Montegnor Valley.
People haven't approached " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>" in a long time. <cf>Maybe it's still lying around.
Really? ......!
However, there are a lot of monsters there. <cf>I guess we'll have to ask the adventurers.
You, can't you lend a hand?
Adventurer, please. <cf>I really want to make my grandmother smile.
Could you please find <cf>"Sunset-colored fluorite" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>"?
Please, please, please, please, please visit ......!
I really wanted to fix my grandma's jewelry box <cf>......
Sorry. <cf>Please, please, please, please!
Adventurer! <cf>Thank you so much!　Truly!
Oh, "sunset-colored fluorite". <cf>The quality and quantity are fine. It's quite an accomplishment, isn't it?
All right, I'll take care of the rest. <cf>I'll take care of the rest.
I can't thank you enough for your adventures. <cf>Thank you, Mr. Gullickson, for your help as well.
You said it was a <cf>memento of your dead grandfather.
It's not my own, but, girl, I've got a good story to tell you. <cf>But I have a good story to tell you.
The Sunset-colored Fluorite was <cf>once popular as a gift for lovers.
I give it to my lover with the setting sun in the background. <cf>The sun may set, but the sunset-colored light will never fade away.
The beautiful memory of this day will continue to shine forever at <cf>with the meaning of ......
I guess this jewelry box was also a gift from an old man to an old woman when he <cf>confessed to her!
I'm sure old <cf>grandma will feel better when she sees the gem restored to the light of olden days!
I can't believe it was that important. ...... <cf>So it's going to be restored. I'm so glad.
I heard some great stories and <cf>I can't thank you enough!
Thank you so much, adventurer!
Grandma and Grandpa's <cf>jewel box of memories. Romantic, isn't it?
I can't wait to show this to my grandma. <cf>I'm sure this will cheer her up.
Woo, not good. <cf>My parents' finances are in trouble: ......
You shouldn't make expensive purchases without thinking. <cf>Craftsman idiots really don't have a good sense of money!
Sorry, I'm talking about our family. <cf>Oh, my gosh, I don't know what to do!
Adventurer~. <cf>I wonder if you can help my family home?
I'm the daughter of a blacksmith heiress. <cf>That's fine, but my family is in big trouble. ......
You bought the new furnace because it looked cool <cf>without thinking twice. Even though it's expensive.
Oh, really, craftsman idiots have a funny sense of money! <cf>Oh, I'm talking about my dad.
Anyway, my wallet is in trouble! <cf>I need to hit the jackpot and turn things around!
The new furnace, you know, it actually performs great. <cf>You'd be surprised how good armor plates can be made.
So I decided to sell this with a bang!
Our goal is to be officially adopted by the Order of Bernhardt! <cf>If your country backs you, the problem is solved!
To that end, I'd like to get a prototype <cf>done right the first time.
In order for it to be used by the Knights of Bernhardt, <cf>it absolutely has to be convertible to a machina.
I just don't know how to make it <cf>without a proper study of the real thing.
So, I need you to pick up some armor for the machina.
Someone saw a fight between a <cf>bandit and a machina on " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>" before.
It was a while ago, so there must still be something down there. <cf>I'd like a copy of "The Cracked Armor Plate of Machina"!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>" and look for <cf>"Cracked Machina Armor Plates"
We're going to make a good prototype and <cf>get it officially adopted by the Knights of Bernhardt!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Did you find the "Cracked Machina Armor Plate"?
Hoho, so that's what this is! <cf>A valuable decision-making tool!　I'll take a look right away.
Hmmm...hmmm......... hohoho! <cf>This is another mysterious processing technique: ......
Hmmm, amazing!　Flexibility and strength at the same time! <cf>That's what a military nation is all about!
It looks like you have a <cf>strong competitor on the road to official adoption. ......
...... but the construction of this part. <cf>I guess it's sacrificed for joint operation.
If we can improve this area, maybe ....... <cf>If we could use that ore and work on the ratio of the mixture, ......
Our furnace can do it. ...... <cf>Yeah, I think I might be seeing the light!
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I need you to find something for me at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>'.
The "Solitary Black Ray Ore". <cf>It's an ore we don't normally use and it's not in circulation.
But our furnace would work well. <cf>Please help us avoid a life of debt!
Try mining for ore at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>". <cf>What I want is "Solitary Black Ray Ore".
We should be able to make a prototype with that thing. <cf>To avoid our debt, please!
It's "Solitary Black Ray Ore", thank you! <cf>Now I can make a prototype armored plate.
Calculations show that both flexibility and strength can be maintained. <cf>And yet it should be possible to process without inhibiting movement!
A new furnace would accomplish plenty! <cf>Dad's waste of money does come in handy once in a while.
I'll make a prototype with it and try to sell it. <cf>Maybe we can do something about our family financial crisis!
Thanks to the adventurers, we can move forward! <cf>Thank you so much!
I've tried to make a pitch to the Knights of Bernhardt. <cf>But they are slow to reply!
What if Dad buys something weird again? <cf>Come on, come on!　Hurry up and officially adopt~!
In Bernhardt, they gave out knighthoods to people who had made a difference <cf>outside of battle, you know.
So you are allowed to go in and out of the castle. <cf>It's a very interesting thing, isn't it?
Ya-ya, that's helpful. Adventurer. <cf>I was having trouble finding someone to ask at the castle, too.
My name is Rius, a farm knight. <cf>Please make my acquaintance.
It's an ostentatious title, though. <cf>In short, it's the farmer who produces the most crops in the country.
I heard that the old kings thought that the common people should be honored for their achievements. <cf>Well, thank goodness for that!
I'm at least trying to live up to the title. <cf>I'm trying to be helpful in my own way, yes.
And then I heard that farmers were in trouble. <cf>So I flew over here.
I heard that the yield has dropped a lot. <cf>I found out the cause: monsters and soil.
I need materials to counter each of them. <cf>I would like to ask the adventurers to help me.
First of all, please go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>" and look for <cf>"Fibers of Glowing Grass".
I often use it to keep birds away because of the glitter, but <cf>it works on wild animals too!
This will get rid of little goats and the like. <cf>For now, let's deal with that first.
Can you collect <cf>"Fibers of Glowing Grass" at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>"?
We have some soil problems. <cf>First, we need to keep the monsters away from the fields!
I guess I will make one more request later. <cf>First, I would like to ask for "Fibers of Glowing Grass".
Oh, adventurer. Thank you very much. <cf>It's "Fibers of Glowing Grass."
Well, glitter is a good thing. <cf>This glitter, it works.
We'll get rid of monsters and animals. <cf>They won't be able to eat your crops anymore.
And here is the other problem. <cf>The soil in the field is getting tired.
I thought it would be good to nourish and revitalize them.
This time, please use " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". <cf>Please go and pick "Namiuchi Lily Flowers".
It takes a bit of work to remove the salt and dry it, but <cf>it makes a good old-fashioned fertilizer!
It's an old omen. <cf>There's a spell to bury them in the fields.
I bow down to our predecessors. <cf>Customs have meaning.
Other fertilizers are too strong for our tired land. <cf>I would like to have "Namiuchi Lily Blossom" please.
You can find the "Namiuchi Lily Flower" at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>
It used to be used a lot, but <cf>I don't see it much anymore.
This is the best way to improve the soil. <cf>I'd like a copy of "The Flower of the Namiuchi Lily," please.
Wow, that is a magnificent Namiuchi Lily flower! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
Monsters and soil. <cf>I think we can solve both problems with this one.
Farmers in this region are having a hard time. <cf>This climate, right?　Cold and dry.
So much of the land has been rendered useless by the war.
Nowadays, I am called a farm knight. <cf>I have been through many hardships.
We owe a lot to everyone. <cf>Therefore, I will use this material for everyone.
As a knight of agriculture, I hope I can help others.
Thanks to the adventurers. <cf>On behalf of the farmers of Bernhardt, I thank you.
Please come to Bernhardt anytime. <cf>You're always welcome here.
I'm not used to being called a knight of agriculture, but <cf>I'd feel better if I were.
We must do our best to support all the farmers. <cf>If we don't get our shit together, they'll laugh at us.
When you're a peddler, <cf>you're bound to get a lot of offers.
We are often asked to introduce people. <cf>We have a wide range of faces, which is one of our selling points.
I've been asked to introduce you to someone. <cf>How about you?
From the looks of it, you seem to be skilled and <cf>well-spoken. He fits the bill perfectly.
I often go to the Principality of Bernhardt for business. <cf>I was asked to do this for you there.
There's a monster I'd like you to take down. <cf>He said he's been out in a bit of a tricky spot.
So, you were looking for a skilled and well-spoken adventurer <cf>
For more information, ask a soldier named Tsezal at Bernhardt Castle <cf>
If you tell them you introduced me to Adah, they'll understand. <cf>Sorry for the hassle. I'm glad you asked!
I need you to take them down in Bernhardt. <cf>It's a request for a monster.
For more information, ask a soldier named Tsezal at Bernhardt Castle <cf>
I hear it's going to be a tricky place to get out. <cf>You've got to remember to be ready.
Are you the adventurer Mr. Adah introduced me to? <cf>Thank you. I've been waiting for you.
There are many different types of adventurers, so I'm asking <cf>for a smart ada to introduce me to them.
I'm sure you'll be fine. <cf>Let me get right to it and talk about your request.
I want you to defeat the monsters at <cf>and <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_19_00_02001"/>and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_20_00_02001"/>. Please take them both down.
' <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>' is <cf>in a place where it's hard to make a very public request.
You have to be a tight-lipped adventurer to ...... what? <cf>You've been in an underground canal before?
Well, you are the ...... of the Dunkirk case. <cf>That would be a safe request then.
That place is also used as an escape route in case of emergency. <cf>The fewer people know it exists, the better.
And, of course, there should be no monsters.
I can't believe that even by chance, Mr. Adah caught your eye. <cf>No, maybe it was inevitable.
Once again, I request <cf>of " <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>" to take down the monster.
I know you are a dangerous partner, but please take care of me!
<cf>of " <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>" I'd like to ask you to take down a monster.
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_19_00_02001"/>and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_20_00_02001"/>. Both please.
It's not a very public place. <cf>I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your request to yourself as well.
Hey, it's you. I see you were able to take down the <cf>monster from " <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>".
That's what I thought. Just as I suspected.
The proto-machina Dogolman was a troublesome opponent, wasn't he? <cf>Well done.
Some of the machinas are being discarded as <cf>failures.
They start working without your knowledge and <cf>sometimes problems like this happen.
I'd better figure out how to dispose of it a bit: ......
Now you want me to go find someone at <cf>who can dispose of Makina safely?
Oh, man, you're a real people person.
Haha, sorry. <cf>But thanks again to Mr. Adah for helping me out this time.
Because it's best to leave the brokering of difficult requests like this to <cf>Ada.
You are a good flirt. <cf>Well, I guess it's thanks to you that I can say this.
Thank you very much. <cf>You did exactly what I asked you to do.
I've got a reliable adventurer and a good friend. <cf>If I ever need anything else, I'll ask for your help.
In a country as big as Bernhardt, <cf>there are many jobs to choose from.
Well, I'm not trying to be a bad person. <cf>You should help all kinds of people.
Because your connections with others may unexpectedly help you <cf>
I think there's still a lot of <cf>room for development in Kanaloa.
Close to Bernhardt Castle, <cf>Asterleeds liner passes right by.
If you get it off the ground right, <cf>you're going to have a big business!
Hey there!　Have you come to <cf>in pursuit of new possibilities too?
I'm thinking of going into business. <cf>I want to make Kanaloa more exciting!
This is close to Bernhardt Castle and <cf>Asterleeds' regular boats also pass offshore.
It's a place full of potential for more big <cf>developments!
I want to start a business or industry in Kanaloa other than seafood <cf>
And eventually, I'll make Kanaloa a big city, and <cf>I'll make my name in history as a great merchant!
This request is the first step toward the future. <cf>We will be compensated for it. It's a cost that must be paid now.
First of all, I'm thinking of creating a local specialty alongside seafood. <cf>I have a flower that blooms only at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>".
The seeds of these flowers are full of nutrients and <cf>could be used in a variety of processed products!
However, monsters come to eat these too, so <cf>it's hard to collect them safely.
We need a drastic solution. <cf>That's where you come in!
First, let's gather clues and find out what kind of monsters show up at <cf>
Could you please go to <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>and collect the "Seeds with teeth marks" from <cf>?
It's a pretty big seed. <cf>I think there's some leftover food down there.
Once you see the real thing, you'll know what you're dealing with. <cf>After that, I'm going to ask you to take them down, so please do!
From its dentition, I'd like you to take it down <cf>because I think you'll be able to figure out what the monster is.
We've got rewards for you, including defeat. <cf>Please be enthusiastic and fulfill the request!
Good work! <cf>I see you were able to collect the 'toothed seeds'.
Okay, I've got a perfect dentition. <cf>Well, according to the illustrated book I bought at the pioneer bureau: ......
I see!　That's the dentition of <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>!
What is ......? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>is a mutant of the Kaiser Elk, which is quite ferocious.
They are basically herbivores, but they are temperamental and <cf>can attack humans and animals, he said.
I'm glad I included the request to take down the monster. <cf>I couldn't have dealt with this monster on my own.
Once again, could you please take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>at ' <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>'?
I need you <cf>to help me advance my business!
I need you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>of " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>". <cf>They seem to be pretty strong, so be careful!
I need you <cf>to help me advance my business!　Please do it!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>You took down the "Mere Old Man"! <cf>Thank you!
Now I can collect at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>" with confidence. <cf>My business has finally started!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>is a tough and <cf>rare monster, I hear.
That's what it says in the illustrated book. <cf>It said it would be difficult to defeat them unless you were a skilled adventurer.
That means you're good at it, too! <cf>I'm lucky to know a good adventurer!
...... hmm?　If you mean rare monsters, <cf>maybe <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>meat or something more commercial?
No, that's not an ongoing business. <cf>I'm not looking to make one-time money.
I'm trying to get new commerce and industry to take root in Kanaloa, <cf>because I want it to grow into a bigger city!
Thanks a lot! <cf>Come see me next time you're in business and see how big I've become!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>We've started working on a new product right away!
I see <cf>is close to becoming Kanaloa's new specialty!
I'm sure this port will get a big makeover! <cf>I think there will even be a pier named after me!
Because of the Dunkirk former commander's case, <cf>we are in need of some manpower.
I've got a lot of work piling up on my plate, too. ...... <cf>Oh, no. I'll have to work overtime again. ......
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your time.
Sorry, please wait a moment. <cf>I'll get the paperwork out of the way soon. ......
[I'm sorry to keep you waiting. <cf>I've been a little busy with work.
Since the incident with the former Commander of Dunkirk, <cf>the entire Principality of Bernhardt is seriously understaffed!
I have been sent out to fight monsters myself. <cf>Lately, I've been getting a lot of damage from <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>
From planning extermination to deployment, <cf>we have to put it all together and clean it up.
Once this is over, I'll be able to settle down and finally take a vacation at <cf>
Now I forgot to get my leave authorization letter from my superior <cf>......
That's how I blew my last vacation.
Adventurer. I'm sorry, but could you please go to <cf>and pick up the permit instead?
My supervisor is out of town right now supervising training. <cf>I couldn't find the time to go there myself. ......
You can find <cf>in the camp of " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>".
I've already applied for a leave of absence. <cf>I'm sure Set will get the message if I tell him you asked me to do it.
Best regards. <cf>Now, in the meantime, I need to arrange for crab spider repellent supplies: ......
Instructor Lambert should be supervising the training of <cf>recruits at the camp of " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>"
I'll understand if you tell me Set's request. <cf>Go pick up your vacation authorization form.
I have to <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>proceed with <cf>measures in the meantime, so ......
Hey, you! <cf>Don't take me seriously, you chickenshits!
[--] Mm?　This is Mister Adventurer. <cf>Sorry for shouting so loud.
The new recruits are slackening off! <cf>Will the adventurers get into the swing of things, too?
Hmm, what?　Accepted a request from Set?
You forgot to pick up your ...... vacation permit? <cf>You're slack!　I'll have to go back to work!
My God, I'm kidding. <cf>I know how Set works.
Of course I'll grant you a leave of absence. <cf>Here's the permit. Deliver it to Set.
There is one condition, however.
This permit is only valid with "Nourishing Nuts" and the <cf>set.
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>I'm sure Set will have no time to go and get them. <cf>Set's guy probably doesn't have time to go get them.
Sorry, can't the adventurers collect them and deliver them together to <cf>?
Eat something nourishing and let your body rest. <cf>We would be grateful if you could tell us so.
I'll train the chicks. <cf>That'll take some of the burden off my men.
So, I'm asking for "Nourishing Nuts". <cf>You can find them at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>.
[--]Mm. Hey, you, what are you slacking off for? <cf>Go back to your posts!　Then swing a thousand times!
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>" and pick up <cf>"Nourishing Nuts".
I want you to deliver that to Seto along with the permit. <cf>Well, what the hell!　A boring parting gift from a superior officer.
Sorry for the trouble, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I look forward to working with you.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer!　Oh, my God!
What, a vacation permit? <cf>I appreciate it, but that's not the point!
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>has appeared and is closing in on <cf>neighboring settlements!
We cannot afford to gather people now. <cf>Can you help us?
It's a bit much, but take them down 15 at a time. <cf>If we kill that many, the herd should pull back.
Damage must be minimized. <cf>Located at " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". Let's hurry!
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>is approaching the village! <cf>Let's head out to defeat it immediately!
If we take them down 15 at a time, the herd should disperse.
Located at: " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". <cf>Please hurry!
Good job, adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>has run away, hasn't he?
We also repaired the fence. <cf>This should be good for the time being.
It's thanks to the adventurers. <cf>If a settlement is razed, there is nothing we can do about it.
Thank you for your cooperation in defeating this problem!
Ah, yes. <cf>You asked for a vacation permit.
Yes, I certainly received it. <cf>Huh?　Is this "Nourishing Nuts"?
Valid as a set with a permit, Instructor Lambert? <cf>...... Oh, I see. So the instructor sent you this.
I only applied last time and didn't take a break, so <cf>I'm sure they cared.
I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help. <cf>Thanks to the adventurers, I will be able to rest properly this time!
Thank you for your help. <cf>Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you!
Now that I'm finally done, <cf>I'm going to take a good rest!
After that, it looks like I'll be back to work. ...... <cf>My superiors seem to care about me, and I'll do my best.
Bapharia's heritage is <cf>sometimes found in the most unexpected places.
You dig up a field and it comes out, or you <cf>get caught on a hook in the river.
Non-adventurers can find them, you know. <cf>It's dangerous, though, so only technicians should touch it.
I'm a technician whose job is to <cf>repair and maintain Bapharia's heritage.
There's an antique dealer in Kanaloa named Narai. <cf>I've known him for a long time.
He's a discerning guy, <cf>and often finds Bapharia's legacy too.
but it's not that guy's business. <cf>He sends them to me.
Thanks for the help, <cf>I haven't heard from Narai in a while.
If it's just that I can't find the legacy, <cf>that's fine, but I'm a little worried.
I just wish there was some kind of <cf>accident related to Bapharia's heritage.
Sorry, but could you go check on him?
I'm Narai, an antique dealer in Kanaloa. <cf>If he's in trouble, give him a hand.
Go check out Kanaloa's antique store at <cf>Narai.
He's a guy I've been taking care of for a while. <cf>If he's in need of any help, I'd like you to lend him a hand.
I'm Narai, the antique dealer. What can I do for you?
Did Johnson ask you to come check on him? <cf>Oh, yeah. Because I haven't heard from you lately.
Sorry about that. <cf>I couldn't find the legacy of Bapharia.
I don't have anything I can send him, so I just <cf>lost contact with him. Sorry about that.
Actually, the other day. <cf>I was on the road and came across <value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/>.
They bit off my bag and <cf>swallowed the bunch of keys with it.
In it, along with the key to the <cf>warehouse where they kept Bapharia's legacy.
I couldn't even get into the house. ...... <cf>I had to break a window. Oh dear.
That's why I couldn't contact Johnson at <cf>
Fortunately, I didn't get hurt. <cf>But we can't leave the warehouse like this.
Anta, I'm sorry, but would you do me a favor?
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/>From <cf>I need to get back "The Antique Dealer's Bundle of Keys".
There are five keys in total. <cf>Can you collect them all? Sorry, please.
Go to " <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>" and take down five <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/>.
They must have swallowed "The Antique Dealer's Bundle of Keys". <cf>Five in all. Can you get them back for me?
Oh, you! <cf>I see you've retrieved the "Antique Dealer's Bundle of Keys" for me.
Yeah, I have all 5 of them. <cf>That was really helpful!　Thank you.
Hold on a second. <cf>I'm gonna go pack up the warehouse.
Sorry, I made you wait. <cf>You're going back to Asterleeds, aren't you?
Then take this.
I've put together a <cf>summary of Bapharia's legacy from the warehouse.
I want you to give it to Johnson. <cf>I want you to give it to Johnson as an apology for worrying him.
Tell him I'll send him <cf>if I find another legacy.
Thanks for the bunch of keys. <cf>Have a safe trip back to Asterleeds.
It would be helpful if you could give the package to Johnson.
I put together a list of Bapharia's heritage. <cf>Also tell them I'll send them to you if I find any more.
Hey adventurer, you're back from Kanaloa. <cf>How was Narai?
...... Well, I just lost the key to the warehouse. <cf>Glad nothing happened to you, man.
Thank you for taking down the monster. <cf>I thank you too.
Hmm?　You have a package for me from Narai?
Oh!　That's Bapharia's legacy! <cf>I'm grateful for this. I'll take it.
Bapharia's heritage is lying all over the place outside of the <cf>ruins.
Someone like Narai, who can find <cf>on a moment's notice, is a rare find.
There are some digs that are different from the ones at the site and some <cf>rare features that are still there.
Heritage research and technological development can come from places like <cf>
Of course, adventurers also contribute greatly. <cf>This time, too, it was thanks to you.
Thank you very much! <cf>I'll never forget what you did for me and Narai.
That Narai guy is funny as ever <cf>I'm off to find out more about Bapharia's heritage.
The Bapharia cult seems to be interested. <cf>Maybe we can connect them face to face once.
He's got a lot of antiques for sale, too. <cf>I'm sure the cult will buy a lot of stuff from him.
I'm not very good at talking to people. ......
Can someone please speak on my behalf: ......
Wow, wow, uh, let's see: ......
Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. <cf>I'll let this girl talk to you. ......
'[--]Oh, my gosh!　I'm Nina, the stuffed animal! <cf>My name is Rebecca. Nice to meet you."
Rebecca is shy, so <cf>Nina does the talking for her."
'I learned how to do it from a traveling puppeteer. <cf>Mr. Paolo, was it ......?"
'Anyway, can you tell me about Rebecca and Nina's story at <cf>?'
'Rebecca, I want to go to <cf>to thank you for all you've done for me.
But in front of him, I get so nervous <cf>and embarrassed that I can't speak well."
'So, I want you to have your adventurers follow me <cf>and thank me together!'
Rebecca will be able to do well with the adventurers at <cf>."
'I have three people I want to thank. <cf>They all live in Asterleeds.'
'Go to those people and <cf>give them a bowing gesture!"
'First of all, Largo the bookseller. <cf>He presents Rebecca with a lovely picture book."
If you see Mr. Largo, please give him a bow at <cf>."
'Well, I'm counting on you! <cf>'Here you go, Rebecca!　First we have to thank the adventurers!"
Oh, thanks ......! <cf>That ...... Oh, please, please ......!
'Find Mr. Largo in Asterleeds and give him the <cf>bowing gesture!'
'This is the bookstore where Rebecca has been helping me. <cf>I just wanted to thank you all for your help.'
We are a bookstore. <cf>What can we do for you, adventurer?
I'm still busy. <cf>If it's not an order, you can do it later.
Well, Rebecca's. <cf>Let's see what kind of picture book she'll enjoy next: ......
...... what? <cf>Largo, the bookstore, is definitely me.
Have you ever been to my store? <cf>I don't remember any adventurers thanking me.
Oh, wow ...... that ......
Hmm?　...... Rebecca? <cf>I sent you a picture book addressed to your mother.
So, that ...... picture book, always ......
Oh, ugh ....... <cf>Bo, Mr. Adventurer ......
If you have something to say, <cf>make sure you say it from your own mouth. Rebecca.
This adventurer told me. <cf>But I heard nothing from you.
I'm glad you came all the way to ....... <cf>But that's not your only errand.
Come back when you can do it yourself.
'...... Largo, I think he was angry. <cf>Nina was a little taken aback too.'
'But she told me to come back. <cf>Rebecca said she would try again!
'In the meantime, he'd like to thank the others and <cf>practice.'
'Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you help me find Mr. Herritt, the delivery man, next?"
'Largo's picture books are brought to you by <cf>because of Ms. Herritt.'
'Go to Mr. Herritt, <cf>and bow to him like you did earlier.'
'Can you help me find Mr. Herritt, the delivery man, next? <cf>He's somewhere in Asterleeds.'
Ah~. <cf>It's another beautiful day~!
Hey there, sometime adventurer. <cf>Thanks for taking over the delivery for me back then.
Words of thanks are nice, aren't they? <cf>It makes both the person saying it and the person being thanked feel good.
Hey, what's going on? <cf>Did I do something for you?
Huh?　It's Rebecca, isn't it? <cf>You're with the adventurers today, aren't you?
Oh, that ......, right? <cf>Yes, I always deliver picture books ...... Thank you ......
Oh, I wanted to thank you ...... <cf>adventurer for following me ......
I can't talk properly when I'm alone ...... <cf>, so ......
That's right~. You're welcome.
I'm so proud of you for being able to say thank you! <cf>If it were me, I'd probably just take a nap and forget about it!
And don't think it's important to try to do what you can't do yourself <cf>with someone else~!
When I'm not feeling motivated either, I ask <cf>Adventurers to deliver for me~!
'From Nina's point of view, <cf>that makes me wonder if it's okay.'
But I don't care!　Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I could thank Mr. Herritt!'
'There's one more person Rebecca would like to thank <cf>......'
Largo sends along a picture book with <cf>a cute little letter!"
'He said he really wants to thank <cf>the person who writes that letter!'
'Mr. Largo doesn't seem to be writing <cf>, but ......'
Then I'm sure it's Lindsay the Substitute Writer~!
Largo's handwriting is powerful~. <cf>I could never write a cute letter~!
Lindsay is a girl, and <cf>don't think she's a letter that Rebecca would be happy with~!
'Yes, that's right. <cf>Thanks for telling me, Mr. Herritt!"
'Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you take me to Mr. Lindsay's?"
'If you see Lindsay, <cf>give her another bow!
Oh, please ......!　Mr. Adventurer!
Can you help me find Lindsey, the substitute writer?"
'If you see Lindsay, <cf>give her another bowing gesture!
Substitute handwriting, substitute handwriting~♪ <cf>I'll put my heart and soul into my handwritten paper today, too!
Ha-ha-ha!　I've been asked. <cf>Lindsay the Substitute Writer's store is here.
I don't have anything to ask of the adventurers today. <cf>What can I do for you?
Huh? <cf>Did I do something to be thanked by the adventurers?
What I've requested from you is <cf>whatever may have happened ......
Uh, let's see, ......! <cf>Ms. Lindsay. Thanks for the lovely letter.
I'm Rebecca ....... <cf>Largo sent me a picture book, ......
I always look forward to your letters. They are so cute. <cf>So, I wanted to thank you ......
Wow, so you came all the way out here? <cf>Thank you!　I'm very happy!
Ehehe ......
'I'm glad you're pleased! <cf>Now all we need is Mr. Largo, but what to do: ......'
'I still want to thank you properly, but ......
Largo is so eccentric! <cf>That face and voice, kinda scary, right?
But every time I send him a picture book, he asks me to write on his behalf. <cf>He's a bean, and he's a good person at heart.
Oh, yeah!　Hey, Rebecca. <cf>If it's too hard to tell me in person, how about a letter?
I will teach you how to write. <cf>Then you can convey your thoughts even if you can't speak, right?
Oh ......!　I want to write a letter to Mr. Largo, I want to write a letter to Mr. Largo! <cf>I want to write a letter to Mr. Largo, I want to write a letter to Mr. Largo!
All right, I'll take care of it! <cf>Well then, let's get started!
I'll bring you a nice set of letters, too, <cf>!
So, I was able to do this: ....... To Mr. Largo, letter!
Yes, yes, I think it's a beautiful letter! <cf>I'm sure Largo will be very happy to receive it!
'Adventurer, will you follow me again to Largo's <cf>?'
'I want the adventurers to come with me. <cf>You don't have to bow this time!'
'Once again, <cf>come with me to Mr. Largo's.'
'Just talk to me normally this time. <cf>Please, adventurer!"
It's you again. <cf>Rebecca's with you. What do you want?
Oh, that ...... this ......!
Hmm?　Is this a ...... letter? <cf>Did ...... Rebecca write it?
Ah, u...... er, ...... yes, that's right!
La, to Largo, thank you ...... that ......
...... You write very well. <cf>Your handwriting is much better than mine.
["]Thanks for all your picture books ["]. <cf>Thank you, too, for reading them.
I'll send you another interesting book to look forward to, <cf>. Rebecca.
...... yeah!　Thanks, Largo.
Oh, uh, you know, ....... <cf>I've also got a letter for you, adventurer: ...... ......
'Rebecca, you know, I wrote to the adventurers at <cf>to thank you, too!
I was so happy that she thanked me with her! <cf>I'm so glad you said thank you with me!"
Ehehe ....... <cf>Thanks for the adventure, too.
Next time, I'll do my best to thank you myself.
Oh, you're an adventurer. ....... <cf>Good luck with your work and all.
Nina also says ["]good luck ["]......
Ehehe ....... <cf>It's a little embarrassing, but I could say it: ......
There are also junior civil servants like us running around <cf>cleaning up after a series of incidents, etc.
The top is rushing me, and the military is complaining about me. ...... <cf>Ugh, my stomach hurts. ......
Adventurers. <cf>Would you like to help us?
We are currently investigating <cf>the old underground canals that exist in Bernhardt Castle
The facility has already been decommissioned, but <cf>it will be considered for reuse as well.
We're going to <cf>do a site survey to see if there are any dilapidations or other hazards.
Well, it's pretty old, so it's unlikely to be <cf>actually reused ......
Even if it seems meaningless at first glance, keep track of the state of affairs. <cf>That is also the job of a civilian official. Hi.
Actually, I just had Bernhardt's army send <cf>soldiers to help me.
I got hit by a monster that was lurking in the underground canal and <cf>ran away and came back!
Well, I'm here. ...... <cf>The higher ups are rushing me to get it done as soon as possible.
And the military will <cf>shove me up your ass for injuring a soldier.
We need to keep our heads down on both sides and get on with the job. <cf>Ugh, it's itty bitty ....... My stomach hurts: ......
So, we have concluded that it is best to ask a trusted adventurer <cf>
Can you please conduct the "Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway, Additional Survey" at <cf>?
Please report back to me when you are done. <cf>I am here to take care of another matter.
Ugh, it's going to take a lot of work over here too. <cf>My stomach is in knots: ......
Can you please conduct the "Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway, Additional Survey" at <cf>
Please report to me when you are finished. <cf>I hope the adventurers will not be injured.
Thank you for your work on "Bernhardt Castle Underground Waterway, Additional Survey", <cf>
Now we can finally put together our report. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation.
Now my stomach can rest ....... <cf>I wish I could have done it. Ouch.
Now we are arguing about whether we should exterminate the monster in the canal or <cf>leave it alone. ......
It would be expensive to get rid of them, but <cf>we can't just leave them alone.
So both are problematic. Hi.
Well, it's our job at <cf>to do something about it.
I'll give up and move on to the next document. <cf>Thank you for this time.
If I need anything else, I'll be happy to <cf>request it. Hi.
This is how we are looking around in Kanaloa and other settlements <cf>
You never know where the problem may lie. <cf>It's part of my job to make steady visits to the outside world, hi.
I hear there has been a tragic event at the "Drava Royal Research Institute" <cf>
I didn't ask for all the details. ......
At the very least, I would like to offer a prayer. <cf>May the sinful souls find forgiveness and peace.
Thank you for Accepting our request on such short notice <cf> Dear Adventurer
You may have heard about the "Drava Royal Research Institute" at <cf>, Adventurer.
Thanks to Mr. Carvein, <cf>the worst was averted!
However, it is true that a tragic event has occurred. <cf>The institute has been closed and an investigation is underway.
However, the progress of this investigation <cf>seems to be less than encouraging.
I have asked the Knights several times and have not received a <cf>constructive response!
That is why we have asked our adventurers to conduct a survey at <cf>
I'd like to refrain from doing anything that violates the Knights' domain, but <cf>we can't afford to delay too long!
Let's go to the institute first. <cf>I will explain the situation to the Knights.
The "Drava Royal Research Institute" is being investigated by the Order of Bernhardt at <cf>
I really should leave it to you, but <cf>seems to be making slow progress.
I will explain to the Knights how we asked the adventurers to investigate <cf>
First of all, please come with us to the "Drava Royal Research Institute" at <cf>
Captain!　This is impossible! <cf>He said it's too hard!
Don't sound so pathetic, Scherni! <cf>Yet you are a member of the glorious Order of Bernhardt!
Thank you for your service. <cf>Mr. Vilmer, Mr. Scherni.
Huh?　It's Anelma, hello! <cf>And you're an adventurer with us?
Mwah!　What do you want, Anelma? <cf>Have you come to check on the progress of our investigation again?
...... I'm telling you, there's no glaring results.
That's right. This place is so convoluted on the inside, and <cf>there are a lot of monsters roaming around.
Right now, only newbies like me can move, so I go to <cf>to investigate, fail, and repeat!
Don't blabber on about your inner workings, you idiot!
We've asked this adventurer to investigate the "Drava Royal Research Institute" at <cf>
I'm sure both Vilmer and Scherni are tired. <cf>Please have a good night's rest.
Hey, wait a minute! <cf>The investigation of the institute is under the jurisdiction of the Knights!
I am aware of this, but since there has been no progress on <cf>for any length of time
I have made a request of you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I am willing to enter the laboratory if necessary.
You!　Of course not! <cf>You can't let outsiders in so easily!
Well, well, well, Captain!　Anelma, too! <cf>Let's stop fighting as soon as we see each other!
It's because this guy says all the things he wants to say!
I am simply stating the facts. <cf>If it is too much for the Order to handle, there must be another way.
What...what...oh~?
<span size="Big">Adventurers, please! &lt;/&gt;
Drava Royal Research Institute, Additional Research," right? <cf>Just go and finish it quickly!
Hey, Scherni! <cf>What are you talking about?
No, it has to be this way or the captain and <cf>Anelma won't be able to fit it in~!
Mr. Villmer. <cf>My story is not finished.
I can't say it enough!　I can't say it enough!
Come on, adventurer, now's the time!　Now while! <cf>I'll take care of these two.
'Drava Royal Research Institute, Additional Research', please!
Drava Royal Research Institute, Additional Research. <cf>Just get it done already!
I will take care of the Captain and Mr. Anelma. <cf>We always do.
Let Anelma do what she wants! <cf>Scherni!　I knew it, you go investigate!
Is it the behavior of a <cf>knight to force his subordinates to do such a thing?
See, already~. Even when the adventurers come back <cf>they are definitely still fighting, these two~!
Oh, it's Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Have you finished your investigation of the "Drava Royal Research Institute"?
Glad to hear you are safe, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation.
Muuu...... I'd have to say you've done an excellent job. <cf>Sorry you had to go through all that trouble on our behalf, Mr. Adventurer.
The Knights would like to thank you for your help. <cf>As it turns out, this was an investigation by an outsider, but that's the way it has to be.
I, as an outsider, was not allowed to enter the institute <cf>.
No wonder!　I can't let a woman like you <cf>into a place like that, where things are so dangerous!
You and Mister Adventurer, who knows how to fight, <cf>are not talking about the same thing!　Think a little!
...... left you?
Excuse me, Mr. Captain. I'm a woman too.
You're a soldier!　 <span size="Big">Work! &lt;/&gt;
Ehhhh, unreasonable~!
Anyway!　I thank you for your cooperation this time, Mr. Adventurer, but <cf>I will not tolerate this kind of imitations from now on!
Know your place! <cf>Do you understand, Anelma?
Oh, my God~ you always get into fights at <cf>because you say things like that!
--Yes, sir.
You're always, always, always complaining about me and the activities of the <cf>Knights of Columbus--hmm?
It is true that I went too far this time. <cf>I apologize for the concern and inconvenience to Mr. Vilmer.
I also apologize for any words or actions that may have been used to undermine the Order. <cf>My apologies.
Oh, oh ......
Thank you very much, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I will leave you now. Good bye.
...... Did I offend you in any way?　Captain.
I've never seen Anelma back down like that before <cf>?
No, there's no such thing as ....... <cf>No, there isn't, is there?　Tell me there isn't, cherni.
I wonder if it's not ......? <cf>Hmm?　But I'm more ...... than angry.
It also seemed like he was a little happy. <cf>What is it?　...... something~something~suspicious~♪
Captain Vilmer and Anelma, <cf>always in that tone, they have the worst chemistry~!
No, you're rather close? <cf>They say, "The more they fight, the better.
Are those two, perhaps, ......? <cf>Eh, if so, that would be super interesting!
I think I'll explore this one...grin.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>You were a big help to us one day when we needed a new kiln.
I've tried my hand at making smoked fish since then. <cf>The kiln only explodes once in a while now.
Oh well, I guess that's the extent of the charm... ♪
Alright, now that I'm getting more comfortable with the kiln. <cf>I guess I want to take my smoking to the next level.
I think next time I want to stick to the <cf>chip that's the source of the Chemistry.
Do you know what a "glowing piece of wood" is? <cf>It's a plant found in the back of Dragon Claw Valley.
I hear it smells really good when you burn it.
But, as I said, they don't sell them. <cf>I can only get it by requesting it from an adventurer.
'Fierce battle!　Dragon Claw Valley" to the depths and get the <cf>"Glowing Piece of Wood"?
'Fierce battle!　Dragon Claw Valley", you can get a <cf>"Glowing Piece of Wood".
It smells so good when you burn it. <cf>It's great for making smoked food.
I'll share with you when I've made a delicious smoked fish. <cf>I wish you the best of luck~!
Oh, thank you very much. <cf>It is indeed a "glowing piece of wood"!
Hot Chichi Chichi ....... <cf>It's already hot just to have it.
Kunkun ....... I see. <cf>It smells like a deep forest too.
Well then, get to it and set it in the smoking kiln: ......
...... Ohhh! It's so smoky! <cf>This thing can smoke well.
It's going to make a good smoked fish. ...... Geehaw. <cf>Hmm?　Very chemically ...... gho, gho...
Wait, I think I'm coming out a bit too much, don't you? <cf>Aww, stop stoppin ...... geehogeehogeehogeehogeehogeehogeehogeehogeehogeehog!
Wow! <cf>I'm so excited!
Hey, you there! <cf>What are you doing in the city!
[--]I see. <cf>I was making smoked fish with "Glowing Pieces of Wood," and...
How much smoke is too much? <cf>There was even a call that there was a fire!
And then there are the complaints! <cf>The laundry smelled unappealing.
I hear it adds a smoky flavor to the meal! <cf>...... really a complaint?　This is.
Anyway, the material from "Dragon Claw Valley" <cf>should not be used lightly!　It's dangerous!
I'm so sorry. <cf>I'll share the smoked fish with the pioneer bureau to make up for it.
Ugh, it's so delicious ....... <cf>No, be careful anyway!
The "Glowing Piece of Wood" or ....... <cf>Would anyone be willing to Accept a collection request?
Hmmm. It is indeed a precious material. <cf>I didn't expect it to burn that badly.
The smoked fish is very good! <cf>But it's hard to make a lot of it!
I'll have to check again to see if there are any other good chips. <cf>Smoking is all about passion and trial and error!
I also need to make sure I don't piss off the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>Thanks a lot. I hope you'll Accept my request again.
Hmmm... <cf>I've been getting smoked orders from the Pioneer Station lately!
They give me "glowing pieces of wood" every once in a while. <cf>I don't know what it is, but it seems to work.
I want to make another new smoked fish!
I wonder if many of the merchants in Asterleeds are <cf>abit of a jerk?
["]Come on, come on! ["] <cf>, I'm always in a hurry.
It would be better to live in the rhythm of nature, <cf>breathing in the wind and waves!
Welcome to Jubilia, adventurer. <cf>I assume you're on vacation or something?　I hope you're all right.
When you take a break, don't overdo it. <cf>Let nature take its course and live life as it is!
My name is Nenemarina. <cf>I make soap for a living.
A merchant in Asterleeds likes it so much that he goes all the way to <cf>Jubilia to buy it!
Oh, it looks like that merchant just arrived.
Ms. Nenemarina!　How are you doing? <cf>Did you make the soap?
I gave it to you the other day. <cf>Was that not enough?
No, no, not even close!
That soap is very popular at Asterleeds. <cf>It sold from the first place we stocked it.
So we need to stock up on more! <cf>Make some nenemalina, too!　Come on, come on!
Asterleeds people are impatient.
I used to make one every two days. <cf>You said you were in a hurry, so you're making one every day.
I want about twenty of them every day!
It's not good to be so busy. <cf>It's best to keep the wind and waves calm.
So is our life. <cf>We live to the rhythm of nature.
And even if I wanted to make soap in the first place, I can't because I've run out of <cf>materials.
Eh!　Is that so!
Oh, did I not tell you? <cf>That's why I'm asking for an adventurer.
So, adventurer. Could you please go to <cf>and collect eight Loloa Seaweeds?
There are monsters in that area, <cf>I usually wait until they're gone.
But then I don't know how many days it would take.
I ask you to do the same for me! <cf>Waiting for days is not the way to go!
Please help Nenemarina! <cf>Adventurer, come on, come on!
Oh, have you lost track of what you are collecting?
I know, I know. <cf>You're so laid back, you forget.
The "Loloa seaweed" that grows in "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku"! <cf>Eight of them!　Eight of them!
Immediate!　Immediately, please! <cf>Adventurer, come on, come on!
Oh, welcome back. <cf>I see you picked up some "Loloa seaweed" for me.
Thanks a lot. <cf>I know I'm early, but are you okay?
Yay! <cf>Now you can have your soap made!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Now it's your turn, Nenemarina. Quickly, quickly!
Yes, I know. The fact that we have all the ingredients <cf>means it's time to work.
Okay, I'll start working on it. <cf>Come back when the soap is ready.
Yes, I am interested in this!　Thank you very much! <cf>Well then, I'm off to make arrangements for transport and such!
He's so impatient. <cf>I wonder if he doesn't get tired after running like that.
The forest people are not in a hurry. <cf>They let nature take its course and let the trees grow.
Besides, if you take too much seaweed at once <cf>you'll damage the ocean.
It is important to live in the rhythm of nature. <cf>It is the most natural way to live.
You've come all the way to Jubilia, too. <cf>Spend some time!
Oh, are you relaxing?
When you rest, you rest. <cf>Nature tells you to do so.
Fanny continues to say <cf>["]Come on, come on! ["]"] is all she says, but...
I'm in no hurry to get more soap. <cf>I'm in trouble.
It's important to have your own emotional anchor in the fight <cf>
Because sometimes, at the end of the day, it can bring out <cf>unexpected power.
What do you believe in? <cf>You might want to take a look at yourself for once.
Thank you for accepting my request. <cf>It's not easy to find people to ask for help, so you've been very helpful.
My name is Lakaka, a warrior of the forest people. <cf>I am on patrol in the Valley of the Coral Rocks.
Good quality medicinal herbs and their ingredients can be found there. <cf>Some people go there to pick them from time to time, so we have to keep them safe.
As such a warrior who looks beyond the forest, <cf>I can only speak to you from across the sea.
I actually lost my ...... precious amulet!
I always wear an amulet that I believe in. <cf>And I buy it from the continent you were on.
Many of the foresters use homemade amulets, but <cf>I'm more comfortable with your continental ones.
It's the rare talismans in faraway lands that <cf>should be effective!
However, it seems that he dropped it when he Accepted the monster's <cf>attack in the "Valley of [Coral Rock]".
Of course, I was going to go get it. <cf>But ...... I'd need a good luck charm for that.
I have a talisman, that's what I'm trying to keep in mind. <cf>If I think I don't have it, I get so anxious!
I need to get a new amulet <cf>to find the one I lost.
To do that, I need to meet with a trader and have him show me <cf>a talisman I can believe in!
[--]Mm-hmm, yeah. <cf>I don't know how long this is going to take.
So. Sorry, <cf>you'll have to go find that amulet I lost.
You should be able to find it by doing "Additional Research in the Valley of the Coral Rocks". <cf>Come back when you are done.
I'm asking you! <cf>Now let's go to ...... and look for the amulet!
If you complete the "Additional Research in the Valley of Coral Rocks" <cf>you should be able to find my lost amulet.
When you're done, come back here.
Well ...... I'm off to find my next good luck charm.
Have you finished the "Additional Survey of the Valley of the Coral Rocks"? <cf>Thank you. You did a great job.
Did you find my good luck charm?
Oh!　This ring is exactly the <cf>amulet I lost!
And it's broken in half! <cf>That's fantastic!
Hmm?　You look like you're wondering why it's okay to be broken.
That's because this amulet did its job. <cf>The trader told me when I bought it.
[This ring will protect its owner. <cf>It will surely take your place when your life is threatened ["].
Isn't it just as you said? <cf>That's just the real thing!
I was just meeting with a trader earlier. <cf>I'll have him spruce up the new amulet too.
I was told it was a bit pricey, but I wouldn't hesitate <cf>if it was a real good luck charm!
Thank you very much! <cf>You're the one who taught me the truth about amulets.
I hope you find yourself in good company, my friend!
I just bought a new amulet, <cf>and they recommended a spare amulet too.
Yes, if I lose it again, I'll have a problem when I go to <cf>to look for it. ......
Is it important to have a spare? <cf>No. A spare in case you lose your spare is also ......
There's an old folklore around here <cf>that has been passed down through the generations.
There are <cf>all kinds of stories with forest people in them.
But there are a lot of things that have been passed down [orally] or in vague phrases <cf>
I think we need to keep proper records <cf>for the sake of our descendants.
Hi, nice to meet you. <cf>My name is Omarulu. I'm from the forest.
I'm trying to collect and <cf>document the lore and stories of the area.
Not [oral traditions] or vague legends, but <cf>written records.
If your story is forgotten or <cf>misrepresented, you're screwed.
Besides, it should help our kids and grandkids when they look up old history <cf>
In fact, I'm having a hard time looking it up this way and ....... <cf>I just want to make sure I leave it in the proper form.
So, I wanted the adventurers to help.
I'm currently researching <cf>a story about a bandit who ran away to some cave.
A vicious bandit is trying to get past his <cf>pursuers at the back of a cave where no one comes...
After a while, they would jump out of the cave.
Those who had been chasing the bandit were astonished. <cf>In just a few days he had become like an emaciated old man.
Then, as if he had changed his mind, he changed his mind. <cf>He confessed his sins and was caught meekly.
It's one of those <cf>easy-to-understand sayings that "the wicked will be punished."
The problem is that cave. It's a story passed down around here. <cf>I have no idea where it's from.
Of course, we don't know what happened to the bandits.
So I looked into other stories. <cf>I think that "Sea God's Cavern" is this cave.
Sea God's Cavern" has long been an object of worship for the people of this area, and has appeared in <cf>many stories.
Instead, it's not clear <cf>what kind of place it is.
I'd love to see it, but it's a sacred place and <cf>it seems too dangerous for us to go near.
I want you to go there and check it out. <cf>Sea God's Cavern - Additional Research", please.
I want you to go to <cf>and see what's going on inside the Sea God's Cavern.
It's a place that appears in many stories, but <cf>I've never been in it.
I'd be happy to find any <cf>clues to the events that befell the bandit.
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>How did you like "Sea God's Cavern - Additional Research"?
I'll take notes, so let me hear it ASAP.
...... hmmmmm ...... how to ......
I'd at least heard rumors, but <cf>there really are ruins of Bapharia!
In addition, the inside is filled with ocean water and <cf>monsters also appear ...... and
Yup. Feels a lot like the <cf>cave in the bandit story.
Did the bandit escape from the cave because <cf>he was attacked by a monster, after all?
I heard it was so horrible that it turned him into <cf>an old man.
And if the ruins of Bapharia are involved, <cf>I wouldn't be surprised what happened.
Thanks a lot. <cf>I've made some progress thanks to your adventurers.
When it comes to researching the ruins of Bapharia, <cf>I have to admit, it's a bit beyond me. ......
I'll make sure to keep track of this too <cf>since it's definitely a clue in the lore.
That's what I'm talking about, because your descendants may look at this record and <cf>solve the real mystery.
If I find another interesting story, I'll share it with the <cf>adventurers. See you then.
The foresters live so long, <cf>they tend to tell everything from their own memories.
I've heard it all the time <cf>that people change the content of their stories.
I think the Bapharia civilization and <cf>humans are more solid in that area.
If I praise him too much, he gets mad at me.
We come up with all kinds of new menu items, but <cf>sometimes we revive old menus!
But there are some menu items that I stopped <cf>because I couldn't get the ingredients.
I can't make that kind of thing anymore. <cf>It's a bit sad to say, but it can't be helped.
Hey, Anta!　Thanks for looking after me every time. <cf>Are you eating well?
In fact, one of our regulars, an old man, asked me to <cf>make him some of the lunches I used to make.
I'm moving far away, <cf>and I wanted to enjoy a last taste of my memories.
I'm glad you say that, and I'd love to <cf>make one, but ......
The vegetables I used to put in my lunchbox, they don't pick them anymore.
However, a vegetable I got as a souvenir from Jubilia <cf>called "Salty Greens" tasted the same.
The texture is almost the same. <cf>This would be a great way to recreate the old bento!
Can you please go to <cf>and pick seven "salty greens" at "[Shiotai]chi [beach]" in Cape Rauwehara?
It's your grandfather's request, <cf>and I'd like to make it happen somehow.
I'll pull out the old recipe. <cf>I'll have to prepare something else.
I'm looking forward to working with you, Anta!
I want you to go to "Shiotai" and "Hama" in Cape Rauwehara <cf>and pick up seven "Salty Greens" for me.
For the sake of the regulars, I asked for your best wishes!
Hey, welcome back! <cf>I see you picked some "Salty Greens" for me.
I'm not complaining about the leaves!　I can't complain about the leaf tension and the <cf>freshness!
Plus, this salty taste when you chew it. <cf>It gives it a nice flavor.
I'm sure your regular old man will <cf>appreciate it.
Now, I need to get it as close to the old taste as possible. <cf>That's my job from now on!
Thanks for everything! <cf>I'll be counting on you in the future.
Hey, you! <cf>How are you doing?
I rearranged the old menu and it's <cf>well received and appreciated.
Why don't you try <cf>remembering the old days once in a while?
Baboon......[Outer Continent (Gaitai Continent)] is <cf>interesting with a lot of unusual material.
I sometimes get plants brought from Jubilia <cf>
I'd be interested in this as a compounders. <cf>I can make all kinds of medicines. Hee-hee-hee.
Baboon, I've been waiting for you.
You're as active as ever, aren't you? <cf>You've been well received at the Pioneer Station.
No, no, no. It will be easier for me to make my own transformation potion at <cf>. Hee hee hee.
Actually, I'm in need of another unusual material. <cf>This one can only be found in Cape Rauwehara.
You can find it at <cf>. It's a plant called "water-runner grass.
I was lucky enough to get it the other day. <cf>An unfortunate accident happened and I lost it.
To be precise, the Pioneer Bureau confiscated it. <cf>That's a terrible thing to do, baboon.
The "water-runners" aren't even for sale. <cf>I had to pick them locally.
But I've been on the radar of a few pioneering bureaus <cf>and I don't think I'm going to get on a boat to Jubilia.
So, that's where you come in. <cf>I need you to deliver me about eight "water-runners."
No, I'm not going to hurt you. <cf>You're the only one I can ask. I'm looking forward to working with you. Hee-hee-hee.
Deliver me eight <cf>"Water Running Grass" from the "[Tsukikakushi] no [Yugoku]" in Cape Rauwehara.
If that accident hadn't happened, <cf>I wouldn't have had to bother with you.
Well, some days you just don't have any luck. <cf>Well then, I'm counting on you. Hee-hee-hee.
Oh, "Water Running Grass"! <cf>You're a fast worker, indeed. Hee-hee.
Thanks to you, I'll be able to resume the experiments needed for the makeover drug <cf>. Thank you. Hee hee hee.
Now I'll have to be careful <cf>not to be found by the pioneering bureau. baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon
Hmm?　Is that how it was confiscated by the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>Well, I never told you.
There's a saying that "Water Running Grass," as the name implies, can run on <cf>water if used well.
Depending on what you're transforming with the transformation drug, <cf>it's also important to know if it floats on water, right?
I thought I'd try that one out first. <cf>I just don't know how to do it.
Anyway, I thought I'd put it all over my body and <cf>jump into the ocean.
Then it looks like it was reported. <cf>A green monster appeared on the beach!　That's what they said.
So they took me to the Pioneer Bureau and confiscated <cf>all the "water-run grass" too. Hee hee hee.
It's to make a transformation potion. <cf>It's only natural to have a problem or two like this.
I'm getting to the point where I'm getting good at mixing things up. <cf>I'm sure I'll be indebted to you until the end.
I'll look forward to working with you again sometime. baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
As expected, it's not good to make enemies of the pioneering bureau, <cf>I'll ask for a little indulgence. Hee hee hee.
I'm still a conciliator. <cf>I'll make you some medicine for your wounds and deliver it to you.
It has a rather good reputation. <cf>You might be using it without even knowing it. Hee hee hee.
Ummm ...... I'm not getting any work done.
Don't you think people would rather be <cf>honestly pissed off if they do something wrong?
I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable if I were allowed to do it badly. ......
No, that's for your own convenience. <cf>You're in no position to complain.
I'm sorry this is so pathetic. <cf>I'm not asking for people's help. ......
I got so caught up in work <cf>that I missed a whole day off.
I was supposed to go out with my family, but <cf>I blew it off.
My wife and kids are very understanding, or <cf>they all say ["]I don't care ["]I don't care ["]I don't care ["]I don't care ["]I don't care.
It's the opposite of what I'm used to. ...... <cf>It would be easier if you just got mad at me.
No, let's not. <cf>That's just another seed I planted myself.
Anyway, I want to apologize properly to my family. <cf>But as you know, I'm not a good talker.
The only thing I can move are these two hands. <cf>I thought I'd at least make something to give you.
I've heard that Cape Rauwehara <cf>has some interesting material and anecdotes.
The material is "sea bright hard iron" from "Ia Mole [reef (Gansho)]". <cf>5 pieces would be helpful.
Also, can you get me 5 <cf>"Frost Shell Drops" from Kanikumo Frost in "Ia Mole [Reef]"?
They can make a hard, strong metal, <cf>and they use it to make gifts for their nearest and dearest.
It represents a solid bond, you know? <cf>Simple enough, but just right for me right now.
It's a long trip to "Ia Mole [reef]" <cf>Could you do me a favor? Thank you.
Can you go get me 5 each of "Sea Brilliant Hard Iron" and "Drop of Frost Shell" <cf>
Both can be found at <cf>"Ia Mole [reef]" in Cape Rauwehara.
You can collect "sea-bright hard iron". <cf>For "Drops of Frost Shell," you need to defeat crab spider frost.
I'm sorry to drag you into this for my convenience. <cf>I'm counting on you. Please take care of me.
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I see you brought the material safely.
So this is "Kaihatsu Hard Iron. <cf>I see, it has an unusual texture.
It is a little different from the ore in Asteria Plain. <cf>It's a lot harder.
If combined with "Drops of Frost Shell" <cf>it is said to be even more sturdy!
I think I found such a description in an old weapons record. <cf>Is there a hint of how it was made 400 years ago ......?
Hmm, no!　I'm thinking about work again. <cf>That's not why I asked you to do it.
Use this guy for your family. <cf>Yeah, ...... pots and pans were getting damaged by now.
Our cookware is all old. <cf>I'm going to try to get a whole new set of cookware around here.
Thank you. Thanks to you <cf>I'll be able to do something for my family too.
I'm glad I asked you to do it. <cf>If you ever need anything else, I'll be happy to help.
I'm going to take this opportunity to spend more time talking to my wife and kids <cf>
A first-class adventurer delivers not only materials <cf>but also inspiration.
I guess I've said something that's not in the gala. <cf>Well, that's how grateful I am to you.
Money is not when you don't have it, <cf>and even when you do have it, it's gone quickly.
It's not a good idea to use it on a spur of the moment. <cf>I think that as adults, we need to have self-control!
Have some self-control, adventurers. <cf>Don't imitate my dad.
Adventurer~! <cf>My family's finances are in trouble again~!
You helped me make the <cf>armor plate to sell to the Knights of Bernhardt before.
It wasn't quite an official adoption, but I did get some recognition from the <cf>Knights of Columbus.
So they even got funding from <cf>for higher tech development.
This is finally a relief!　I thought it was ......
My dad ["]wanted one for a while! ["]] <cf>I got a new set of tools, all expensive ones!
Well, expensive tools are easy to use, aren't they? <cf>I've always wanted to touch them.
BUT!　The family's finances are still in a pinch! <cf>Or maybe the situation is worse than before!
There are conditions for funding the Knights. <cf>[The Knights must develop and deliver materials that are useful to the Order.
If I can't do that, they'll take it away from me. <cf>My dad is so busy with his tools that he hasn't done anything!
So! <cf>We need to build new armor plates no matter what!
If this fails, our house will go bankrupt! <cf>But fortunately, we have all the tools we need!
Don't look like a tool only ......!　It hurts my heart!
Please!　I need some help from <cf>adventurers until I get my new armor plate.
First I'm going to try <cf>ore from "[Shiotai]-chi [Hama]" in Cape Rauwehara.
My father heard about it a long time ago. <cf>The old legend of "Tsukikage Sunatetsu" from "Shiotaichi Hama.
The armor that is dotted with small dots in the moonlight will not allow the fangs of any beast to penetrate <cf>[/][......]
I rarely use Cape Rauwehara material, and <cf>think it's worth a try.
Adventurer, go get me five pieces of "Gekkage Sand Iron". <cf>You can pick them up at "Shiotaichi-Hama".
To prevent our bankruptcy and the separation of our family! <cf>Please help us~!
I need you to collect 5 pieces of <cf>"Iron Sand Moonlight" at "[Shiotai]-chi [Hama]" in Cape Rauwehara.
If we don't make and deliver new armor plates, <cf>they will take away the Knights of Columbus' funding!
There may be other materials needed. ...... <cf>First, 5 pieces of "Moonlight Iron Sand", please!
Yay, it's "Moonlight Iron Sand"! <cf>Thank you very much, adventurer!
I wonder if this will be armor that will be so good that it will ["]not let the fangs of any beast pass through["]" <cf>?
In the meantime, I'll use our furnace to make <cf>armored plates. Hold on a sec!
Here you go! <cf>Hmmm, I guess it didn't turn out to be that great a nature.
It is not that strong and not very flexible. <cf>It takes a lot of time and effort, and it is not suitable for mass production.
If it's a big workshop owned by the Order, <cf>a small blacksmith like ours can't handle it.
U~~, I'm so frustrated! <cf>We're supposed to be a store that's necessary for the Principality.
The big workshop isn't the only thing supporting Bernhardt's military power <cf>
One store at a time, or one craftsman at a time. <cf>So many small forces coming together to support the country.
...... small, power?
Huh?　I might have heard something about that. <cf>Dad knew the legend of Cape Rauwehara.
A stone called "Moon Spots". <cf>It's small, but I've heard it used in many places. ......
<span size="Big">--That's it!　That's it! &lt;/&gt;
The "Moon Spots" are small and hard to notice! <cf>Combine that with 'moonlight iron sand'!
Legend also says ["]the armor that was struck with a small dot by the moonlight["]" <cf> So this is what the little dot was all about.
Adventurer!　One more time, please! <cf>Go to "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku" and collect five "Moon Spots"!
Now you can recreate the legend! <cf>I'm sure it will work!
I'm sorry it turned out to be the same job. <cf>You should go to "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku" again.
There is an ore called "Moon Spots" that can be found at <cf>and I need you to collect 5 of them for me.
If we can recreate the legend with this, we should be able to convince the <cf>Knights of Columbus!
It's "Moon Spots."　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Sorry I made you go twice.
I'll use it right away! <cf>I'll let Dad help you this time!
We did it!　We did it, adventurer!
I used "Moonlight Iron Sand" and "Moon Spots" to make <cf>a very sturdy armored plate!
There are some technical challenges, but <cf>I can report this combination of materials to the Knights.
This will fulfill the requirements for financial assistance and <cf>maybe we can get new assistance!
I guess for once I have my dad to thank for that. <cf>And I got the idea from the legend of Cape Rauwehara.
...... No. It's dad's fault for the pinch. <cf>Let's withhold our thanks.
But an extra big thanks to the adventurers! <cf>It was all thanks to your help!
Now that I have all the tools I need, <cf>let's get to work!
Good tools are expensive, but <cf>they're also worth it.
Isn't it the same with adventurers' weapons? <cf>You get excited when you use a good one, don't you...
That doesn't mean we shouldn't spend <cf>money that will tilt our livelihoods!
Tomorrow's weather is ...... mmmm ....... <cf>Sunny ......?　No, cloudy with a hint of rain......?
Hmmm, they say mountain weather is changeable. <cf>Really hard to forecast!
This looks like a worthwhile observation. <cf>It will be interesting to see what valuable records you can gather.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>Thanks for Accepting my request.
Remember me? <cf>I'm Feodor, the scholar who's trying to make weather forecasting a reality.
The road to weather forecasting is still a work in progress ...... and more like <cf>almost a guessing game!
Far from an accurate forecast. <cf>You haven't done enough observation yet.
Under what conditions do temperatures change? <cf>How are cloud movement and humidity related? ......
Even trivial records that are kind of hard to understand, <cf>must be collected and studied steadily.
They used to say the weather in the mountains was changeable. <cf>Montegnor Valley is similar.
If we record a variety of weather here, <cf>it could be useful for future research.
So, I'm looking for a <cf>place to set up my observation equipment!
The top of "Tower Rock" is high and <cf>very favorable conditions!
But the road there is steep and <cf>I couldn't find an accurate map.
The "Tower Rock Mine Site" is particularly troublesome. <cf>Apparently, as they dug, the holes that weren't part of the mining plan widened.
If I wander in, it will be difficult for me to get out.
So, I'd like to ask you, an adventurer, to investigate <cf>the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins".
Gather information and make a map first. <cf>Weather observations should proceed on that basis.
I would like you to conduct the "Tower Rock Mine Site and Survey" and report the results to <cf>. Best regards.
I need you to do a "Tower Rock Mine Site Survey" for me. <cf>I want to get an accurate picture of the topography of that area.
I will proceed with the weather observation after that. <cf>Everything must be done steadily, one step at a time.
When you finish "Tower Rock Mine Site and Survey," come back to me at <cf>to report back to me.
I see you have completed your "Tower Rock Mine Site Survey". <cf>Thank you very much.
Thanks to you, we will be able to make a detailed map. <cf>We will also be able to install observation equipment at "Tower Rock."
We're one step closer to accurate weather observations, and the <cf>map itself should be useful in many areas!
I'm sure your accomplishments will live on for generations to come.
I must make an effort to establish a weather forecast. <cf>If I can predict storms in the mountains, it will lead to great safety.
I've lost family members at sea, but <cf>similar accidents and tragedies can happen on land.
I think we need to work <cf>to reduce even one such story.
Hmmm, I've talked too much. <cf>It's easy to get carried away in front of you.
I may ask you again. <cf>I'll be counting on you then to make the weather forecast a reality.
Weather records collected by "Tower Rock" can be found at <cf>That's pretty interesting.
It is very different from Asterleeds. <cf>I'm sure we'll get different records in other provinces.
I'm also curious about deserts, coasts, and forested areas. <cf>Lots to look into, but I'm a little worried about funding: ......
Huh, Roddy, you're a ....... <cf>How long will you keep noticing me?
Men say catch the stomach first, but <cf>I'm starting to think just catching it isn't enough.
It's <cf>okay if I feed you something that seems to work a little ......, right?
Hello, adventurer. <cf>You've been a great help to me many times. Thank you.
You helped me with my cousin Katya. <cf>She was so grateful for you and Joan and everything.
I was worried too, so I'm really glad! <cf>I just wanted to thank you again.
I'm done with Katya, <cf>and I'd like to make a request today.
I'm looking for some ingredients. <cf>I'm looking for some ingredients that I can't get in Minsterhorn.
I want the <cf>[clam] from Cape Rauwehara's [Shiotai]chi [beach].
It's too far from Minsterhorn, but <cf>adventurers can go to Cape Rauwehara, right?
No other clams will do! <cf>It has to be "shiomaichi clams!
Well, look!　I have some good milk in my house! <cf>It would be great in clam chowder!
So we definitely need 'shiomaichi clams!
That's why I'm asking you! <cf>Shiotaichi clams" are harvested at "Shiotaichi Hama!
Because I want something freshly picked locally! <cf>Best regards!
I need you to go to Cape Rauwehara's [Shiotaichi Beach] <cf>and pick [Shiotaichi clams].
I think five is all we need. <cf>Because other things are never good enough!
See, clams are essential to clam chowder, right? <cf>I must have "shiomaichi clams"!　Please!
I'm so fidgety, Melisu. <cf>Why don't you calm down a little?
I'm not fidgeting!
When the [shioma]chi clams arrive, <cf>I just want to start cooking right away, you know?
Voila!　If the clams are no longer fresh, you'll feel bad for the <cf>adventurers!
Yes, yes, I'll put it that way.
Oh my, ....... Mr. Adventurer.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer!　Welcome back. <cf>Did you get the "Shiotaichi Clam"?
Yay! <cf>This is the real "[shioma]chi clam"!
Yo, okay!　All you need is this: ......
Now all we have to do is get Roddy to eat it and <cf>Melisu's love will come true!
Hey!　Hey, Katya!
Hmmm, actually, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>That clam has a special meaning to me.
It's not as simple as "Shiotaichi clams" because they come from the "Shiotaichi beach" or <cf>.
It is said that the way they patiently stay on the beach until the tide comes in <cf>is like a maiden longing for her lover.
So, there is a legend that if you feed "Shiotaichi clams" to someone you like, <cf>the girl's love will be fulfilled.
Mellis has been looking for clams ever since I told her about it <cf>
But still, clam chowder? <cf>That would require clams, and that's a good idea. Melissa.
I'm sure this will go over great with Roddy.
<span size="Big">Don't talk all the way! &lt;/&gt;
Katya's stupid!　Mean!　You happy guy! <cf>You're lucky you have Joanne, though!
Yes, yes, I'm sorry. <cf>I'll make clam chowder with you.
Mmmmmm~!
Hah ...... too. Thanks anyway, Adventurer. <cf>I'll take good care of my "Shiotaichi Clam".
I'm definitely going to feed Lodi and <cf>make some progress!
I'm going to make clam chowder. <cf>What am I going to tell Roddy to eat?
Eat ["]eat ["]"] doesn't make an impact, and <cf>["]eat ["]eat ["]eat ["]"] doesn't make an impact! [Eat it!" is not enough to make an impact. ......
I mean, what the heck, ......["]ahhh["]? <cf>Caw!　What shall I do, what shall I do?
Oh, dear! <cf>The sheep we raised so carefully have been turned into bandits. ......
If I don't do something about it, I'm in big trouble! <cf>I have to find her as soon as possible!
Boh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You are the adventurer who took care of Elsie, aren't you!
Yes, it's Elsie, the meat butcher! <cf>Look for her!
My name is Lasse. <cf>I'm a scholar who studies and promotes animal husbandry.
Elsie and I are from the same hometown and we are neighbors. <cf>I used to watch her study.
Maybe because I was learning about animals and animal husbandry, <cf>Elsi's passion for livestock was ignited ......
As you know, Elsie's love is a straight line, or rather, it doesn't stop once it <cf>starts running.
Anyway, when it comes to livestock, <cf>I can't brake at all!
This time, sheep raised in Larpal were attacked. <cf>The culprits are bandits.
You understand, don't you?　Yes, it's <span size="Big">human&lt;/&gt;!
If you're dealing with a monster, or even a human <cf>if Elsie starts running at her usual pace, ......!
Please! <cf>Please look for Elsie with me!
Larpal's sheep have been attacked by bandits. <cf>If this continues, we will be in trouble.
Let's find Elsie! <cf>If we don't find her soon, the bandits will be in danger!
Ah!　The adventurer who always helps me! <cf>I'm in trouble!
The bandits bullied the sheep! <cf>They were so cute and helpful and even more delicious!
Like fuzzy hair, or milk for cheese, or <cf>meat that is flavorful whether boiled or baked, or ......
Oh, you bandit!　No. ......
<span size="Big">Human, the, do not forgive! &lt;/&gt;
Don't talk like an evil emperor!
Huh?　Brother? <cf>Brother Lasse, isn't it?
Long time no see, Elsie. <cf>Glad to see you haven't messed with the bandits yet.
So you and your brother are going to punish the bandits together? <cf>Quick, quick, quick battle!　Let's go!
No, the bandits are really in danger if this continues. <cf>We have to distract Elsie somehow. ......
Oh, yes!　It hit me!
Actually, Elsie. <cf>It's a misconception that the bandits attacked the sheep.
The real culprit is someone else. <cf>I know that very well.
Heh?　What do you mean, brother?
Recently, I was doing research on sheep, a domestic animal. <cf>I really needed a specimen for that.
Look, there is a docile sheep nearby. <cf>A poor lamb, kept and tamed by man.
Even an athletic dweeb like me could catch it in no time. <cf>Yes, it was me who attacked the sheep!　I was the one who attacked the sheep!
They were victims of my research! <cf>Ha ha ha!
Oh, no. ...... brother ......!
Okay, if we say I'm the culprit, <cf>even Elsie will hesitate. ......
<span size="Big">Brother the, do not forgive! &lt;/&gt;
<span size="Big">Wait, wait, wait! &lt;/&gt;
Don't hold a beef knife naturally! <cf>And I taught you not to point it at people!
Because your brother bullied the sheep!
It's a figure of speech, or <cf>truth is shown by actions, not words.
Then, I knew it, Mr. Bandit!
I can't say ["]yes["] because it would blow away all the hard work I've done so far. <cf>
<span size="Big">Which is it! &lt;/&gt;
Hey, whatever it was, it got Elsie's attention! <cf>Adventurer, it's now or never!
Bandits can be found in the "Arsenal of the Exiled Country" in the "Free Search" section! <cf>Adventurers, please go and defeat them!
Please hurry! <cf>I too have a limit to how much I can hold Elsie back!
Elsie, no matter how much it's for livestock and the other guy is a scoundrel, <cf>it's not a good idea to just let him be defeated without question.
I don't understand your brother's story because it is difficult!
I'm sure I'm preaching what is rather natural for a human being. <cf>I guess I'm teaching it wrong!
Anyway, adventurers!　It's now!
While I'm attracting Elsie, please go to <cf>[Arsenal of [exile] and free exploration] to defeat the bandits!
Please do!　I won't be on ...... for very long!
Oh, hey, adventurer? <cf>Where have you been?
Defeating bandits in the "Arsenal of the Exiled" ......? <cf>What does that have to do with the sheep?
Eh!　Didn't brother Lasse bully the sheep at <cf>!
Why such lies ...... brother!
(It's all about you, Elsie. ......)
Ha!　Somewhere my brother's voice is coming from: ......
(You wouldn't listen to me if I didn't do this, would you? <cf>You've always been like that. Oh, I miss it. ......)
Brother!　Such a ......! <cf>He was a good man. ......
[--] No, he's alive.
Oh, brother. You're safe.
I exerted all my strength and MND until I passed out, so <cf>I'm not as safe as I say I am, okay?
Don't just study at your desk. <cf>Eat meat every day and exercise!
I think you should hold off on swinging the beef knife for a bit. <cf>I don't think you need to be fast enough to make the blade disappear.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>Thanks to you, we managed to get it under control.
If it weren't for the adventurers, <cf>we would have been in danger in every sense of the word!
Yes, it is dangerous to fight with bandits. <cf>Your brother stopped Atashi, didn't he?
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>That's right!　Since we're here, I'll treat you to a sheep!
I have to go and rustle them up as soon as possible! <cf>I'll be back in a minute, both of you!
As usual, Elsie is doing well. <cf>It's good. It's a good thing, really. ......
Now if only we could put the brakes on our love for each other just a little bit. ......
Anyway, we were lucky that there were no human casualties. <cf>Please continue to support Elshi in the future!
Elsi's enthusiasm for livestock is incredible. <cf>I even respect him for that.
Just a little bit of braking would help: ......
Haha ...... the meat that Elsie cut for me, <cf>delicious as always ......
Work, work, work! <cf>Are you laboring too?
It's good to have a job! <cf>You've got a long life ahead of you, and it's not good to have too much free time on your hands.
Well, a lot of my people are laid back. <cf>I mean, even some of the forest folk like to work.
I'm <cf>a restorer kainalulu of Bapharia's heritage!
How rare is it to find a restorer from the forest? <cf>I'm probably the only one in the whole continent.
I've been taking tools apart and putting them back together and <cf>playing with that kind of stuff for a long time.
I like new and different things. <cf>I don't mind the traditions of the forest, but I'm also curious about outside cultures.
That's why I took a boat over to Asterleeds <cf>to train as a restorer.
So, I opened a business here in Jubilia. <cf>Back home in the woods, we don't use our Bapharia heritage.
On the other hand, Jubilia is a growing village, so <cf>there are lots of jobs for restorers!
Things are different on the Magna continent and over here, and it's interesting, man. <cf>We don't have enough tools and materials for restoration, so we have to be creative ......
...... is not the time to talk about it!
Actually, I'm in a rush right now! <cf>I have some work that is due, and to be honest, I'm in a bad spot!
I'm in this situation and I'm out of material. <cf>I'm too busy to go stock up.
So, could you please go and get the materials? <cf>You should be able to get "Hekiri stone" at "Shiotaichi-Hama".
It's an ore that can only be found around here. <cf>It shines well with the power of engrams.
It's a heritage lamp that's being restored, and <cf>"Hekili Stone" would fit in nicely.
How to restore the object by using available materials as substitutes. <cf>That's what a restorer's skill is all about. ......
So, it was not the time to talk!
Hekiri Stone" can be found at "Shiotaichi-Hama". <cf>Go and gather eight for now!
I'll take care of the other jobs! <cf>Come on, hurry up and work~!
Go to "[Shiotai]-chi [Hama]" in Cape Rauwehara <cf>and collect 8 "Hekiri Stones"!
I can't meet the deadline if I don't do this! <cf>Please help me~!
Oh, you brought the "Hekili Stone" with you!
Oh no, that was helpful! <cf>I just finished up some other business.
Now we can meet the deadline. <cf>Now let's finish the final restoration!
This is the heritage lamp you asked for. <cf>It looks like a rather odd mold.
The inside construction is totally different from other lamps, so <cf>I started by researching how to repair it!
It was a lot of work to get to the "Hekili Stone". <cf>But this kind of trial and error is the fun part of the job!
Speaking of fun, here's a lamp. <cf>It doesn't just light up the lamp, you know?
I don't know where it is, but <cf>it projects a view of another location onto the wall.
If you light this lamp in a dark room, <cf>you will instantly be transported to a distant exotic landscape!
Wow - that's a legacy, isn't it?
I'm curious to see how it works and where the landscape is <cf>I'm also curious and excited, man!
Oh yeah, speaking of curious. <cf>This guy seems to have drifted in from Ulrau Village.
Ulrau [Village] is a settlement of forest people. <cf>They're not supposed to bring in Bapharia's heritage.
A heritage lamp said to have been in such a place. <cf>Moreover, it comes with a device that locks in an exotic landscape!
Duh, I'm curious!
Maybe an adventurer like you will <cf>one day solve the mystery.
Thank you!　If you find a legacy that needs restoration <cf>, let me know and I'll take care of it!
Oh no, they're bringing in all kinds of heritage restorations. <cf>That alone is going to be fun!
Take it apart, put it back together, and think about it again: ....... <cf>It's great, no boredom!
I wonder if in the time of the Bapharia civilization, <cf>everyone did this.
I know it doesn't fit with the forest people's thinking. <cf>As for me, I'm jealous of the old timers!
The forest people are accustomed to hunting. <cf>They've been chasing prey in the woods since they were young.
Many of us are hunters in Jubilia as well. <cf>And they're not very good at business or anything else.
Hunters are not only hunting their prey, but also <cf>preparing for monsters!
Those of us who can handle weapons, like us, also have a responsibility to protect our <cf>villages.
I am Hohoi, a hunter from Jubilia. <cf>Thanks for Accepting my request.
Recently, my hunting buddies <cf>were attacked by monsters in rapid succession.
The opponent is an earth skyfish. <cf>I hate to say it, but it's not a tough catch.
And yet, they got their best guys, too.
The people of the forest are accustomed to hunting. <cf>Because they grow up using the forest as a hunting ground from an early age.
So did my father, and I myself <cf>My father taught me everything from the basics of hunting.
Even my father, such a father, was unaware. <cf>Besides, he said the strangest things.
["]Earth Skyfish didn't make a sound ["]," he said. <cf>They didn't hear any noise at all and were caught off guard.
The other fellows say similar things. <cf>But they are forest people too.
It's hard to imagine that all of us living in the forest would miss the sound of our prey <cf>
So I will try to find out the cause. <cf>If we don't, the village will be in danger.
The hunter is not only responsible for hunting his prey, <cf>but also for protecting the village from monsters!
I need you to go to "[Shiotai]chi [Hama]" <cf>and take down about 4 Earth Skyfish.
I just need you to check <cf>in person to see if you really can't hear the sound.
My arms can't protect the village and make <cf>sure of the sound. Sorry.
Come back to me when you have finished defeating them. <cf>Sorry for the hassle, but thank you in advance.
I need you to go to <cf>and take down about 4 earth sky fishes in [shioma]chi[hama].
My friends say ["]nothing sounded ["]but <cf>want you to make sure that's true!
Sorry, but I'm looking forward to working with you.
You took down the Earth Skyfish. <cf>That was helpful. Thank you.
My friends said ["]it didn't sound ["] <cf>What about you?
From the looks of it, nothing seems to have changed. ...... <cf>Seems like they could hear the sounds too.
I see. Then the cause must be my father and <cf>his friends.
Actually, there's one thing I'm curious about.
I checked <cf>to see if anything unusual had happened recently, and my dad was buying jewelry.
The continent over there, ...... the continent of Magna, huh? <cf>He bought it from a merchant in the city you came from.
He was going to give it to me <cf>to add a little color to my not-so-pretty life.
Well, let's put my father's feelings aside. <cf>The problem is the jewelry.
I brought this up a while ago. <cf>It's lost its luster and is dull.
But when my father bought it, it shone beautifully. <cf>And just before you returned, the shine was gone.
In addition, the time when my friends were killed by the Earth Skyfish coincides with the time <cf>my father bought the jewelry.
I find this jewelry suspicious. <cf>I would return it to the merchant if possible.
I heard that there is a liner coming to the port. <cf>Could you look for the merchant with me?
I'm not very good at recognizing people's faces. <cf>It would help me if you could follow me.
I want to find the merchant who sold me this jewel. <cf>I think I can find him at the port.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Is there something you need?
Have a question about gemstones? <cf>What kind of gemstone is it?
It's this gemstone. <cf>It was purchased by a hunter of the forest people.
Oh, this gem! <cf>Oh good, I was looking for a customer!
Actually, after returning to Asterleeds, <cf>I found out the hard way.
I just wanted to tell my customers: <cf>I came back to Jubilia in a big hurry!
What do you mean? <cf>There's something about this gem.
Yeah, there's a saying. <cf>Wait a minute, I've transcribed it.
I leave you with a note about the five-colored gemstones that bring curses."
'The five-colored gems, though they be divided, <cf>flow about in search of one half.'
White gems keep sound away. <cf>It muffles the sound of sound and brings absolute silence."
That's consistent with my father and his friends being soundly beaten and the light going out after <cf>you took them down.
You, the merchant. <cf>So you are saying that this is a cursed jewel?
I am sorry, I did not know about this. <cf>I will take it back here and now.
We will, of course, return your payment and <cf>leave your jewelry with the Pioneering Bureau.
No, you are not at fault. <cf>Thank you for your honesty in confiding in me.
I will tell my father what happened. <cf>I know exactly what happened to my friends.
Maybe we had our pride. <cf>Now that we know that, we can't dismiss the gems as evil either.
Anyway, let's give this one back to you. <cf>I hope there won't be any more commotion.
Yes, sir. <cf>We will certainly take it back.
I took care of you, the adventurer. <cf>Thank you for all your help.
Many of the people of the forest are not [well versed] in worldly affairs. <cf>I would be glad to have someone like you to help us.
If you get a call for help in the woods, <cf>please lend a hand.
To get carried away by a single gemstone. <cf>We don't have enough training either.
It's not just about hunting skills. <cf>You've got to train your unwavering heart, too.
Here we are, Cape Rauwehara! <cf>Hmmm, I think I have a good idea!
Anne. It's not free to come here. <cf>We also borrowed money for our trip, so save your money.
Shea is such a worrier. <cf>She'll pay back the travel expenses in full!
I'm more worried about the ones who use it in a perked up way with weird ideas <cf>......
Welcome to the new product development of inventors Anne &amp; Shea! <cf>You're all familiar with us, adventurers.
Sorry to disturb you every time, adventurer. <cf>I have finally made it across the sea.
Wow, it's hot when you get to Cape Rauwehara! <cf>It's so different from Asterleeds.
Now, isn't there something you crave more when it's hot?
Yes, I do. <cf>I'd love to have a cold one.
Tch tch, that's a normal idea, Shea! <cf>Ideas are always hidden behind common sense.
When it's hot, it's time for something warm! <cf>And not just food or something boring like that, but something with a twist!
Let's make a luxury down quilt!
Did you come up with the idea of a down quilt because of this heat? <cf>I'm starting to sweat just thinking about it.
That's right. A good sweat is good for your health and <cf>refreshes your mind!
Oh, I'm not going to sell it here, indeed? <cf>I'll sell it in Kanaloa or someplace cooler, don't worry!
And it's a very popular futon among children. <cf>What do you think?　Isn't it a new point of view?
Popular with kids?　What's the logic?
It's, you know, a mind-pecker!
Have you ever seen them, adventurers? <cf>A bird-like monster with a silly face.
And if you don't piss them off, they're surprisingly friendly. <cf>They sing in funny voices, and they're cute.
They're in picture books, they're in children's products and other <cf>designs.
As for me, I think he has the <cf>potential to fight with Nappo-kun and Yee!
Um, Anne?　It's a down comforter, right?
Yes, it's a comforter with <cf>plenty of Mindpecker feathers!
Fluffy, warm and comfortable! <cf>It's like sleeping with Mindpecker!
Kids play with Mind Pecker too <cf>because they can dream happy dreams!
No, the key is that the mindpeckers are <cf>feathering ......
So, adventurers! <cf>I need you to go gather some materials.
Go to <cf>and get a "Talking Bird's Feathers" from Mind Pecker at "Shiotaichi [Shiotaichi] Hama [Hama]".
Hah ....... Once you get into this mode <cf>you won't be able to convince Anne.
Sorry, Adventurer, but I need 10 <cf>"Chattering Bird Feathers", please!
We will pay you well.
You can get <cf>"Talking Bird Feathers" from the mind peckers in "Shiotaichi [Shiotaichi] Hama [Hama]".
First, 10 sheets for prototyping! <cf>Best regards, adventurer!
As always Anne, thank you for your time at <cf>
We are running out of money for travel expenses, but we will have a separate reward for <cf>adventurers.
Ah, welcome back! <cf>You finished collecting already?　That's great!
It's a "talking bird feather" as requested. <cf>Thank you, adventurer.
You did it, thanks!　 <cf>Now you can make your very popular duvet!
First of all, you have to unwind these feathers ......, huh? <cf>Is this what bird feathers look like?
The one in the futon looks <cf>like it was more fluffy ......
It's <cf>mainly waterfowl breast feathers that are used for down quilts.
It's highly heat-retentive to keep you cool in cold water and <cf>moisture-absorbing to keep your hair damp!
In the feathers of birds that live in hot regions, everything is the opposite!
And the fibers are strong, so <cf>I'm sure it will go through the comforter.
Again, no such thing as a feather penetrating the fabric. ......
<span size="Big">Ouch!　It stung! &lt;/&gt;
Please don't hurt yourself anymore. ......
Adventurer, thank you so much <cf>for hanging out with Anne!
As usual, you stopped at ideas. <cf>I hope you learn before you hurt yourself. ......
Damn!　It's only a bird's feather! <cf>If you rub it hard, it should soften up in time!
<span size="Big">Gosh gosh gosh gosh gosh! &lt;/&gt;
Wait, what kind of speed are you rubbing at! <cf>There's smoke coming out!
A hot flame of passion is essential for new product development! <cf>See, see, it's burning!
You really don't need to flame up! <cf>Let go of me, you'll burn yourself!　Anne!
It hit me!　Why don't we just put the whole mindpecker in the <cf>futon?
Then we'll have the perfect big popular futon! <cf>Alright, let's go get them!
There's no way I'm going to stay quiet! <cf>Come to your senses Anne!　Stop ...... Stop it!
Long ago, in Cape Rauwehara, <cf>there was a god different from the god of Bapharia.
[It's called "Wadatsumi," or "sea god," and it's still an old belief at <cf>.
Sea God's Cavern" and "Kahuna Cave" are sacred places where <cf>[Sea God's Cavern] is worshipped and prayers are offered.
Adventurers, please remember to be grateful to the sea from time to time. <cf>[The god of the sea watches over us from beyond the sea.
Adventurers from across the sea. <cf>Please lend me your strength!
My name is Mimi Olina. <cf>I serve God in Cape Rauwehara.
When I say God, I don't mean the God of Bapharia. <cf>I mean another God that has a long tradition in this land.
[He is called "Wadatsumi-sama" (the sea god). In ancient times, Cape Rauwehara was <cf>protected by this [sea god].
It is the blessing of the [sea god] that people are blessed with seafood, sea breezes, and a warm climate <cf>
Bapharia is the mainstream religion now, but there is still a belief in the <cf>[sea god] in this land.
I am one of them. I serve the [sea god], <cf>called 'kahuna' in the old language.
We kahunas are responsible for praying to the sea god and offering <cf>offerings when the occasion arises.
However, it seems that the <cf>monsters have ravaged that precious offering!
It seems that the Guillemie Warrior in "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku" <cf>took the offerings. ......
There are some important places for the Sea God's Cavern and Kahuna Cave <cf>around there.
It's unacceptable for <cf>Kahuna to be trolled by Gilmey and his friends!
Please!　Defeat the Gilmy Warrior and get back <cf>"An Offering to the [Sea God (Wadatsumi)]"!
The Guillemie Warrior in Tsukigakushi should have <cf>an offering to the God of the Sea.
[I can't allow you to take away something so precious to me. <cf>Please take it back!
You got back the "Offering to the God of the Sea"! <cf>Thank you so much, adventurer!
Oh, I'm so relieved. <cf>I have to pray to the [sea god] once again.
[The sea god also had a rough side. <cf>You see, the sea is not always calm, right?
In the old days, it was believed that storms and maritime disasters were brought about <cf>by the wrath of the [sea god].
The [sea god] has protected this land, but he has also <cf>caused hardship and trials.
At that time, the god of Bapharia appeared and appeased the <cf>[sea god] and appeased his anger.
[The god of the sea left this land to the gods of Bapharia and went back to <cf>the other side of the sea.
is a fairy tale passed down in the Bapharia religion. <cf>Local lore is a little different.
The truth is that a village girl offered herself as a sacrifice to appease the <cf>[sea god].
Since then, we have been making offerings to the [sea god]. <cf>So that we will not need sacrifices again.
From a kahuna standpoint, I'm a little disappointed that <cf>[Sea God (Wadatsumi)]-sama has left us, but ......
I am sure He is still watching over <cf>Cape Rauwehara from across the sea!
The adventurer who came across the sea, <cf>maybe [sea god] sent him to us?
If so, I'm kind of glad. <cf>Thank you for helping me. I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.
May the sea bless you, adventurer. <cf>I pray that the sea will help you.
Blessings to you, adventurers, from the God of the Sea. <cf>May the blessings and mercy of the sea be with you.
The God of Bapharia is a great being, but sometimes you have to remember <cf>[God of the Sea]'s will too!
Jubilia is getting more crowded and <cf>more lively!
But as the city grows <cf>problems can arise.
Security could be compromised, <cf>new diseases could be spread, and so on.
Apparently there was such a time in the forests of my hometown. <cf>I guess you can never be too prepared.
Hello and welcome to Jubilia. <cf>I hope you are enjoying your stay to the fullest.
My name is Maurili. I'm one of the people of the forest, <cf>and I like it here so much that I've settled in.
Our hometown is in the forest, further into the [outer continent] <cf>from here.
Many of the foresters live there, but <cf>the odd ones like me leave their hometowns.
The winds of Jubilia, where we can live with humans, <cf>somehow get under my skin.
Such is the wind in Jubilia. <cf>It's been a little unpleasant lately.
I guess it's the feeling of the forest people. <cf>Sometimes I get a hunch about these things.
Usually when something bad happens in the village.
Some people were coughing and <cf>apparently an epidemic is coming.
I am also a druggist. <cf>Because of my job, I'm especially sensitive about illnesses.
We want to make medicine before the epidemic starts in earnest. <cf>So I need your help, Mr. Adventurer.
I need you to collect materials at "Ia Mole [Reef]". <cf>They are called "Tamarulu grass" and "Stirrup seaweed.
Five of each will suffice for now. <cf>I want you to look for plants and water points.
I'll get the other materials and tools ready. <cf>Before the disease really takes off, please.
I want you to collect materials at "Ia Mole [Reef]". <cf>Tamarulu grass" and "Stirrup seaweed".
Five of each will suffice. <cf>I want you to try to collect plants and riparian points.
Please do us all a favor before the disease gets out of control in earnest.
Hello, adventurer. <cf>I see you've collected the ingredients for the potion.
Thanks a lot. <cf>I think I can keep the epidemic under control now.
I'll get the drugs ready as soon as possible. <cf>With the number of residents increasing, we need to figure out a way to mass produce them.
It's good that Jubilia is getting bigger. <cf>But with it comes problems.
The more people, the more commotion. <cf>Like this case of disease and crime.
Apparently there was such a time in the forest people's homeland. <cf>Back in the day, when they took in people from the outside.
Jubilia is actively welcoming people, so I wouldn't be surprised if <cf>the same thing happens there.
If so, I'm sure the experience and insight of us foresters <cf>will be of some use!
We humans and forest people are living together. <cf>We should join forces with each other.
Thanks a lot. <cf>I'm glad I was able to get some help from the adventurers.
I hope we can all continue to work hard for the development of Jubilia at <cf>
Some people are getting a little sick, but <cf>the disease outbreak is under control throughout the village.
The medicine seems to have worked. <cf>I guess this is a relief for a while.
You're traveling, too? <cf>I'm on the road, too.
I'm going to go to Bernhardt now and join the <cf>Knights of the Order and be very active!
I'd start by making connections with the Knights of Columbus. <cf>I heard there's a guy from the Knights of Columbus somewhere: ......
My name is Joel!　I'm a traveler!
I'm not running away from home!　I'm traveling! <cf>Make no mistake about that, okay?
Adventurers travel around too, don't they? <cf>I love it. It's hard to leave an adventurer behind, isn't it?
But that's not what I'm here for. <cf>I want to go to the Principality of Bernhardt!
I'm going to join the Knights of Bernhardt and <cf>do great, great things!
That way, Dad and Mom <cf>wouldn't be able to scold me.
So I'm trying to make connections to the Order.
I'm sure someone from the Knights of Bernhardt is in the village, and <cf>an adult adventurer with you would be willing to listen to what you have to say.
Let's find the knights first. <cf>Nice to meet you!
I think someone from the Order of Bernhardt is in Jubilia at <cf>
With adult adventurers, <cf>I'm sure they'll listen to me!
Find someone from the Order of Bernhardt at <cf>with me. Please!
Hmm?　Huh? <cf>Hey, you!　You must be the adventurer from back then!
Remember us? <cf>We're Bernhardt's former deserters.
Oh!　Thanks for that. <cf>Sorry to have bothered you.
I've had people help me carry my stuff for me, <cf>I've had people rescue my partner from monsters, and so on.
We've been back to the Knights since then <cf>and we're starting over from scratch.
You'll have to start over with menial tasks and chores. <cf>Don't worry. I won't run away again.
Hey, are these guys from the Order? <cf>They don't even have swords. Aren't they from that area?
What's with the kid?　Lost?
My name is Joel! <cf>I came here to join the Order of Bernhardt!
Huh?　You came here to join the Order? <cf>Don't do it, don't do it. You kids go play with your friends.
That's right, there are some scary instructors. <cf>Come when you're bigger.
No, I'm definitely going to join the Order! <cf>If you guys can get in, why can't I?
I'm not going to desert! <cf>I'll be a better knight than you!
What the hell, you little brat!
Hmmm, sometimes there are kids like this. <cf>How do I get them to leave?
No, no, no, Lucas. If you're going to go that far, <cf>let's let them experience the work of the Order of the Knights.
We'll show you how hard it is to be a knighthood!
Henshin, I wish! <cf>If you do your job right, you'll be inducted into the Order.
Oh, it's getting messy. ...... <cf>Sorry, adventurer. I need your help again.
I don't think Klaus would be reckless, but I'm sure <cf>you'll keep an eye on him.
All right!　Let's start with a look around. <cf>Let's go check the village to see if there's anything out of the ordinary.
That's a piece of cake!　Let's get the hell out of here!
Sorry to drag you into this. <cf>We'll follow you both.
First, we're going to take a look around. <cf>Let's go check the village for anything out of the ordinary.
Easy peasy!　Let's get the hell out of here!
Oh dear, ....... Sorry, adventurer.
I'm worried about these two alone. <cf>I need you to come with me.
All right, kid!　Let's start looking around. <cf>You notice anything?
There's nothing here. <cf>I think it's just a mess of trash and dirt.
Oh, you see the garbage too. <cf>So what do you do with that garbage?
I didn't throw it away. <cf>I didn't throw it away. I had nothing to do with it.
Too bad, you little shit! <cf>Cleaning up trash is a fine job for the Knights!
You must maintain the beauty and cleanliness of the village! <cf>Of course, cleaning is part of the job.
Ehh~!　That's not cool!
Don't mess with me!　Come on, let's do it!
Damn!　I can't help it!
Okay, thanks for your hard work! <cf>You did a good job of cleaning up after all the complaining.
You're surprisingly honest, Joel. <cf>You might have a prospect.
Hey, let me do something cooler than that! <cf>I mean, if you're a knighthood, you're supposed to be on a mission to fight.
Do you think you've heard this somewhere before?　Klaus.
Ugh, shut up!　I'm sorry about that time.
We can't take them down, but can we at least <cf>manage to take them on a scouting mission?
Yes, it is. If only we could see it from afar.
All right, kid! <cf>Next, we'll scout for monsters.
Reconnaissance is a mission to gather information and use your head. <cf>Can you show us that fighting is not the only thing you can do?
Of course!　Of course! <cf>I'll do a full reconnaissance!
Did I say that? <cf>Then we'll race to "Ia Mole [the reef]!
I'm sorry to keep coming back to you, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to come with me to "Ia Mole. <cf>Please come with me to Ia Mole.
Next, we'll go to "Ia Mole [reef]" to scout for monsters. <cf>Leave it to me!
Hey, don't go first! <cf>Don't ever go near a monster!
Can you come to the "Ia Mole [reef]" too? <cf>We can't handle it if the monsters come after us.
I can't let Joel get hurt. <cf>I just need a little more help.
Oh, awww... ....... <cf>Monsters are so many of them!
Hey, relax. It's okay. <cf>I'm not going to hurt you if you stay here.
That was a little unexpected. <cf>I found Gilmey, our reconnaissance target.
There are more of them than reported. <cf>It's too dangerous to go near that thing with kids.
If it's just us, we can't <cf>put this kid in danger.
O, don't worry about me, <cf>just get it over with!
I thought the Knights shouldn't run away! <cf>You have to fight and get rid of the monsters!
Shut up and think about it! <cf>There's no way we can win, unarmed!
The work of the Order involves danger! <cf>It is an ironclad rule of thumb to work with safety first!
If I injure you, it would be a disgrace to the Order. <cf>You understand that, don't you?
Umm, yeah. Okay. ......
We're going back with the kid. <cf>In the meantime, I need you to take down Gilmy.
If you can draw them away, <cf>we can get away safe with the kids.
Sorry to put you through the wringer again. <cf>I'll apologize as much as I can later.
Klaus is not the only one. <cf>Let me bow down too.
Anyway, the priority is to evacuate Joel. <cf>We're back in Jubilia.
Let me join you in Jubilia! <cf>I'm sure your strength will be fine, I'm counting on you!
The safety of this kid is our top priority. <cf>We're taking him with us to Jubilia.
Anta take down Gilmey and <cf>get their attention.
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. <cf>Please take care of me!
Good job! <cf>You took down Gilmey.
I knew it. You're amazing! <cf>After all that fighting, you're still going strong.
The Knights ask the adventurers to take them down? <cf>The Knights are stronger, right?
Klaus has messed with monsters before and <cf>got away with it!
That's where this adventurer saved me.
Oh, it's a shameful memory. <cf>But it can't be helped that it's true.
So you're saying that adventurers are more awesome than knights?
It doesn't. <cf>It's just that we all have our roles to play.
We did our part to keep you out of harm's way. <cf>We ran and you, the adventurer, fought.
It's not about who's better. <cf>Well, maybe it's cooler to fight.
I don't want you to see "The Strong Order", I want you to see <cf>"The Way of Life of the Order".
The Knights' Way of Life: ......
You ran away from home anyway, didn't you? <cf>Go talk to your mom and dad first.
I'm one of those people who ran away from home and other things I didn't like. <cf>It didn't do me any good at all.
Not the kid ......, but the traveler Joel. <cf>Your first mission is to talk to your parents!
If you can't do that, you can't call yourself Joel of the Order <cf>!　Wahaha!
Hey, what the hell? <cf>All right, all right!　I'll go talk to him!
If Dad and Mom say it's okay, <cf>I'll work with you guys on the Knights of Columbus!
Oh, yeah, sure!　Come anytime!
Oh dear, looks like it's all settled somehow. <cf>Thanks for your help, too.
Klaus seems to be becoming more aware of his knighthood. <cf>It's all thanks to meeting you.
You'll be helping a lot of people besides us. <cf>Good luck on your journey!
Hey, hey, what are you doing today? <cf>Pick up trash?　Fix the wall?
I want to do it with you! <cf>Let me train you in the knighthood!
Oh, God!　Shut up! <cf>How do you keep coming back day after day without getting tired of it?
I'm getting kind of nostalgic. <cf>Well, it's the knighthood's job to protect a boy's dreams.
Oh, kind adventurer. <cf>We meet again.
Thank you for your help on that occasion. <cf>You see, you disposed of the body, didn't you?
Have you seen Mr. Koshimo since then? <cf>I have not seen him.
Mmm-hmm. Please don't look at me like that. <cf>It was a "dead pig" that you threw away.
Or [--]did you imagine <cf>something else?
Hmmm. Well, we can talk about that.
Actually, I'd like to discuss something with the adventurer at <cf>
I'm having trouble getting <cf>items from a blacksmith I know well.
It's a small blacksmith shop in Kanaloa. <cf>He forges good blades.
The work is never late and <cf>is a very reliable store!
I'd like to go check on him once I get there. <cf>It would be unwise for the child to be alone, wouldn't it?
We may need the help of an adventurer <cf>and would like you to come with us.
Adventurers don't leave <cf>a child in trouble, do they?
Of course, if nothing else, that would be best. <cf>Ummm. Well then, I look forward to working with you.
I'm having a little trouble <cf>getting my items from the blacksmith in Kanaloa.
I would like to go to <cf>to see what's going on, will you join us?
If you're having trouble, <cf>I'd be happy to help you and your adventurers.
I look forward to working with you
Oh, welcome. Hey, adventurer.
I would say ......, but sorry. <cf>We're not Accepting any new orders right now.
It's been a while, master. <cf>It's always been a pleasure to serve you.
Oh?　It's Niki, isn't it? <cf>You came all the way from Asterleeds?
Yes, I am. I thought it was <cf>unusual for the master to delay delivery so long.
I was just wondering if something was wrong.
Thanks for that. <cf>I'm glad you patronize a poor workshop like ours.
Sorry about that, though. I'm in a bit of a bind and can't make <cf>a satisfactory product.
The warehouse was attacked by proto-machina. <cf>They uprooted all my blacksmithing tools.
I've been using it for years, and it's [become] comfortable in my hands. <cf>With alternative tools, the quality is inevitably lower.
I'm trying out a few things, but <cf>I'm far from being able to serve them to my customers.
Did the protomachina take the master's tools?
You don't look at anything else, just the <cf>blacksmithing tools?
Yeah, I had some materials left over. <cf>So I can handle the blacksmithing itself.
I'm in a bind. <cf>At this rate, we'll have to think about closing the business.
Don't be so hasty. <cf>You don't have to worry about your master's skill.
Besides, if we get our tools back <cf>there's nothing wrong with that, right?
We have some adventurers we can rely on. <cf>I'll be happy to discuss it with you in a bit.
Well, I appreciate that, but ...... <cf>we're dealing with a proto-machina.
Mr. Adventurer is still a child, <cf>Niki is still a child. Don't be reckless.
I understand. <cf>I'll just do my part.
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Why don't we have a little chat over there?
If I can get my blacksmithing tools back, <cf>I can still do business as before.
It was Proto Machina who took the tools. <cf>It's not something an amateur can do anything about.
Adventurer, I need your advice on Niki. <cf>I think we need to talk about something.
Don't be too reckless. <cf>Niki, you're just a kid.
Well, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I've heard something that's been bothering you.
The protomachina may attack people. <cf>But it does not take people's tools!
Such a thing would not be of any benefit to the proto-machina <cf>
But if there is someone who is a business rival of the master, <cf>I am sure that person will benefit from it!
Did you know that the Knights of Bernhardt are using the Machina as a force <cf>
That is because we have the technology to control the machina. <cf>Of course, it's military classified, so it can't be used by outsiders.
But no matter what the secret, <cf>where there is a leak, there is a leak
For example, if a person who was in the Order of the Knights <cf>becomes a brigand or a thief, he or she will become a ......
You may be able to control the Machina or Proto Machina at <cf>
Of course, these are my guesses. <cf>I have no proof of this.
So I will look into that. <cf>I was thinking of asking the adventurers for a proto-machina.
I just looked at the master's warehouse a few minutes ago. <cf> You found traces of [PM (proto-machina)] Mook.
It seems that <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Mook, who is in "The Abandoned Mines of Noxious Miasma, Free Exploration", has taken the master's tools!
Can adventurers please go to <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Mook in the "Abandoned Mines of Miasma, Free Search"?
That way, he could get his master's tools back.
I'll leave you to it for a moment. <cf>I have an idea about the "human" one, so...
I'm going to ask you a few questions. <cf>Please tell your master when you are done. Good bye.
It seems that <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Mook, who is in "The Abandoned Mines of Noxious Miasma, Free Exploration", has taken the master's tools.
Adventurer, can you help us take down the enemy? <cf>I think I can get my master's tools back.
I'll visit another mind. <cf>I'd like to ask you a few questions.
When you defeat [PM (proto-machina)] Mook, please tell <cf>your master and reassure him.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>What's the matter?
This is my blacksmithing tool, isn't it? <cf>Did you get it back for me?
Thanks for the help! <cf>But where the hell did you find it?
Huh?　Niki told you to go to <cf>to take down the proto-machina?
I'm sorry to have put you through all that trouble. <cf>Niki is a reckless person.
But what if they come back? <cf>There's a limit to how sturdy you can make a warehouse. ......
Don't worry about that.
Thank you for your hard work, adventurer. <cf>I see that you were able to put away the proto-machina.
Parents. The monsters won't show up anymore and <cf>won't happen to hinder your business!
Please put your mind at ease and get to work!
Really? <cf>Well, I'd appreciate that. ......
What did Niki do for you?
No, thanks to the adventurers who took down the proto-machina <cf>
I have nothing. As long as you do your job <cf>without a hitch, that's all that matters.
The blades forged by my master are first class. <cf>We are waiting for you to deliver them to us again.
Yeah, okay! <cf>We've got our tools back and we're back in business.
Thanks, adventurer! <cf>If you ever need anything done with your blacksmithing, just let me know!
Thanks to your help, we have solved the problem. <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
The protomachina would have been left as is if nothing else <cf>
They were defeated because of human involvement. <cf>Of course, it wasn't the adventurer's fault.
More horrifying than monsters and Bapharia's legacy, <cf>is the human race. Don't you agree.
But those who were hiding behind the scenes <cf>are no longer out in the open!
It seems that the master's work was an eyesore. <cf>I'm a little overzealous.
Hmmm... You have such a scary face. ...... <cf>You are a terrible person, adventurer.
It's as if I'm being told that I'm the one who's going to be ringed with the horror <cf>horror ......
I just needed the master to do his job. <cf>I wouldn't want anyone to get in the way of that.
Tools that fit comfortably in your hands are essential to your work. <cf>Isn't that what your master said?
Trying to take that away from people is not something I'm very impressed with <cf>
Take care, adventurers. <cf>Please take good care of both people and tools, ugh.
So long, and see you soon. <cf>Have a good day, kind adventurer.
I used to fight a lot in the Arena.
The building itself is a legacy of Bapharia, or so I've heard. <cf>You can fight all kinds of monsters and train with them.
Monsters are recreated just like in Imagine. <cf>I don't know how it works.
You can also fight with monsters in the [outer continent]. <cf>When you think about it, it's a good training facility.
'Cape Rauwehara Expeditionary Training Supplies <cf>Asterleeds Security Forces'
These are supplies for long-term expeditions. <cf>Please handle with care."
<span size="Big">'Don't come home until you beat them all! &lt;/&gt;
[--]The intense heat seems to be coming through. <cf>But is it okay for supplies to be left behind?
If I see Guard Captain Eubank, I'll let him know at <cf>just in case.
Hey, it's you! <cf>You're getting better and better, aren't you?
I hope my men in the Guard will grow up to be <cf>like you.
I'm having them train an expedition right now. <cf>I'm sending them to Cape Rauwehara.
However, it seems they are having a bit of a hard time. <cf>Oh, man, I'm so pathetic. Can you lend me a hand?
Oh, thank you. <cf>Well, in a nutshell, I'm pulling my guys up.
You're supposed to go to <cf>and kill monsters in "Shiotaichi Hama."
There are many enemies and sand underfoot. And it's hot. <cf>A perfect environment for training, right?
Of course, don't come back until you've beaten them all! I said ["] <cf>with a sour taste in my mouth.
They really don't come back at all. <cf>It's like they're having a hard time taking them down.
It's fine if they don't come back. <cf>It's good that you're not running away, but it's also good that you're not staying in town forever.
Huh?　A box with supplies for an expedition is left at <cf>port?
So, what does that mean? <cf>You mean they're training without a good supply.
They're good, aren't they? <cf>If that's how you've managed to stick with it so far, I'm impressed!
Wait a minute. Isn't this good training? <cf>If we leave him alone, he's going to learn a lot of guts, isn't he?
Hahaha, just kidding! <cf>Running out of food is a bad idea!
Being hungry is the worst situation. <cf>For once, my men have done well.
Well, let's get on with retrieving them! <cf>Let's meet up in Jubilia first.
I'll probably clean up the monsters I missed, though. <cf>We'll talk about that when we get to Jubilia.
My men are on an expedition to Cape Rauwehara <cf>[Shiotai] and [Hama].
There's no supplies either. <cf>I'd better let them pull out, as expected.
Let's go to Jubilia for now. <cf>We'll see what we can do there.
Hey, good job! <cf>I found your men in expedition training.
You've been heckled. <cf>I'm collecting it and letting it rest for now.
Well, I heard he fought without eating or drinking. <cf>A little credit where credit is due.
It seems that the <cf>villagers were saved because these guys got rid of the monsters.
I'm talking about the Swan Plizzard and Ignis Lizard, <cf>two types of monsters that have recently been on the rise.
It coincided with an expedition training, so <cf>they were both dealing with them at the same time.
They wouldn't let him near the village, but <cf>they couldn't let him destroy it all.
I wanted to take care of the rest, but <cf>just couldn't cover it all by myself.
I'm sorry. I need a little help from you.
Can you take down 10 each of the Swan Plizzard and <cf>Ignis Lizard in [Shiotai]chi[/Shiotai] and [Hama]?
I'm going to go destroy their nest while I'm at it. <cf>I'll take care of that. Sorry, but I'm counting on you!
If we pull the guards out at this point, <cf>we might damage Jubilia.
I have to clean up after my men. <cf>Sorry, but I need your help too.
Swanblizzard and Ignis Lizard, <cf>I need you to take down 10 each.
I'll just use the ones who show up at the "Shiotaichi Beach". <cf>In the meantime, I'm going to go destroy the nest!
Ta, thank God you're here. ...... <cf>You're here, Captain~......
Oh, even the supplies are ....... <cf>I knew the captain was the best... ......
too, I can't move anymore: ......
Hungry, hungry ......
Oh, you, thank you! <cf>You kicked the Lizard's ass.
I smashed the nest, too. <cf>You made it easy for us.
Jubilia can rest easy now. <cf>I told everyone it was your achievement!
Now, let's take our men back home. <cf>I'll even feed you on the liner.
For once, I'm looking at them in a new light. <cf>These guys are pretty good, aren't they?
It's still worth working out and <cf>that the more you do it, the stronger you get!
Alright!　I'll exempt you from swimming home, but <cf>there are all sorts of workouts you can do on the boat!
Sleep well today, boys! <cf>I'll get back into it tomorrow, too!
Oh, it's you! <cf>You've been a big help to me in Jubilia.
The expeditionary training was a good experience. <cf>My men are getting their guts back in gear.
It's time to throw them out into the desert. <cf>If the beach is okay, we can make it!
Suspicious. I doubt it, those two. <cf>Very suspicious.
You guys fight all the time when you see each other, but <cf>you still see each other every time you have to run an errand.
If you really don't like them, you wouldn't have met them in the first place. <cf>So, does that mean ...... by any chance?
The captain asked me to get some materials for him.
Overweight steel plate"? <cf>It's not something you can get quickly.
Maybe we should talk to the Order of Bapharia. <cf>The Order and the Order have a cooperative relationship.
I hope there's some left over over there: ......
A senior priest asked me to procure materials from <cf>
I'm looking for "overweight steel plate" <cf>It's not something you can get right away.
We have no choice. Shall I consult with the Order of the Knights? <cf>There are many cases in which we can accommodate each other's supplies.
I hope there are some extras over there: ......
Hello, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>If you are free, could you do me a favor?
I'm talking about our Captain Vilmer and <cf>Bapharia Priestess Anelma.
They are suspicious, these two. <cf>Very suspicious indeed.
You guys fight all the time when you see each other, but <cf>it seems like you're both aware of each other!
I'd like to find out what's really going on. <cf>Can you help me out a little bit?
Thank you very much. <cf>Maybe we'll have some adventurers on board.
Atashi is a good friend of Captain Vilmer as well as <cf>Anelma!
They're both so hard-headed or <cf>that they don't know how to give in to the other.
Every time we meet, we get into a fight, so <cf>I'm in between every time!
But, but. You know how they say the more you fight, the better <cf>you get along?
Captain Vilmer, who is so twitchy, is also ...... in his heart. <cf>Even the super cool and cold Mr. Anelma is ...... in his heart!
If that were the case, it would definitely be interesting!
I was thinking about it, and then two people called me <cf>each!
Just in time, I thought I'd take advantage of the errands to explore <cf>
For now, let's start with Captain Villmer.
I'm sure he's making the rounds of Bernhardt Castle, so I'm sure you can find him somewhere at <cf>
You're going to have to run a lot of errands anyway. <cf>Let's get the unpleasant ones out of the way first!
Captain Vilmer and Anelma, <cf>They are absolutely suspicious!
I've just been called by two people and <cf>I'll explore it while I'm on my errands.
We'll start with Captain Vilmer. <cf>He should be inside Bernhardt Castle.
Oh, you're here at last, Scherni. <cf>What, you're with us, Mr. Adventurer?
Thank you for your help the other day, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>My men will give you trouble anyway, but please take care of them.
No, no, no, the way you say it. You can lift your men up a little more <cf>, Mr. Captain.
So, Scherni. <cf>I have a quick favor to ask you.
I don't like it.
I need you to get me an 'overweight steel plate'. <cf>You can carry it to the castle.
If you defeat [PM (proto-machina)] Dogorman beta type, you should be able to get <cf>
I just don't know where they are. <cf>Sorry, but I'm asking you to start looking.
No, you're not listening to me at all! <cf>Why are you assuming that I'm going to take it on?
And what's an "overweight steel plate"? <cf>That thing is so heavy!
That's why you're here. <cf>You're the only one available in the unit right now.
You're pretty handy for a guy like you, <cf>, asking for help from the adventurers in advance.
I knew you pushed me into trouble~. <cf>I've been invited by Anelma after this.
<span size="Big">A-ne-ru-ma-da~? &lt;/&gt;
Oh, no. I gave out my name.
Hey, come on, Scherni! <cf>I hope that woman didn't give you any ideas!
He has nothing to do with this time! <cf>Don't say anything you don't have to!
Now go gather the "overweight steel plates"! <cf>This is a captain's order, you understand!
Okay, okay, I understand! <cf>It's "overweight steel plate," yes, yes, yes!
Hah, geez. Just hearing Anelma's name <cf>is enough to set that tone.
I've taken on the "overweight steel plate" thing too. <cf>It is arrogant, as usual. Captain, you are arrogant!
It can't be helped. <cf>Let's go and ask Anelma about her errands too.
You mentioned you were at the castle, so I'm sure <cf>you're nearby.
I'll collect the "overweight steel plates" that the captain asked for at <cf>later.
Let's go and ask Anelma what she wants. <cf>She says she's at the castle, so I'm sure we'll find her soon.
Thank you for your visit. <cf>Mr. Scherni, and Mr. Adventurer, too.
Hello, Anelma. <cf>I've been invited to join you.
I've been forced by the captain to do something troublesome, and <cf>I'll take care of Anelma's errands in a jiffy~!
Mr. Villmer? <cf>Hasn't he started making unreasonable demands again?
That person has a <cf>high pressure attitude towards Mr. Scherni on a regular basis. He should change it.
If Mr. Scherni has difficulty in refusing, <cf>I will be happy to offer my assistance.
Wow, only <cf>Anelma would side with me like that~!　You are so sweet~!
...... I'm starting to feel like <cf>is too good to be true for the captain.
I am sorry to hear about this situation, but <cf>would you please do me a favor?
I'd like you to collect the material "overweight steel plate" at <cf>
Huh?　Are you also an "overweight steel plate", Anelma?
Yes, we were told that there were people in need. <cf>We found no surplus in the Order.
I found out that you can find <cf>in the "Miasma Abandoned Mines and Free Exploration" in "Stahl Coast".
I wasn't that clear on what kind of monsters to take down <cf>
Maybe it's [PM (proto-machina)] Dogorman beta type. <cf>Since I was told such a story
I see. Well then, could you please <cf>"Overweight Steel Plate"?
Please deliver about five of them to the castle. <cf>I will also rely on the merchant's [connections]. Good bye.
Hmmm...to have two people ask for the same thing. <cf>Such a coincidence, isn't it?
But with the <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Dogorman beta type in "Abandoned Mines of Miasma, Free Exploration", it's a nasty opponent!
I'm glad I hired an adventurer, or so I thought. <cf>Excuse me, but please stay with me.
Defeat <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Dogorman Beta type in the "Miasma Abandoned Mine, Free Search" in "Stahl Coast" and obtain 5 "Overweight Steel Plates".
When you're done, come back to Bernhardt Castle. <cf>Then we'll call it the start of the mission!
Defeat <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Dogorman Beta type in the "Miasma Abandoned Mine, Free Search" in "Stahl Coast" and obtain 5 "Overweight Steel Plates".
Once completed, return to Bernhardt Castle.
Sorry to put you through all this, but <cf>would be great to have you on board!
Haha, haha ...... bo, adventurer ....... <cf>Thank you for collecting "overweight steel plates." ......
Oh, I can't do it anymore!　Such a ridiculously heavy thing, <cf>Why do I have to carry it by hand~?
Excuse me!　I'm here from the military research institute <cf>to check on the "overweight steel plate"!
The institute?　Hey, could it be the Institute people who were looking for "overweight steel plates" at <cf>?
Yes, I have a spare. I needed it suddenly, and there were no spares left at the <cf>lab.
I had asked the Knights of Bernhardt and the Order of Bapharia to procure <cf>each.
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 with ....... <cf>That's exactly 5 cards. Confirmed.
We will come back to collect them later. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation!
I see - that's how it works! <cf>So the request went to both the Order and the Order.
So, both Captain Vilmer and Mr. Anelma <cf>wanted to prepare "overweight steel plates" for each other.
Oh, Scherni. And you, adventurer. <cf>I'm glad you're here.
Thank you. <cf>Thanks to you and Mr. Scherni and your adventurers for all your hard work.
I mean, you!　Anelma! <cf>What are you doing here!
Why are you here, Mr. Villmer?
Both the captain and Anelma said they both wanted <cf>"overweight steel plates"!
So, I got the adventurers to help me get it together. <cf>The people from the institute came to check it out just now.
I have a point of concern about <cf>!
Neither you nor Anelma were asked directly by the institute <cf>, were you?
I think I just overheard you talking about it. <cf>Why did you bother to ask Atta?
I heard this guy was in trouble.
I heard that Mr. Villmer was in trouble.
Heh~?　Oh~?　Hmmm~! <cf>It's a strange coincidence, isn't it?
I heard that you both wanted <cf>to have each other!
And without telling the other party!
I think we can call this a gift now, don't you? <cf>Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what's with the scowl? <cf>It's just a procurement mission, nothing more!
Anelma in the first place!　Why did you ask Scherni to do this? <cf>You could have just told me to get the materials!
I can't help but ask Mr. Vilmer for what you are looking for at <cf>Vilmer
We will deliver the "Overweight Steel Plate" to you. <cf>Mr. Vilmer can take it.
I don't want it!　You needed it, so <cf>you take it!
I was told that Mr. Vilmer was looking for it. <cf>I would not be happy to have it for you.
<span size="Big">What...what...oh? &lt;/&gt;
Here we go again. <cf>Really, I never get tired of fighting with you no matter how many times we fight.
Thank you very much, adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry I asked for so much.
As for me, I am very satisfied! <cf>I now have more material to make fun of the captain.
Now, let's see how I can get the two of you involved next time. <cf>You're not being honest at all~ grin.
I think the captain and Anelma <cf>would be a good match for each other.
You both care about each other. <cf>You're not being honest, and you're just like each other.
How am I going to make it stick? <cf>This isn't about the mission anymore!　grin
Um, you know! <cf>Could you show me the way?
I want to go to Jubilia, across the sea. <cf>So I decided to go for the ocean first.
If there's lots of water, it's the ocean, right?
It's okay, the ocean is big! <cf>There's no way we could get lost.
Thank you!　I won't get lost this time!
The sea is the sea, but there is no port or landing place <cf>I ran towards the cliff ......
You, do you have any idea what it's like to be a lost adventurer named Pissarri <cf>?
If you know where he is, I'd appreciate a little help. <cf>As usual, I don't know where he went.
She's done a lot for me, <cf>so if she's in trouble, I'd like to help her out.
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>Hmm?　You know Pissary.
Did you get lost a few times? <cf>Hahaha, you're still the same!
Pissary is a good adventurer, you know. <cf>A lot of guys have been saved by that kid.
When someone's in trouble, they'll wander in from somewhere and <cf>help people out.
I'm usually in the middle of a lost child.
I've had to give directions and help out a few times too. <cf>I was just about to return the favor one of these days.
Rumor on the wind is that Pissary is hanging around here and there <cf>for something he wants to do.
Sorry to meddle from my end, but <cf>you, can't you help that kid out?
You're welcome. Just finding Pissary is going to be <cf>a pretty big deal. ......
A farmer in Minsterhorn was taken care of by <cf>Pissary the other day.
Listen to the story and retrace your steps. <cf>Thanks for helping Pissary as it is.
I'm asking you. Because I'll be praying to you and Pissary <cf>for God's blessings on Bapharia.
A farmer in Minsterhorn might know where <cf>Pissary is.
Listen to what they have to say and retrace their steps.
If you find Pissary, please help him. <cf>He's got something he wants to do.
I'm asking for it. May the gods of Bapharia bless <cf>you all.
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you in our fields?
Oh, you mean Mr. Pissary? <cf>Yes, you helped me the other day.
My son is a budding adventurer. <cf>He slipped while exploring Dragon Claw Valley.
He was surrounded by vicious monsters when <cf>Mr. Pissary walked by.
So, he kicked the monster out of the way in no time and saved my <cf>son!
It was in the bushes where people would never come. <cf>My son was amazed!
I wanted to thank you, but <cf>["]I have something I want to do[,]"] and left early.
I don't know where you're going. ...... <cf>I don't even know if you are where you are headed.
Oh, yes. I left a thank-you gift for Mr. Pissary at <cf>at the Asterleeds settlement office.
You may have already received it. <cf>You might want to ask the Pioneer Bureau.
I have deposited a thank you to <cf>Pissary at the Asterleeds pioneer station.
Maybe you have received it. <cf>If not, you may still hear from us.
I'm sure if you ask the Pioneer Bureau, <cf>you'll be able to track down Mr. Pissarri.
Thanks for your hard work, adventurers. <cf>Thank you for your continued support of our pioneering bureau!
Do you have a question? <cf>Yes, what is it? I'll take care of it.
Is this the footsteps of ...... Pissary? <cf>Hmmm, I haven't seen you around lately.
I have a stack of thank you letters and rewards that I haven't received, and I'd like to <cf>see you face to face as well.
Mr. Pissary has a tendency to not sit still <cf>when someone is in trouble!
I can fight, gather, craft, survive, <cf>anything, and solve any problems!
Many people were helped, and the Pioneer Bureau even tried to commend <cf>Pissary!
I got lost and couldn't make it to <cf>for the awards ceremony.
Let's see, Pissary's recent disappearance is at ......
Oh, you received a thank-you from a merchant in Kanaloa. <cf>Mr. Pissary gave me some precious medicinal herbs.
If you ask the merchant, you may be able to track down Mr. Pissary at <cf>
Huh?　You saved the newcomer in Dragon Claw Valley, <cf>and delivered the herb to Kanaloa right after that, ......?
What kind of route would <cf>be able to travel in such a short period of time? ......
I recently met Mr. Pissarri at <cf>He seems to be a merchant in Kanaloa!
If you talk to us, <cf>I think you'll be able to find your footing, Mr. Pissarri.
I thought it would be best to follow up on this as soon as possible if possible.
Once Mr. Pissary is gone, even a search party from the <cf>Pioneer Bureau can't find him, so ......
Hey, welcome to the site. We're happy to have you as an adventurer at <cf>and we'll be happy to give you some extra help!
You helped me just the other day. <cf>Your name is Mr. Pissary.
Huh?　Are you looking for Mr. Pissary? <cf>Oh, that's just great!
I also wanted to thank you for your help. <cf>Please find him!
The other day, I was running low on medicinal herbs and <cf>Pissary walked by.
He left us a lot of <cf>because he happened to have them with him!
It can only be found on cliffs far from human habitation <cf>It's so precious, and it really saved my life!
...... Indeed, how did you collect such medicinal herbs <cf>in such large quantities?
Anyway, I went to <cf>["]I've got some things I want to do["]"] without even thanking you.
I don't know exactly where they are, but <cf>that herb can be found near the desert.
Mr. Pissary may be based in Salamzart and is active at <cf>
It's a popular gathering place and you can find it at <cf>Salamzart
Mr. Pissary may be based in Salamzart at <cf>
I'm sure there are a lot of people there who have seen you or helped you <cf>
Salamzart is a long way from here. <cf>There, well, it's Mr. Pissary. ......
Um!　Um!　Can you tell me the way?
I want to go to Jubilia, but I'm lost! <cf>I thought I was going for the ocean, but I can't find it anywhere!
...... What?　Accepted a request to help me? <cf>Were you worried about Mr. Panayote and everyone else getting lost?
Ta, I'm sure I'm lost, but ...... <cf>I just thought it would be okay this time!
Jubilia is across the ocean, right? <cf>So why don't we just go to the ocean?
You wouldn't think of aiming for the ocean and getting lost!
I'm actually lost, so yes, ....... <cf>Not very convincing, yes. ......
Well, then, let me reiterate! <cf>Can you tell me how to get to Jubilia?
Oh, I'm sorry!　You taught me very clearly <cf>but I still didn't understand!
sniff. You know, in Jubilia, <cf>I'd like to send flowers to someone who's helped me a lot.
I know I'm silly, but can you take me to Jubilia <cf>?　Please.
I just want to go to Jubilia, but <cf>I feel like I'm going a very long way ......
I'm sorry. Please take me to Jubilia <cf>silly me ......
If I walk alone any longer, I'm afraid I'm going to put everyone <cf>from worry to annoyance ......
Tsk, I'm here!　Jubilier!
Wow, thank you!　Thank you so much! <cf>It was far away~!
You just got yourself lost and far away, yes. ......
But now I'm finally going to get what I came for.
I'd like to offer flowers to someone. <cf>I want to go to Ia Mole.
But I heard some bad news. <cf>Gilmy Warlord is tearing up that area.
I have my purposes, but the people in the village are in trouble, and <cf>I can't just leave them alone!
I'm sorry to drag you into this! <cf>But I need your help too.
Let's divide and conquer the Gilmy Warlord of "Ia Mole [Reef]" by <cf>hand!
No, it's okay!　I'll be here where you can see me! <cf>I won't go anywhere without your permission!
Six Gilmy Warlords each! <cf>You and I will have an easy time. Come on, let's go!
I need to go to "Ia Mole [Reef]" <cf>I think Gilmy Warlord is trolling!
It is dangerous for the villagers and we will drive them away!
Don't worry!　I won't go away without permission! <cf>I can take them down!
I see you've finished defeating the Gilmey Warlords! <cf>Thanks a lot!
I offered flowers too. <cf>I was glad the sea was so beautiful and calm.
The man is a senior adventurer whom I respect. <cf>When I was a little kid, he helped me when I was lost.
I'm not a person who's extremely strong, or like Jake, <cf>at the top of his game, or anything like that.
He said he did whatever he could <cf>to help those in need.
I worked so hard <cf>to become an adventurer like him!
But he died before I could catch up.
There were not many adventurers in Jubilia during the pioneering period, and <cf>they were reckless to protect everyone from the monsters!
It's like that guy, though. <cf>He could have waited a little longer.
But it felt good to be able to give him flowers. <cf>I thought again, "I knew I was going for that guy.
What?　The Pioneer Station is full of thank-yous addressed to me? <cf>And you know who else is thanking me?
Phew, I'm glad to hear that! <cf>I'm embarrassed, but I'm doing my best in my own way.
All right, I'll keep on being an adventurer, I'll keep on trying! <cf>Even a lost child can do it!
Let's do it!　Oooh!
I can't help but get nervous when I get an order from the Bapharia Order <cf>
If I delivered a bad one, it would be like blaspheming <cf>
I get scolded even when I don't mean to. <cf>Mistakes are strictly forbidden in the Order of the Faithful.
I delivered a sword to <cf>ordered by a guard of the Order of Bapharia.
It seems to be a ceremonial sword. <cf>It's a beautifully decorated fine sword.
However, this sword was mistaken for <cf>another sword and ......
Hey, peddler! <cf>What's going on with the sword I ordered?
You didn't really think you were going to trick <cf>me by selling me something cheap, did you?
If you don't make it to the ceremony in time, <cf>you're going to be a disgrace to the face of the God of Bapharia!
It's not a disaster! <cf>It was just a small mistake!
The sword you ordered will be delivered immediately! <cf>Please wait just a little longer.
You really only have a limited amount of time to wait. <cf>God sees everything.
You can't lie and cheat! <cf>If you don't make it in time, be prepared!
It's been this way for a long time. It's a ceremonial sword, <cf>and the cultists are tense.
We need to recover the "Sword of Ritual" as soon as possible!
The other sword, the one I got wrong, was ordered by an adventurer. <cf>I'm going to go see that person now.
But the adventurer said he was headed to <cf>"Abandoned Galley Ridge Road".
It's not safe in that area, is it? <cf>I can't move if I'm on my own.
That's why I need you to escort me. <cf>I need your help until I retrieve the sword.
I'll do the negotiating, please.
I gave the wrong "ceremonial armored sword" to the <cf>adventurer. I'll retrieve it right away.
You said you were headed to the "Abandoned Galley Ridge Road" so <cf>I'm going to need an escort.
I need your help until I finish retrieving the sword. <cf>Please do.
Oh, we're in the same business, aren't we? <cf>Are you exploring around here, too?
Huh?　That merchant over there <cf>looks familiar to me.
Thank God, I found you! <cf>I was looking for you!
I sold you a "ceremonial sword", didn't I? <cf>I mistook it for the real thing.
Oh, I see! <cf>I thought it was a very nice sword for the price.
Maybe you're here to collect?
Yes, it is. We're using it for a Bapharia ceremony, so we had to get it to <cf>right away.
Ohcha. ....... Sorry about that. <cf>I don't think I'll ever be able to return that sword.
Have you ever heard of the Hidden Mines of Tomdrum? <cf>It's said to be where the bandits' hidden treasure lies.
I came here for that treasure too. <cf>I screwed up when I went down there for a preview.
Accepted Flame Lapidus by surprise, <cf>I dropped my sword on him.
Oh, no!　So the "Sword of Ritual" is on <cf>Flame Lapidus turf?
That's what I mean. <cf>I'm not good enough to run away.
I lost my weapon and I was just about to <cf>start over.
However, it's a Bapharia ritual-related thing, isn't it? <cf>I'd be pissed too if I wasn't so good at it.
Hey, you. Can you get me back my "ceremonial sword" <cf>?
I'd rather have you go than me, unarmed, for sure. <cf>And from the looks of it, you're a lot stronger than I am.
I'm asking you to do the same!　 <cf>The Order will not wait any longer!
You are my only hope! <cf>I want my 'ceremonial sword' back!
Done. Flame Lapis should be found at <cf>"Tomdrum's Hidden Mine, Investigation"
If you go deep enough, you can retrieve <cf>the "Sword of Ritual".
I'll escort this merchant to Larpal. <cf>Take care of the sword!
It looks like if you go to "Tomdrum's Hidden Mine, Investigation" <cf>you'll find Flame Lapis.
I want my 'ceremonial sword' back!
I'll head back to Larpal first. <cf>You can come as soon as you can!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>You retrieved the "Sword of Ritual" for me.
Yeah, it's definitely this sword. <cf>Now we can finally deliver.
Oh, that's a great sword! <cf>It was worth ordering.
We apologize for any concern this may have caused. <cf>Please, please pay it forward.
Mm, indeed. <cf>The gods of Bapharia will be pleased.
Thanks to the adventurers over there for their hard work. <cf>Now, I have some ritual preparations to do, so I'll leave you with this.
Haha - thank goodness. <cf>I don't know what I would have done without you.
The people of the Order could do with a little work, too. <cf>Let me thank you again from my end.
You're the only reason I got through <cf>without being disrespectful to the Bapharia gods.
I know there are many ways to think about it. <cf>I still honor God.
Besides, it's an honor for a <cf>merchant to be inquired by the Order.
Thank you so much. <cf>I'll be careful next time.
It's an honor for a <cf>merchant to be inquired by the Bapharia Order.
I know I have a lot to take care of, but <cf>I'm still glad to be of service to God!
Luggage is scattered about.
It bears the seal of the Merchant's Association of Larpal and the Pioneer Bureau. <cf> I wonder if it was ever transported to the interior of the [Outer Continent].
In addition, the wrapping is torn quite messily: ......
You might want to report it just in case. <cf>I'll collect the packing tags.
Ah!　Adventurer, that luggage tag! <cf>May I see them?
The Merchants Association of Larpal and the Pioneer Bureau ....... <cf>You have the markings of both. Where did you get this?
[In the "Moon Valley" of the "Outer Continent"? <cf>How in the world did you end up in such a place? ......
Um, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you do me a favor?
This package was prepared jointly by the merchants of Larpal and <cf>the Bureau of Reclamation!
The contents are "Hoshikai silver", <cf>a special silver used in the rituals of the Order of Bapharia.
Each grain resonates with the stars in the heavens. <cf>It is a rare ore with such a legend.
It was robbed during transport.
According to the victimized merchant, <cf>the perpetrators were a very powerful armed group!
They are very well organized for bandits <cf>, yet their tactics are extremely aggressive.
And, oddly enough, he didn't even look at <cf>any of the gold items other than "Hoshikai Gin"!
The Pioneer Bureau was also following his footsteps. <cf>I didn't think he had been transported to the [outer continent (Gaitai continent)]. ......
Anyway, we need to get back "Hoshikai Gin". <cf>Please lend me your help, adventurers!
Let's head to Jubilia first. <cf>We will gather information there and set a course of action.
The stolen cargo is "Hoshikai Gin". <cf>It was robbed by a group of vicious armed men.
I don't know why it was transported to the [outer continent], but <cf>we need to get it back anyway!
Let's head to Jubilia first. <cf>I will head there as well. I look forward to working with you.
Thanks for your help, adventurer. <cf>I asked the locals about the whereabouts of "Star Sea Silver".
It was a reasonably large package, and <cf>there were some witnesses.
Conversely, you carried stolen goods with impunity <cf>without worrying about being seen. ......
The destination of the armed group seems to be a place called <cf>"Kahuna [cave]".
The place where the adventurer found the package was also near <cf>wasn't it? I'm pretty sure it was.
However, since then, no such group has been seen in the vicinity of the "Kahuna [cave]" <cf>
Have they already disappeared? ......
Adventurers, can you please conduct "Kahuna [cave], additional investigation" and retrieve <cf>"Star Sea Silver"?
Sorry, I can't help you in the battle. <cf>Besides, I'm a little concerned about something.
The Kahuna Cave is one of the sacred sites in the <cf>[sea god] cult that remains in the area.
And "Star Sea Silver" is a special metal used for <cf>rituals in the Bapharia religion
It is said that once, a Bapharia priest tried to hear the voice of God in the <cf>heavens through the "Star Sea Silver"!
It's only a legend, but it's also true that it's still passed down as a cult ritual <cf>
Is there any connection to the armed group ....... <cf>I can only guess, but I'll look into it.
Please do some additional research on the "Kahuna [cave]. <cf>If there is any danger, please do not take any chances.
If we can get the "Star Sea Silver" back, that's all we need.
The armed group that robbed "Star Sea Silver" seems to be heading to <cf>"Kahuna's Cave".
I think we can get back <cf>"Star Sea Silver" if we do "Kahuna's [cave] and additional research".
The armed group has not been seen since and may have already fled <cf>
Adventurers, please take it easy. <cf>If you judge it to be dangerous, please pull up.
Welcome back, adventurers! <cf>Thank you for your hard work in surveying the "Kahuna Cave"!
Ah, this is "Hoshikai Gin". <cf>No doubt it's the one that was stolen.
Good. <cf>Did you find any other clues?
I don't know the details of the situation and can send it to ....... <cf>Understood, thank you.
Let's not pursue this any further. <cf>I will raise a detailed report with the Pioneer Bureau.
Who or what was the purpose? <cf>I can't shake the creepy feeling. ......
I too have learned a lot from the people of the village <cf>
The kahuna of "Kahuna Cave" is said to be a kind of priest or priestess in the <cf>[sea god] faith.
And, there is an even more important sacred place, the "Sea God's Cavern," located behind the "Cave of Kahuna," <cf>
The kahuna made offerings to the place from time immemorial, <cf>and sometimes brought the voice of the [sea god] to the people!
It's similar to the lore in "Seikai Gin."
The criminals tried to use "Hoshikai Gin" in the holy land to <cf>hear someone's voice, or something like that?
Sorry. <cf>I'm afraid I'm not imagining things when I talk about it here.
The "Star Sea Silver" has been successfully recovered and the <cf>case is now closed for now!
Thank you so much. <cf>I owe everything to the adventurers.
We look forward to your continued support of the Pioneer Bureau and the citizens of <cf>!
Jubilia and Asterleeds can come and go by <cf>liner, so that's a big help.
This is a bustling town, <cf>unlike the life of the forest people.
I may not be used to living here, but I love visiting <cf>
Well, I guess my kind of thinking would be an oddity even for <cf>forest folk.
Hi, I'm Caponono. <cf>I'm a forest dweller living in Jubilia.
I come to Asterleeds sometimes via liner <cf>
I came here today to try my hand at fishing.
I befriended an adventurer who came to Jubilia before, <cf>and he gave me a legacy from Bapharia.
I heard that everything is useful for catching fish. <cf>But then again, I've never fished before.
What do you think?　I wonder if you, the adventurous one, might have any idea what <cf>is all about?
Hmmm, doesn't ring a bell? <cf>I'd appreciate it if someone here knows more about this.
Oh, it's rare to meet a fisherman from the forest folk. <cf>Good meeting!
My name is Andor. I'm trying to promote fishing. <cf>If you have any questions, I'm here to help.
I appreciate that. <cf>Actually, a friend of mine gave me this Bapharia legacy.
I've heard it helps with fishing, but I'm not sure how to use <cf>
Hmmm, may I take a look? <cf>Which one? ......
Apparently it's some kind of lure. <cf>A pseudo-bait, if you will.
Oh, you mean the fake bait that is made to look like bait. <cf>I hear that expert anglers use them to fool fish.
Yes!　And this legacy seems to move <cf>lures by itself!
Perhaps just throwing it into the ocean will make it <cf>move as good as the real thing!
Hoho. So I guess you can catch fish without using <cf>bait.
Yes, but it has been used a lot. <cf>It is better to repair it.
I think "Decorative Feathers of the Thunderbird" would make a <cf>good finish!
The "Thunderbird Feathers" is a material for the Lightning Pecker. <cf>You can find them in the valley of Tsukikakushi.
Sorry to take up so much of your time, but could you please go to <cf>and collect about four
I got it from a human friend. <cf>I want to use it in a proper way.
It seems that to repair Bapharia's heritage, <cf>"Thunderbird's Ornamental Feathers" are needed.
You can get it from <cf>Lightning Pecker in "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku".
Sorry to take up your time, but could you please collect about <cf>four of them. Thanks in advance.
Hey, thanks. <cf>I see you've collected the "Thunderbird's Decorative Feathers."
Lightning pecker is on land but <cf>wings help with fishing? Strange.
Hey, welcome back! <cf>Looks like you got all your materials in one piece.
Well then, let's repair Mr. Caponono's legacy. <cf>Leave it to me!
Okay, that's good! <cf>And while we're at it, I've got a rod for you.
I hope you enjoy fishing with it! <cf>Your friends will be happy to see you!
Thanks for everything. <cf>It was nice to meet someone so kind.
Some forest folk don't like the company of humans <cf>
I'm a friend, and you guys <cf>seem to have had a good meeting!
While I'm hanging my fishing line, <cf>I'll think of all the people I've met!
If you see the forest people, please walk up to them. <cf>They're just not used to people being nice to them.
Fishing is a very deep game. <cf>And you get to meet a lot of people.
I've made a number of fishermen friends. <cf>Humans and forest people alike.
Yeah, I'm glad I started. <cf>Maybe you should try fishing once in a while too.
Right, okay!　Left OK! <cf>No abnormalities today, safety check complete!
Mm, [blend in]. [I'll get used to it, I'll get used to it! <cf>I have crossed the sea, I have been reborn once again!
Now, shout to that sea! <cf>I am the One Man Army!
We meet again across the sea, my rival!
After all, my fate and yours are inseparable. <cf>Even if we are separated by a great sea!
Then, you have no choice but to sign up. <cf>That's right!　Let's play again in the new place!
Before I, aka the one-man army, <cf>let me show you what you can do!
Oops, not so fast. <cf>I'll tell you what I'm in no hurry to tell you.
That's why I call myself a one-man army!
But I will not reveal it easily! <cf>You know that, don't you?
The game is in "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku" (The Valley of the Hidden Moon)! <cf>Defeat the monsters there!
Gilmy Shaman and Gilmy Sage. <cf>You can try to defeat them all together!
I beat them 14 at a time! <cf> If you can't beat 15 of them, it's impossible to surpass me!
Huh, dealing with two kinds at once. <cf>A one-man army indeed!　I'm afraid of myself, man.
Let's get started!　The strong sit and wait! <cf>We await the outcome of your fight!
The game will be played by defeating the monsters in "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku"! <cf>Targets are the Gilmy Shaman and the Gilmy Sage!
Can you take them down 15 at a time? <cf>If you can beat them, you win!
Phew, taking on both at the same time. <cf>It's exactly what a one-man army looks like!
<span size="Big">What, what, what, what? &lt;/&gt;
You've already defeated Guillemie and the others? <cf>That's ridiculous, it's too soon!
Hold on a sec!　I'll go check it out!
Geez ...... geez ....... It really had been taken down. <cf>Sorry, my bad for doubting you.
That's what I'm talking about!　Gilmy Shaman and Sage, <cf>I can't believe you took down 15 of them collectively!
You are truly a one-man army! <cf>A warrior in solitude who can fight alone!
I'm all alone, too. <cf>I proudly bore this name.
One that can fight like an army with only one man! <cf>A one-man army!　That's me!
If I had been a one-man army back then, <cf>that puppy that was hungry and whimpering would have been ......
No, it's nothing! <cf>One Man Army is a symbol of loneliness!　No regrets!
But we don't need two one-man armies. <cf>After all, he is a one-man army.
If there were two of us, the sign would be false. <cf>I will gladly give up my one-man army position to you!
I was out of my league. <cf>Your loneliness seems to be of a different standard!
That's what I'm talking about!　You can fight through it all alone <cf>You should be proud of yourself!
Well then, farewell!　Next time I will not be defeated! <cf>Strive in solitude and isolation, my rivals!
The environment you changed in [the outer continent] is <cf>a good workout.
Let's change things up a bit. <cf>Let's go deep into the continent!
The people of the forest have many legends. <cf>Some of them are actually useful!
Whenever we run out of ore or other materials, we are told to go to <cf>["][Seishoka]"].
I'm a regular customer sometimes, too. <cf>Maybe I can help you on your journey.
Yo!　Welcome! <cf>You're the adventurer, right?
Thanks for taking care of the request! <cf>[I heard the guys in the township are busy with other things, so I'm glad I could help.
The monsters in the forest have been going wild lately. <cf>My orders for weapons have skyrocketed.
Thanks to this, I've been holed up in the workshop from morning to night. <cf>I haven't had time to go to the woods, I've been so busy.
Then, we'll run out of materials.
And that's where you come in. <cf>Why don't you go to the "Silent Forest" to collect ore?
What I want is "doulos ore. <cf>We can get by with five of them for the time being.
As I said before, the forest is noisy now. <cf>Monsters are running amok, so watch your back, okay?
If you want, I can lend you some of my weapons. <cf>...... No, you don't need one.
You are using a good weapon. <cf>A weapon that fits in your hand is the best!　I'm sorry for meddling.
Well, I'm counting on you. Adventurers! <cf>I want you to get me five "Douro Ores" in a jiffy!
Douro Ore" can be found in the "[Silence] Forest". <cf>It's enough to get about five of them.
Be careful of the monsters. <cf>I'll be waiting for you!
Oh, you're back, adventurer! <cf>Looks like you found the Douro Ore, too.
Let's see... ...... Oh, nice stones! <cf>I've got a few of them, and they'll last me a while.
No, it was really helpful. Thanks!
The people of the forest don't use Bapharia's heritage. <cf>Weapons are made using traditional blacksmithing methods.
It's vital that you're working the wood and metal by hand to even out the <cf>engrams.
This is where we show our skill and craftsmanship. <cf>The weapons we make are highly accurate, man.
I'm as good as any of your weapons.
Oops, my bad!　I don't care about bragging. <cf>I just remembered something else.
The people of the forest have many legends. <cf>One of them may be of use to you.
When you're short on rocks and materials like this one, <cf>can make it a little easier to find.
[It's a legend that says, "[Appeal to the blue crystal flower]". <cf>I'd like to share this with you.
There is a blue crystal flower in the Silent Forest. <cf>Will you accompany me there?
It should help you on your journey. <cf>Let me pass along the ore as a thank you.
There is a legend among the people of the forest that you should pray to the blue crystal flower. <cf>It's a useful thing to do when you're short of materials.
It should help adventurers on their journey. <cf>Since we're here, let me share it with you.
There is a blue crystal flower in the Forest of Silence. <cf>Can you accompany me there?
Oh!　This is it. <cf>It's the "Seishoka" of the legend.
The legend says that if you don't have the materials, you should ask for them here. <cf>I'll make a request right away.
First, you find the "Seishoka" (blue crystal flower). <cf>And then you make a certain move in front of it.
'Sprinkling engrams' is what I'm wishing for the <cf>woods, man!
If you do, the forest will bring you bounty. <cf>If you do it, you'll see it at a glance.
I'm there for you when I run out of ore too. <cf>You can try it too if you're having trouble.
Sprinkle the engrams and wish for ["][blue crystal flower (seishoka)]"["]. <cf>Remember.
However, it is only a help. <cf>It does not mean that we can do it without limit, so please be careful.
See ya!　When you get a chance <cf>let me work on your weapons too!
How's your request to "Seishoka"? <cf>Does it help?
If you follow the proper procedures, <cf>the forest should help you.
Sprinkle the engrams and wish for ["][blue crystal flower (seishoka)]"["]. <cf>Remember!
When the ancestors of the forest people die, they return to the <cf>forest to watch over us.
The trees in the forest are like our ancestors. <cf>We have to take care of them and respect them.
I, for one, thank my <cf>ancestors every day as I head into the woods!
Dear ancestors! <cf>I am fine today, thank you!
Adventurers from outside the forest! <cf>Defeat the Soiree Tyrant Boa!
I'm running amok in the Silent Forest! <cf>I hit and scratched the trees in the forest!
Our ancestors are sleeping in the forest! <cf>I can't forgive them for bothering us as much as they want!
Haha, haha ....... <cf>I'm sorry. I'm so distraught. ......
You know, there is a monster called <cf>Soiree Tyrant Boa in the [Silent Forest].
He's out on his nightly rampage, <cf>damaging the trees in our precious forests.
Our ancestors are sleeping in the forest. <cf>This is not a good place for them to rest!
Destroying the forest is the same as disrespecting our ancestors. <cf>I absolutely cannot allow it!
But the adults were too busy to <cf>take me up on it. ......
So, adventurers, please get rid of those guys! <cf>Please!
Soiree Tyrant Boas are in the Forest of Silence. <cf>They only come out at night, so be careful.
I'm sure your ancestors will be on your side! <cf>Please, adventurer!
They're drinking and sleeping in the daytime. <cf>You disturb the sleep of your ancestors!
I can't allow it anymore! <cf>Please, hurry up and take those guys down!
You took down the Soiree Tyrant Boa!
Are you hurt, adventurer? <cf>Thank goodness!　Thank you so much!
Now my ancestors can have a good night's sleep. <cf>I will be able to sleep well too!
The forest is really important to us <cf>
When we, the forest people, complete our lives, we will <cf>return to the tree of life and become part of the forest.
That's why I believe there are ancestors in the forest <cf>watching over our lives.
They also take care of the trees as if they were family grave markers. <cf>Because they are our precious ancestors.
My family is the same way!　We often go to the shrine to pray.
Adventurers are welcome to come and visit if you like. <cf>I'm sure the ancestors will be happy to see you!
Let me know if you ever need help in the forest again. <cf>Thank you, kind adventurer!
I just paid a visit to my ancestors.
When I told him about your adventurer, <cf>the leaves shook a little.
I'm sure our ancestors were saying thank you <cf>!
[The guardians of the township are particularly skilled men.
Kapakuku is doing well. <cf>He's young, but dependable.
However, I can't be dependent on him alone <cf>
It's a shameful thing to ask someone from outside [the township], but ....... <cf>I need your help. I need you to listen to me.
Do you know "Dark peeking (Ooguchi)"?
This guy is a ferocious monster. <cf>He's a glutton.
When they are hungry, the animals and plants of the forest <cf>devour them at random. Not a single young sprout is left.
That's why they're walking around <cf>in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life" with a look of their own!
Actually, ...... I failed to kill him a long time ago.
It was before Pipimarka was crowned queen. <cf>I was the guardian of Ulrau Village.
That's when I came across the "dark peepers" (oguchi)," he said. <cf>Just like now, he was trolling around the forest.
He and his friends went to take them down, but missed them. <cf>And here we are.
I am old. I no longer have the strength to fight against the "dark-eyed Oguchi. <cf>It pains me to trouble the hand of the guardian of the time.
The Kapakuku guy has to do something else <cf>He'll have a lot of work to do.
So, I would like to humbly request you to do this. <cf>I hear you are a man of skill.
Sorry to impose this on you, an outsider, but <cf>I need you to take down the "Dark Peeping Mouth".
It was my fault for not finishing him off. <cf>I can't stand the idea of the forest being ruined because of it!
Ooguchi" is located in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life. <cf>However, he only appears at night.
It's not that you're petty, it's that you're a coward. ...... <cf>You can do it. I'm counting on you.
The "dark peepers [oguchi]" are located in the "Zero Zone of [meiju]". <cf>They only come out at night, so be careful.
If it weren't for this old body, <cf>I'd be there to clean up the mess in person. ......
Sorry to impose my mismanagement on you. <cf>Let me rely on your skills.
Did you do ...... by any chance? <cf>You took down the "Dark Peeping [Oguchi]," didn't you?
Oh, okay!　Thank you. <cf>I'm sure this will put everyone in [the township] at ease a little bit.
My years of regret have been cleared. <cf>I really appreciate it. I owe you.
...... I let him get away with it. <cf>It was [Miyo], the previous queen.
It was a long time ago. <cf>My predecessor's death was sudden.
Not wanting to leave the queen's throne vacant, <cf>Lady Pipimarka was enthroned in a hurry!
He was still young and not yet fully prepared. <cf>The people around him, but I think Pipimarka himself must have been the hardest to deal with.
How hard it must have been for you to fulfill your duties as Queen while enduring loneliness and sorrow <cf>......
I couldn't help the young queen. <cf>I missed the "big mouth" and added to her troubles.
If I were as good as Kapakuku, <cf>I wouldn't have bothered Master Pipimarka.
I hope this defeat will make Master Pipimarka <cf>feel a little better ......
Oops, I've talked too much. <cf>I'm sorry to have put you through the pathetic talk of an old man.
Your power is real. <cf>Please help our queen. Please.
It's been a while since I've patrolled the woods. <cf>I can still do that.
It's a small thing, but it will help <cf>[township (sato)] more than whining about it.
Anta has given me a lot of energy. <cf>It's not a bad thing to be involved with people out there.
Not surprisingly, <cf>the forest folk know a lot about medicinal herbs.
The rich forests are a treasure trove of medicinal herbs. <cf>No wonder we live in them.
But we should not pick too much. <cf>Medicinal herbs are part of the forest, too, and we should take good care of them.
A bunch of dry, parched plants have fallen. <cf>They look like they have been there for quite some time.
I wonder if it is a medicinal herb or something else. <cf>The nose-piercing aroma still lingers.
Maybe it's still available. <cf>If anyone knows anything about medicinal herbs, I'll ask.
Hi, you are the one called Adventurer. <cf>Do you have enough medicine?
I imitate a doctor. <cf>[I prepare medicinal herbs for people in my hometown.
Oh?　This scent is from ....... <cf>Do you have any kind of medicinal herbs?
Well, you found a bunch of plants in the woods. <cf>Hmmm, smells like a herbal remedy for a pick-me-up.
A herb of distraction or ....... <cf>Could you, adventurer, do me a little favor?
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>It's been a bit of a madhouse in the woods these days.
Monsters are getting temperamental and <cf>more and more of them are getting hurt.
So, I just remembered something that's been bugging me: <cf>
It is a legend passed down among the people of the forest. <cf>Long ago, in the time of our distant ancestors, ......
A mysterious monster appeared in the forest and <cf>apparently caused many victims.
This monster is said to be ["]soul-damaging["]. <cf>I don't know the details of what it means, but...
Its claws or its fangs? If wounded, it was feared that <cf>["]you will never return to the forest again ["]"].
For foresters, that is the most frightening thing of all. <cf>That's much more than getting hurt.
When I was a little girl, <cf>I used to be told not to go into the woods alone.
Yeah, I didn't get that monster. <cf>It's just that ...... kind of made my heart flutter.
And there have been a series of incidents in the forest recently. <cf>Maybe the increase in injuries is a sign of things to come.
I guess, that lore is a lesson to be <cf>prepared if things go wrong.
I wonder if ["]soul-damaging ["]means <cf>heart-breaking
That makes me think I don't have enough <cf>herbs on hand to use for distraction.
So I need you, the adventurers, to gather them. <cf>[It seems that the people of the township have not been able to help.
Can you help me with the "additional research on the 'Hanameguri' area? <cf>I'm sure we can find the herbs we're looking for.
Best regards. There's no one in or out of <cf>[township (sato)] to prepare for any eventuality.
You can find the herb of inertia at <cf>in "Additional Research on [Hanameguri].
I'm going to have to go to the back, so <cf>I'm going to have to take a little bit of your time. Sorry.
[I'm afraid that the people in the township are not in a position to help right now. <cf>Please take care of them.
Hello, you adventurer. <cf>Did you find any herbs for your attention?
Thanks. Which one is ....... <cf>Yeah, that's all I need.
It must have been hard work. I appreciate it. <cf>I'm going to dry the herbs now and store them.
I don't know if it'll help wounded souls, but <cf>it should be one of the things to be prepared for.
After death, the people of the forest become part of the <cf>forest through [life tree (meiju)]. Have you ever heard of this?
That's the <cf>right way for us foresters to end it.
But if the soul is damaged, it will not come true. <cf>That's what the folklore means when it says you can't return to the forest.
[Rejected by the tree of life, he wanders around <cf>with nowhere to go, unable to return to the forest.
I shuddered just talking about it. ...... <cf>Just think that's how horrifying the story is to the folks in the woods.
The day the medicinal herbs you've picked will be useful is <cf>I really hope it doesn't come to pass.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. <cf>I really appreciate you doing this.
If ...... you should not visit, but if you do <cf>then your deeds will help the people of the forest!
The people of the forest will not forget their debt of gratitude. <cf>I wish you the blessings of the forest. Thank you.
I'm keeping the herbs for my attention. <cf>You never know when you might need them.
Don't forget to be prepared, you adventurers. <cf>It's best not to be in the care of medicinal herbs.
Hah ....... If you brotha, <cf>when will you give up?
I'm still talking about the same old dreamy <cf>treasure hunt from a long time ago.
He won't listen to me when I tell him that the desert is dangerous. <cf>He's a real handful, my uncle.
Adventurers touring ruins, too? <cf>There are a lot of ruins buried in the desert.
If you find any treasures, sell them. <cf>You won't lose a dime.
Oh, I heard there's an oddball somewhere who keeps excavating <cf>for ancient treasures.
It would be interesting to see what you find! <cf>If you see him, talk to him.
A person looking for treasure in the desert: ....... <cf>If you know of anyone, let's look for them.
Hi, sometime adventurer. <cf>My uncle took care of you.
Remember me?　The oddball who keeps digging <cf>holes in the desert looking for treasure.
Oh, it's you. <cf>You're the adventurer who delivered the medicinal herbs and stuff to Terua.
I've been looking for the Meldrethite treasure ever since. <cf>As usual, I haven't found a single thing.
I don't have time to sell oil here <cf>and I want to get back to digging.
What nonsense are you talking about? <cf>The desert is dangerous right now, okay?
Adventurer. I know it's a bros thing, but <cf>could you please take down a few monsters for me?
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>There are stories of seeing "bloodthirsty wolves" in the desert.
Because of him, I can't get through the streets as much as I'd like. <cf>The peddlers are also getting stuck, and everyone is annoyed.
And yet when I broth it, it tries to continue excavating. <cf>I had to drag him back because it was too dangerous. ......
Han, monsters are nothing. <cf>I can't be intimidated by something like that.
I heard that once upon a time, there were <cf>a bunch of monsters in Meldreit too!
But they say our ancestors and soldiers fought bravely to protect <cf>the city.
I have the blood of those ancestors in my veins! <cf>I will not stop excavating just because of this!
You're talking about that again?　You can't fight bros. <cf>Leave it to the adventurers. Stay quiet.
I got him back to town, but he's like this. <cf>They don't even listen to me.
Sooner or later, I'm going to really take off, and that's why I asked <cf>Adventurer to help me.
Looks like [Dark Night Wolf] of [Bloodlust] is at <cf>[Twilight] of [Sea of Sand] - Free Search
Everyone in town is in trouble. <cf>Please, can you go and take them down?
The "Dark Night Wolf of Bloodlust" is located at <cf>in a place called "Twilight of the Sea of Sand: A Free Search.
It'd be nice if you could take down <cf>before the bros. start popping up.
Everyone in town is in trouble, so do me a favor. <cf>Have a safe trip.
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>You defeated the "Dark Night Wolf of Blood Hunger," didn't you?
Oh, thank you, adventurer! <cf>You can resume excavation right away!
That's all you do anymore ....... <cf>You've just been taken down and you need to calm down a bit.
Hey, you guys. <cf>Do you know about the "Dark Night Wolf of Blood Hunger"?
I heard they disappeared and the <cf>monster that was near the street is gone too.
Oh, this adventurer took care of it. <cf>I'm sure the merchant is relieved now, too.
I didn't know that. Thank you. <cf>Thanks to you, we're back in business.
I guess it was worth praying to your ancestors <cf>
Hmm?　That thing hanging in your bag is ....... <cf>Is that a medallion?　Looks like a very old one.
Oh, this is our traditional amulet. <cf>You see the unusual pattern on it?
He says this is the <cf>crest of the Meldrethite royal family.
Excuse me?　Meldlight!
Oh, you know what? <cf>but this guy doesn't deserve any of it.
My ancestors were residents of Meldreth, <cf>but the city was lost to desertification.
When they moved to Salamzart, <cf>the royal family did a lot of work for them.
They got the medallion at that time. <cf>If they sold it there, they could have made some money.
But the royal family gave up their positions and wealth <cf>to help him, so he kept it for safekeeping.
Now it's part of a legend that can't be authenticated, and the <cf>medallion has all but faded away.
Still, the debt of gratitude Accepted by our ancestors remains the same. <cf>This story has been passed down in our family from generation to generation.
I see that. ...... I didn't think so. ......
Oops, my bad. I've given you a boring old story. <cf>Well, let's just say there are stories like that.
Anyway, thanks for your help. <cf>You're a benefactor to my family, too. See you later, my friend.
I think I've seen that crest you just mentioned at our house. <cf>Is it possible that what you said about Meldreit is true?
Terua!　I'm going to keep digging! <cf>I'm going to keep on digging so I don't lose out to my fine ancestors!
I'm sure the day will come when you too will feel <cf>the pride of a meldrite!
Yeah, I guess so. <cf>Good luck, brotha. Don't overdo it.
Thanks again, adventurer. You've been a great help. <cf>Besides, I got some good stories.
I thought I'd remember the fine people of long ago, <cf>I thought I'd remember them too.
Broth has been <cf>more and more enthusiastic since then.
I went out early again today <cf>My relatives still don't look good ......
I've decided to meekly watch over them. <cf>I'm going to let him do it until he feels better.
It's been quite a while since the village of Galley Ridge was destroyed <cf>
I hear there were many skilled craftsmen in metalworking and craftsmanship <cf>
Now they are all scattered and the technology has been lost. <cf>So the monster's damage shows up in places like this.
It is a pleasure to see you again. <cf>Thank you for your help with The Fangworks of Khartoum.
You sniff out another business opportunity. <cf>You are indeed the man I have been looking up to!
This time I was looking for the "Galeridge Rainbow Clock". <cf>It is a clock that changes the color of its dial as time goes by.
It's been coveted as a fine antique. <cf>I would like to revive this "Rainbow Clock of Gulley Ridge.
They don't make them anymore. <cf>Because, as the name implies, it was made in the village of Galley Ridge.
You've been there before, haven't you? <cf>It's an abandoned village at the end of the Abandoned Galley Ridge Road.
Accepted by the monsters, the villagers were scattered. <cf>Now it's a stronghold of bandits.
The watchmaking process, the necessary skills and craftsmen <cf>seem to have been lost in the chaos.
But I was able to find a craftsman who lived in the village of Galley Ridge <cf>and talk to him!
This is an important clue. <cf>They say you need two materials to make a rainbow clock.
It looks like both can be found at <cf>in "Tomdrum's Hidden Mine, Free Exploration"
One is the "Chokusai Quartz". <cf>It's a special crystal used in the heart of a clock.
The other is "Combustite". <cf>It's a metal used to alter the brilliance of crystals.
We can get the minerals for the "chiseled quartz crystal. <cf>The problem is with the "Combustite.
I heard that over here you have to defeat Draug Alma to get <cf>
So, we need to collect and defeat them. <cf>I can only ask an adventurer as skilled as you.
Please give me "Chokusai Quartz" and "Combalite"! <cf>First, let's get the materials together and aim for the rainbow clock!
The materials for the "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge" can be found at <cf>"Tomdrum's Hidden Mine, Free Exploration."
Four "Chromatic Crystals". <cf>You should be able to get these by collecting the minerals.
And six "Converite". <cf>This one needs to take out Draug Alma.
To recreate the rainbow clock, start with the materials! <cf>You can do it. Please!
Thanks for the help. Looks like you've gathered the "Chromatic Crystals" and <cf>"Converite".
Wow, this guy is nostalgic. <cf>I bet it's from the "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge".
You've collected some good ones, adventurer. <cf>I know it was a lot of work, but thank you.
He was a craftsman who lived in the village of Galeridge. <cf>He once worked on a rainbow clock.
Well, I had a few when I was younger. <cf>I have fond memories of those watches.
When I heard that they were going to recreate that "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge" at <cf>, I had to come!
What do you think? Now that we have the materials, <cf>can we get to work on it?
I'm going to make a lot of rainbow clocks with this and <cf>make a lot of money!
Hmm, what is it? <cf>You're not just going to recreate one of these?
If you want to make a lot of them, <cf>you'd have to get all the artisans from the village to do it.
We need not only artisans, but also miners. <cf>We also need people to prepare food.
It took a whole village to make that clock. <cf>I could not have done it alone.
Well, I guess if you give me a few years, I can give you one <cf>
There was, indeed, ......!　There's no way a single person could mass produce a watch as elaborate as that <cf>......
It's not a very viable business if it takes years for one <cf>
I hope I didn't make you feel stupid. <cf>I'm sorry.
But hey, lady. And you, adventurer. <cf>I for one am glad to be a part of the Rainbow Clock again.
I thought it would be forgotten along with the village, but <cf>thus came the day to make it once more!
I don't know about business, but <cf>I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
...... I agree. It looks like the biggest gain in this case is to reproduce the "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge" <cf>
The materials you have worked so hard to collect are available at <cf>Let's make sure they are preserved for posterity so they don't go to waste!
It's not quite how I thought it would turn out, but I'm glad I asked <cf>you to do it for me.
I'll think about business again. <cf>I'll make another request then.
There are so many forgotten and <cf>lost masterpieces in the world!
It would be interesting to go around <cf>and reproduce them.
I wonder if we could get people talking about reviving <cf>one-of-a-kind items without having to make so many of them?
