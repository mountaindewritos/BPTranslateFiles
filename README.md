**ANNOUNCEMENT**
Starting July 5 2024: Future releases might take longer, possibly weeks or months, as we focus on improving the quality of the translation and fixing the UI.

# About Blast Protocol
This fan-made translation mod is our gift to everyone eagerly awaiting the official global release and wanting to experience the Japanese version of the game. 
Initially it was started as a Fully Machine Translation Mod for faster development but turned into Semi Human / Machine Translation due to some inconsistencies that the Machine Learning produced.
While some grammar and words are not entirely accurate, we are doing what we can to correct it.
**Map names are now sourced from [BP-DATA's Website](bp-data.net). Use a translation plugin on your web browser to view the translated map names.**
