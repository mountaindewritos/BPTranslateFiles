**ANNOUNCEMENT**
Starting July 5 2024: Future releases might take longer, possibly weeks or months, as we focus on improving the quality of the translation and fixing the UI.

# About Blast Protocol
This fan-made translation mod is our gift to everyone eagerly awaiting the official global release and wanting to experience the Japanese version of the game. 
Initially it was started as a Full Machine Translation Mod for faster development but turned into Semi Human / Machine Translation due to some inconsistencies that the Machine Learning produced.
While some grammar and words are not entirely accurate, we are doing what we can to correct it.

# How to Use a Server Patcher
**There are two Server Patcher tools**
For users of the patcher tool, I recommend deleting any versions of the patcher downloaded before the latest update.
Open **README** on each ZIP for Instructions.

1. Server Patcher 2024 - A new patcher made by MCE. Follow the instructions carefully.
2. Server Patcher Legacy - A working patcher made by [ArtFect](https://github.com/ArtFect/BP-translate)

# How to Uninstall
**Just Delete the files (dinput8.dll and ~mods folder) and you are good to go.**
**You may also delete the Server Patcher Files**

# Tips to avoid getting BANNED
- **Mandatory to have a VPN connected to Japan**
  
  _Commercial VPNs such as NordVPN and ExpressVPN are not recommended, as they can sometimes be detected by BanNamco and result in an account ban._

- **Keep Software Updated**
  
  _Ensure any legitimate patches or updates are applied promptly to avoid compatibility issues._

- **Do not alter game files**
  
  _Manipulating game files goes against the game's terms of service. We provide patcher tools solely for translating text and not for manipulating stats. Any bans incurred as a result of your actions are your own responsibility._

- **Know your friends**

  _Trust only those whom you know, and do not accept friend requests from unfamiliar individuals. If they discover that you are an overseas player, you may be reported_

- **Respect other players**

  _Play fairly and respect those around you. Avoid using emojis or actions that may annoy others, and refrain from being rude._

- **Don't talk on chat**

  _A general rule: Don't speak any other language besides Japanese, your party or teammates may report you, potentially leading to a ban._

- **Not a fool proof system**

  _Use the patcher cautiously as it may be detected in the future; therefore, use it at your own risk._
