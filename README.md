# Blast Protocol Translation Files 
Anime Game Translation Files

**Starting July 5 2024: All Upcoming Releases will be on hold to focus on the quality of the translation and UI fix.**

**Me and the other members of BP Translation Community revived this project with only one goal in mind...to translate the latest content in English without the use of external OCR tools that can hinder PC performance. With the help of AI thru Machine Learning we achieved the fastest translation with over 100K+ lines of pure japanese language. But as you may know, it has downsides, the words and phrasings are inconsistent. It has come to a difficult decision that I have to manualy check and edit 400k+ lines of code that includes the translated sentences and words. This is not an easy task especially I only have a limited resources that I can only use. Please bear with me. Thank you**
