A drink that activates engrams in the body when taken, and has the effect of healing wounds sustained in battle.
It is a blend of various types of incense. It is instantly effective, and is valued as a lifeline for a party of adventurers.
A picture of a figure that, when looked at, activates the engrams in the body and heals wounds sustained in battle. It seems that she has been completely captivated by it.
This is a picture that, when looked at, activates the engrams in the body and has the effect of healing wounds sustained in battle and other situations. It makes you want to love everything.
This figure has the effect of activating the engrams in the body and healing wounds sustained in battle. I would like to see her as a diva wearing glasses someday.
It is made from the juice of the fruit of the Magnia tree, which has existed on the Magna continent since ancient times, using an old-fashioned manufacturing method.
The effect of this item will be lost in the following cases
Loading of the game, death of a character, class change, start of some demos, and end of the game (including character select).
A chemical made by refining engrams. Applying it to weapons makes it easier for the adventurer's engrams to penetrate and increases the power of attacks.
A hard curtain is generated from the ore-derived engram to cushion impact. Some believers use it to feel the blessings of the gods of Buffalia.
A drink that uses a rare ingredient from the magnia tree to significantly reduce physical exhaustion.
A drug for adventurers that stimulates the eyes and gives vitality. It makes vision clearer and enables the user to strike a well-aimed blow.
The ingredients contain a large amount of engrams of the fire attribute. It promotes the circulation of biological engrams and improves the efficiency of their conversion into fire-attribute attacks.
It has the property of lowering the temperature around the user. It was inspired by the cooling material of the Buffalia legacy, but the principle has not been clarified.
It is made by mixing pieces of ore containing engram, which is a lightning element. The engram induces an insulating breakdown of the gas, enhancing the lightning attribute attack.
It is known for its distinctive manufacturing process, in which engram is injected into the ground and special soil that has been brewed over the years is extracted and used as one of the materials.
It reacts to engrams contained in fire-attribute attacks, making it resistant to them. Some people have been seriously burned by jumping into the blazing flames.
The oil and fat extracted from plants found in highland areas is blended to create resistance to the ice attribute. In northern regions, it is also used for protection against the cold.
It creates a layer of engram flow on the surface of the skin to deflect lightning strikes. Many carry it to prevent accidents in the ruins of Buffalia.

My son is a big Mount Imagine lover. He will be celebrating his birthday in the near future. So as a surprise, I would like to deliver a gift using Mount Imagine. I don't have a Mount Imagine, so could you please lend me your Mount Imagine for a little while?
I'm in trouble. ...... The girl who always delivers my food has been out sick. I'm at a loss for a replacement, and I could really use a cat's help. I need to deliver the food to various places before it gets cold, so I'm thinking of using Mount Imagine. Can anyone lend me theirs?
I teach self-defense to my kids and train them in all kinds of things. I was thinking of having them race against Mount Imagine. When the time comes, you are the one who can protect yourself. It is important to exercise and train on a regular basis. So, can I borrow Mount Imagine?
Hey~☆ I've been into Mount Imagine lately!　It's so cool to go to work on a cool mount, isn't it?　I'll show off my mount, too. Can I borrow it for a little while?　This is what Imagine research is all about!　Yo, shh, shh, shh!
We will be conducting research in the Evergreen Desert in conjunction with water quality control in the Salamzat area. We will be traveling long distances in the desert, so we will need Mount Imagine. If any adventurers have enough on hand, could you please lend them to us?
A client from far away ordered our vegetables. He said he liked the fact that we insist on freshness. Then we have to deliver the best vegetables!　Wouldn't it be great if we could deliver fresh vegetables to even the furthest corners of the world with our fast Mount Imagine? It's a business opportunity for our grocer!　I need to borrow Mount Imagine!
I'm a humble fortune teller. The other day, my cart with my tools of the trade broke down. I had no choice but to start my business there, but it's not a very good place to do it. This might be the reason why the cart broke down. I'd like to get around for now, so could you lend me something to stand on?
Thanks!　I'd like to do a new street performance using Mount Imagine. Don't worry, I'm not going to go through a ring of fire or anything dangerous like that!　I want to ride Mount Imagine and do tricks on it. If it works, I'll show you, so consider it an investment, please!　Right?
Do you know an adventurer named Pissarri?　I know him, but he hasn't come back since he went to the "Sea Rhythm Meadow" on a request. ...... She must be lost again, that girl!　Anyway, I'm going to pick him up, and I wonder if you could lend me your Mount Imagine?　If you don't do it quickly, you'll go to a crazy place and I won't be able to find you!
Our milk has been selling well lately. We appreciate that, but we are having trouble keeping our delivery hands full. And milk gets damaged very quickly. Eventually, we will put in place a system, but at any rate, we need to handle the orders in front of us. Can we borrow Mount Imagine for a little while?
We've been asked to sing for the comfort of the garrison in the "Andorra Basin. I would have turned them away if they had said, "It's a sacred act, so it's free," but they offered me a higher price!　I couldn't let it go like this, so I jumped in my Mount Imagine!　Thank you, God of Buffalia!
I've been getting a lot of calls for house calls lately. Can you lend me Mount Imagine so I can make a quick round to heal?　A quick turnaround, a quick recovery, a moment for the doctor, and a thankful patient!　What a surprise!　That's why I'm looking for adventurers who are generous enough to let me use their mounts!
I'm gonna feel the wind in my hair at ....... I want to be the fastest wind I can be, blasting past max speed!　If you're as good an adventurer as you are, you must have a real Mount Imagine ...... or even a "True Luck Doubt Weimajun"!　Please!　Let me have a taste of the real thing for once!
It's a perfect project ......!　If you fall down, you're out of business!　An Adventurer's Journey to Salamzat. We could sell this as a book!　First, we need to do some preliminary inspections. We need to check the route carefully so that the project doesn't fall apart. I'm sorry, but can we use Mount Imagine?
I want to fish a lot of spots on the Melissos River. I'm trying to put together a map of where the fishing spots are and what kind of fish we can catch. But I can't go to all the spots on foot, so I was wondering if I could borrow Mount Imagine. Is that a bad idea?　If I catch enough fish, I'll share it with the adventurers!
Isn't a suspenseful scenario a classic scene where you're chasing down a murderer on a cliff?　I'm practicing that, but I can't seem to get the image right. ...... I think I'd know what it's like if I actually went to the Valley of the Rising Sun and felt the atmosphere close to the scene of the crime!　But it's a bit far away and I need transportation. Can you help me?
I want to go to "The Wind-Stopping Wasteland" and I need to borrow Mount Imagine!　My dad has been hunting for some amazing big game. I'm going to go hunt for a catch that's as good as my dad's!　Besides, I want to be able to ride Mount Imagine someday. Please don't tell my dad!　I'm not going to do anything dangerous!
My son, Richter, is about to go hunting alone. I thought I would go check on him without him noticing, but it seems he is going away with Mount Imagine. I had to get a mount for this one as well. ...... May I borrow it for a while?　Please keep this confidential to my son.
The liturgy will be held at the Buffalia Temple in Salamzat. This time we have priests coming from far away, but the road to the Evergreen Desert is a tough one for those who are not used to it. Therefore, we are thinking of picking them up at Mount Imagine. We are wondering if you could lend us your car for a while.
I read in a book that there are many ruins on the "Evening Calm Terrace. When I asked about the possibility of going to see them, Mr. Isial of the Pioneer Bureau agreed to go with me. But there was only enough Mount Imagine for one person. Can you lend me another Mount Imagine for one more person?
I am a person who has bad luck on a regular basis, and I am trying various countermeasures. This time, I was wondering if I could wash away my bad luck by bathing in the pure water of the Fierre Pond!　It's always better to get these things done quickly. Please lend me your Mount Imagine to get to "Fiery Pond!
I've been trying to come up with a painting scheme based on the theme of "stillness and motion." Stillness is the ruins and movement is Mount Imagine. Mount Imagine standing in the ruins...... hmmm, I feel the elegance!　I can't help but paint it!　That's why I want to bring Mount Imagine to "Galley Ridge Abandoned Road". Is there anyone who would be willing to lend it to me?
The sand at Cape Lawehala is so beautiful that I brought it back to commemorate the event. But I lost the sand in the "Dust without Return". But I just can't give up. I will find it somehow!　Is there anyone who would be willing to lend me their Mount Imagine so that I can run around in a wide area?
This is the Duchy of Barnhart's army. We would like to patrol the "Rauleben Battlefield," but our mounted imagines are not in good shape and we have run out of them. Regular patrols are the most basic way to keep people safe. I would like to borrow a Mount Imagine so that I do not disrupt the schedule. Thank you in advance.
Ugh, my stomach hurts. ...... My soldiers left for an expedition, and then I received a sealed letter with an arrangement with upper management. If I don't give it to the field, it could be treated as a breach of discipline and punished without my knowledge. I need to chase them down as quickly as possible, so could I borrow Mount Imagine?　Oh, God. It's always like this: .......
I feel like I've gained some weight lately. My family told me to exercise and I decided to go for a run, but I didn't feel like I could make it to my goal distance. ...... Can I borrow your Mount Imagine so I can go home when I give up?　No, I won't cheat the distance by getting on it on the way!　Really!
Isn't the ocean at Cape Lawehala clean?　That's just people who notice and pick up trash to keep it clean. It's not that the ocean belongs to anyone, but people do it naturally because they love the ocean. I also pick up trash once in a while. Can I borrow Mount Imagine to carry the load?
I'm going on an expedition with my kids to "The Ghostly Valley of the Hidden Moon". I've made all the preparations I could for anything, but when I got together everything I needed for this and that, it turned out to be a pretty big load. ...... Now I need a Mount Imagine. Can someone please lend me one?
Woohoo, great catch, great catch!　I haven't caught this many fish in a long time!　I didn't expect to catch this many fish, though, so I'm having trouble carrying them around. I was wondering if you could lend me your Mount Imagine?　We don't always catch this many fish, so even if we hired someone, we'd have extra hands. I'd like to borrow it temporarily.
I asked the adventurers to gather materials for perfume at the Claw Trace of the Giant Dragon, and it seems that they found more materials than they expected. Rather than wait for them to bring them to me, I thought I would go myself. After all, you have to try the fragrance on the spot, don't you? Can I borrow some of your Mount Imagine?
I'm working on a new invention, but I still need more prototypes!　I want to try out all the ores that can be found in the Claw Trail of the Giant Dragon!　I want to bring back a lot of things anyway, so please let me use Mount Imagine. I want to bring back all kinds of things, so please let me use Mount Imagine. I'm sure it will lead to a great invention this time!
Did you know that you can take a picture of a crystal that looks like a flower called "Flower of the Wind of Sand" at the Bor'om Ruins?　It could be a hint for the design of the heritage site we are currently restoring. I heard a rumor that an adventurer got a hold of it just recently. If you go looking for it a few times, you might be able to find it. Can you lend me your mount-imagine for transportation?
Supplies will be delivered to the "Fettered God's Mill. Since the delivery route is intricately shaped, we will use mounted imagines, which can be maneuvered in a small radius. In order to complete the work in a short period of time, we will borrow and install a large number of Imagines. Anyone who can understand this content should respond immediately. Above.
In the "Valley of the Machine Ruins," many heritage sites and artifacts will be unearthed. However, there are many objects of unknown use, so we are sorting out the ones that look useful and taking them away. The rest are left behind. Don't you think that's a bad idea?　If this happens, I'll go and collect them at my own expense!　I want to bring back as much as I can, so I need to borrow Mount Imagine!
I have now come up with a new hypothesis!　If proven, it will surely overturn ancient history. For the sake of my research, I am going to check out the "Soundless City," but I can't read through the literature on foot. However, with Mount Imagine, I should be able to hit the literature while on the move!　We would love to have it on loan!
I noticed that some of the items I carried were missing!　I think I dropped it when I went through "The Woods Through the Trees" and it's at ....... I would like to look for it right away, so could you please lend me Mount Imagine?　Oh, it is possible that I dropped it somewhere else!　And anyway, I want to go look for it right away!
I'm mainly gathering materials and medicinal herbs in the forest, but I injured my leg by a trivial mistake. It's going to be difficult for me to go into the forest alone for a while. But as an adventurer, I want to respond to requests, and there are people waiting for medicine. If I had Mount Imagine, I would be able to go out to collect it even with this leg. Can you lend it to me until my injuries are healed?
We are going through the "Rainless Forest" for transportation, but we are short on rain gear and would get our goods wet. It is something we don't use in the desert, so please contact us at ....... For now, we will spread the cloth and make a simple roof. Can we borrow Mount Imagine to walk with us while supporting the cloth?
There's a little legend about the "Wind Spirit Stage." It is said that you can gather medicinal herbs that make your legs as fast as the wind just by drinking them. It's a story that raises eyebrows, but I find it romantic. However, I am not an adventurer, so exploring is not my specialty. I'd like to take a quick trip to Mount Imagine and come back, so can I borrow it for a while?
One of our regular adventurers is going to a place called "Scarlet Dye Forest" to do some long-term research. Since he won't be back in town for a while, I thought I'd prepare a preserved lunch for him. I'll ask a friend of mine to deliver them, so please lend me your Mount Imagine to carry the lunches!　Thank you!
I heard that there is a rare insect that only lives in the "Dawn Bug Fortress!　It's jinxed among fishermen that if you use it as bait, you'll catch a big fish. I can't help but try it out to show you the charm of fishing!　I don't know which one is the bug, though, and I'll catch it at random.
I'm taking on the hauling of materials to be found in "The Dwelling Place of the Spellbound. I'm often asked by well-heeled people who want something with a certain significance. I don't really believe in such things myself. By the way, my own Mount Imagine is not working well for some reason. It's interfering with my work, so I was wondering if I could borrow it for a while.
It is said that there is a huge treasure left behind by a fallen family in a place called "The Trace of Stealing Behind the Falls. It seems that some historical documents have actually been discovered. I am not interested in the treasure, but I would like to touch the historical documents. I would rather go there myself than be roughed up, so I would like to borrow Mount Imagine.
I have been asked to explore "Yellow Sand Cove," but my hair gets stiff after walking around in the desert. When I got home and took a shower, the water didn't soak into my hair at all, so it was very difficult!　It takes me about three times longer than usual!　I wonder if I can borrow Mount Imagine to get through the desert in one go?
I need to borrow Mount Imagine because I want to go to the "Old Trail of the Fallen Sun". The reason is ...... ummm!　My boyfriend dumped me!　I've been serious about him for a long time, but he didn't mean to do it. ...... I have no choice but to run around with my mount!　My mount is not working well at a time like this, please!　Please, someone lend me a mount!
Rumors of an unidentified creature in the vicinity of the "Carsdnor Ruins" have arrived. This kind of story is usually a misidentification, but now that the report has come in, the Pioneer Bureau cannot afford to ignore it. We need to go to the site until we can confirm the identity of the creature, so could we borrow Mount Imagine?　Oh dear. ......
I'm traveling all over the place to document the beauty of this world. I've been recommended the scenery in "The Sand Path of the Sea Moonlight," but it seems a bit risky for a mere traveler. I was wondering if you could lend me a Mount Imagine so that I can go there quickly and come back quickly.　I don't want to take any chances, so please do.
I'd like to borrow Mount Imagine so I can investigate the "Sopra's Trail. This is the place associated with Sopra, a great man of salvation who led his oppressed people across a rugged mountain. We want to see the site and let our imagination soar as we stage a play based on this anecdote.
I went to "Fierling Pond" to get some quality cooling water. There I saw a strange place. Is that the "Arsenal of the Exiled" as rumored? I can't help but wonder what kind of technology is in there. I'm just going to look around for a little while, so can I borrow Mount Imagine?　I'll be right back!
I want to strengthen my patrols of the "miasma mine" and its vicinity. I've talked to the Knights of Barnhart about it, but they can't seem to get the manpower to do it. For the time being, I'm going to use Mount Imagine and rotate with the current members. I wonder if I could borrow Mount Imagine until someone new arrives.
I'm going to do business in front of the "Cursed Glimmering Tomb. The price is 60 times the market price. Of course, I'm not going to sell it. It's a dangerous place, and I'm going to have to ask the unprepared adventurers to give up and go home. Some people won't listen to us, so we have to use this kind of trick. Can we borrow a mount-imagine to carry our gear?
A forest is not just a bunch of random trees, it's a well-tended forest. It's part of the lumberjack's job. It's time to go back to check on things, but there are no roads in the forest. Mount Imagine makes it easier to get around. Can I borrow it for a little while?
There is an old geological formation deep in the "Alston Abandoned Mine," and the Lord King has ordered me to investigate it. The disaster cannot be defeated by any number of powerful knights. The best defense is to accumulate accurate knowledge and limit damage. We will be bringing in a variety of research equipment, so we would like to borrow Mount Imagine for transportation.
Do you know a collector named Studs?　He's got a good eye and knowledge of stones, and we've had a lot of fun talking about them. But I'm a stone craftsman myself. I can't lose. I wanted to surprise him by finding an amazing stone. I'm thinking of going to the ford of the ledge to pick up some stones, and I was wondering if I could borrow Mount Imagine.
I want to go to the Ruins of the Giant Tower. Can you lend me Mount Imagine?　There are many theories about it being a tower, a tomb, a cannon, etc., but I don't think so. That's ...... yes, it's a vase!　It's an out-of-the-way ruin used by the majestic god of Buffalia to decorate the earth!　I'm off and running to find out the truth!
There's a card game that's been popular among soldiers lately. However, I lost one of the key cards in my deck in "Abandoned Leaky Mine" ......!　I need to borrow Mount Imagine to quickly retrieve it during a break at work!　Everything depends on that one card. ...... Wait for it, my strongest deck. ......
The newbie adventurer chicks who sleep over at my place left their ...... lunches behind. I'm not sure what to expect from the youngsters these days. I'm going to borrow Mount Imagine. Hmm?　I'd feel sorry for them if they were hungry!　Your lunch is getting cold, so I'm going to take you out for a quick run!
It was my first time to investigate the "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon!　All by myself!　It was a lot of fun, but I got into trouble. There were so many materials that I collected that I couldn't carry them without my mount-imagine. ...... I've been reminding myself not to get carried away. I don't have one yet, so can I borrow your Mount Imagine?
For the Buffalians, a pilgrimage to the "Mikazin no Mihashira" has a special meaning. Many of them want to see the "Pillar of the Divine Suspension" at first sight even after they are old. This time, there were more pilgrims than expected and we ran out of Mount Imagine. We are in need of a new one as soon as possible.
There is a rare wild bird near the "Valley of Kioto!　As a member of the "Wild Bird Watching Society" team, there is no way for us not to go and see it!　I will visit there together with my comrades, and I would like to borrow Mount Imagine as a means of transportation. I want to see the beautiful form of the bird with my own eyes!
I need a restful sleep. ...... I need a good night's sleep, but I can't sleep because of all the noise around me. Then a colleague of mine in the garrison gave me some advice. I thought "Soundless City" would be quiet enough, given the name, to help me sleep. I don't want to waste any travel time, so I was wondering if I could borrow Mount Imagine.
Ah, the bug, ....... It shines as if it were adding a polarizing color to people everywhere ....... I love bugs and am fascinated by them, so my greatest desire is to go bug-watching to my heart's content at the "Dawn Bug Fortress" ......!　I am sure I will have a dreamy time. For the sake of my dream, can someone please lend me a Mount Imagine?
We thieves have decided to get off our feet. After all this time, I'm thinking of returning the stuff we snatched back to where it belongs. But if we keep walking on our own feet, we'll never get it done. I know this is crazy, but can you lend us Mount Imagine?　Don't worry. I won't steal it anymore.
It became necessary to transport a large amount of materials at the "Fettered God's House of Production. There are a lot of small materials, and heavy machinery would be inefficient. We have the manpower, but we lack the means to move and transport them. There is an urgent need to replenish Mount Imagine. Those who understand this information should immediately apply for the loan of such equipment.
We are going to clean up the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings". It is a large and important place, and we must not neglect anything. The amount of cleaning supplies, food for the priests, medical supplies in case of emergencies, etc. ...... is too much for one person to carry. I am sorry. Can you lend me Mount Imagine?
I'd like to do some in-depth research on weather. I want to observe the movement of wind and clouds in detail from a high altitude. Therefore, I am planning to conduct observations and research around the "Ruins of the Giant Tower". I need to bring equipment and materials with me, so I would like to borrow Mount Imagine. Can you do that for me?
I'm interested in some of the materials that can be found in the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon. I think it could be a good commercial material if it is processed. However, I don't think it would be so easy to obtain. I'd like to see it in person. I would like to borrow Mount Imagine for transportation.
We are very grateful to have been given permission to enter the "Shinkake-no-Mihashira". Furthermore, I have been told that I may take some of the materials back with me for research. This is God's will, too. Even though it is material, we cannot afford to damage it. Can we borrow a Mount Imagine for transportation?
Treasures that were supposed to be lost were found in the "Traces of Stealing Behind the Falls. No, I guess it is generally called junk. However, we may be able to get a clue to the real treasure by guessing from these, don't you think?　That is why I would like to borrow Mount Imagine often to transport the pile of junk. I expect a good response.
It seems that monster activity is increasing at "Dawn Bug Fortress," and we are dispatching a survey team. My boss said that we can't ignore it, only the insects. ...... Ha. Leave the boring boss alone, it's a long way from here, so can I borrow your mount-imagine for transportation?
I heard there is a place called "The Dance of the Water Nymphs. As someone who wants to offer thanks to the Gods of Buffalia through dance, I am very curious about the name. It might help me refine my dance and lead me to the next stage. It seems a bit far, so I wonder if you could lend me a means of transportation.
We will be taking out materials from the "Fettered House of the Gods. These may be in violation of confidentiality and will only be carried out by authorized personnel. In order to reduce risk due to the time required for the work, a quick response using mounted imagines is required. Anyone who understands this content should respond immediately. Above.
My juniors went to the "Cursed Glimmering Tomb" saying it was a test of courage. I told them not to go there because it was dangerous!　Give me Mount Imagine!　I'll go get them right now!　I can bring them back all by myself. I'll beat up the kid who won't listen to me and drag him back. Hmph. .......
I had the opportunity to purify the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings" and I was accompanied by many priests. ...... It's a sacred place that's normally off limits, so everyone got a little overzealous. The items to be disposed of piled up like a mountain. We can't just leave them in the cathedral. We need to borrow Mount Imagine to get it out of here as soon as possible.
We would like to bring back some sand and rocks from the Kartoum Sandstone Corridor. The soil there is of very good quality, and we often use it to repair walls and roads. But it's just too heavy for us. We'll have to use Mount Imagine to carry it. I've been talking to a few people about it, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in lending me yours.
I used to ride my Mount Imagine all over the world. I was especially good at flying on mountain roads. My friends called me "Lightning bolt of the mountain pass. I haven't been around since I started a family, but sometimes I miss those days ....... Hey, let me relive the old days for a while, will you?
It seems that some troublesome people have entered the "Alston Abandoned Mine". Some bandits or something are up to no good. That's our hideout. We don't want them to escape, so we're going to take them out as fast as we can. I'll get back to you as soon as I can, so can I use Mount Imagine?
I need your help immediately!　I dropped my newly received medal in the sewers!　I can't let them think I threw away the medal. It must be stuck somewhere in the underground canal, and I must find it immediately!　I'll be there as soon as I can, so lend me Mount Imagine!　Oh, and please keep this story to yourself!
I have been working as a security guard at the "Royal Institute of Drava" for many years. However, due to my age, I can no longer do what I used to do. It is time for me to leave the job to my successor. However, it is physically difficult for me to stay with him and provide him with guidance. I apologize to my juniors, but I would like to talk with them while riding Mount Imagine. I wonder if I could use it for a while?
Various artifacts have been found in the "Valley of Plane Traces," including materials related to liquid memory. Your sister has asked you to help her recover them for research and later study. No, no, no, my senior!　Let's see, what was it? Anyway, she told me to borrow Mount Imagine and retrieve it!　I know it's a hassle, but just lend me some!
We were intensively defeating monsters at the Bor'om Ruins. One of my teammates was trying to make a new weapon and needed some materials. That was fine, but everyone was so enthusiastic about it that we ended up with a huge amount. Our own mounted imagines aren't enough, so I was wondering if we could borrow some for transport.
Currently, the Pioneer Bureau has a team of several adventurers who are conducting an intensive survey of the "Carsdnor Ruins. It is going to take some time yet, so we would like to have a supply system in place. Would it be possible to borrow Mount Imagine so that we can go back and forth between the camp and the site frequently? Thank you in advance.
In the "Old Underground Canal of Barnhart Castle," a large number of weapons discarded by Barnhart's army were found. If someone were to steal them, it would be a big problem. The order was to retrieve them immediately, but there were more than expected, and my subordinates were upset. He asked to be allowed to use at least a mounted Imagine, so we had no choice but to let him. I am sorry, but I would like to borrow it temporarily.
I'm a courier in Asterleaze. Recently, a monk came to me and asked to be my apprentice. He's never ridden a mount before. He's motivated and I'm not going to leave him alone. ...... Can you lend me a Mount Imagine to practice with?　I'll keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't ride recklessly, don't worry.
I'm editing a magazine, and the writer in charge wants to go to the "Ruins of the Giant Tower" to develop his image. I am a former adventurer, so I'll be fine, but if the teacher gets hurt, it would be a disaster. I would like to borrow Mount Imagine so that I can escape immediately in case of emergency.
I'm supposed to be working on a request with a fellow adventurer. There are two of us, and we're going to try to get all the different requests done at once. But he's a bit of a stickler for time, and he can't tolerate even the slightest deviation from the schedule. It's not good for his mental health to go around on foot. I'd like to prepare a mount for him.
I would like to borrow Mount Imagine for the "Dorava Royal Laboratory" investigation. On a mission like this, normally it would be enough to go on foot, but since my superiors demand a report every step of the way, I really need my feet. I would think that a soldier should run, but my superiors are very picky about that. I have no choice but to ask to use Mount Imagine.
I received a request for a song to accompany the climax of the play, a scene in which adventurers run through the "Valley of the Coral Rocks" on Mount Imagine, which is a very difficult order. ...... I am going to ask someone I know to actually ride the mount to get the inspiration. Can I borrow it for a while?
It seems that an unexplored mine shaft has been discovered at the "Tower Rock Mine Site." The adventurers broke up the large rocks that were blocking the entrance, but they turned into a considerable amount of rubble. There was no telling how long it would take to haul it out by hand. We would like to deploy a number of mounted imagines for efficient transport. Can we borrow them?
We are devising a route for training new recruits to board Mount Imagine. We have to confirm in advance whether it is actually viable as training. However, unfortunately, the Knights' mounts have been sent on a mission. Is there anyone who has Mount Imagine and can help the Knights?
The bridges in the Montenol Valley are deteriorating here and there. The Pioneer Bureau is working with the local residents to repair them. Thank you, thank you. And we're going to need some mounts for transporting materials. If you could lend me some, that would be great. They're not going to close the bridge to traffic, so you can go through as usual.
Oh my god!　A girl I've been corresponding with is coming to my house, but I thought I'd never see her anyway, so I lied and told her I had a cool Mount Imagine at home and that I'd give her a ride!　Can I borrow your Mount Imagine just for now?　You must have a cool one, adventurer!
I want to clean up the "Alston Abandoned Mine. It's closed and no one goes in there, but it's not safe if something goes wrong. We don't want any strange people getting in. I'll send someone to clean it up, can I borrow Mount Imagine for a leg up?　I want to make sure that only people I trust are involved there. Please.
A family asked me to do something for them in a dream. They are looking for their father, who was killed in the Carsdnor Ruins. I know it was only a dream, but they asked me to help them, so I had no choice. I'm going to find some relics and offer them to him. I'm going to search through the ruins, so I'm going to need my feet. Can I borrow Mount Imagine?
Thieves are hanging out in the vicinity of the "Soundless City. They don't seem to go inside, but this is a vile situation that concerns the dignity of Buffalia as a holy place. After deliberation, it has been decided that we will go there in person to explain the importance of that place and urge them to change their minds. Let's do the right thing. We need to borrow Mount Imagine for the move.
I found a client with a lot of feathers, and he said he's going to see the "Mayuki Throne" and he wants me to escort him. Well, if you go and come back soon, we can work something out. ...... However, it's hard indeed without the speed of Mount Imagine. I'm embarrassed to say I don't have any on hand. Can you lend me some while I'm on assignment?
Monster attacks have occurred along the route of the "Red Ore Quarry". It is an important place for the people of Salamzat to obtain building materials and supplies. I and a team of familiar adventurers have decided to reinforce our patrols, but we don't have enough mounted imagines. I'm sorry, but could we borrow them?
I'm planning a maze tournament in the Kartoum Sandstone Corridor with a group of junior adventurers. It will also serve as training for exploration. Of course, I will remove any danger beforehand, but I would like to have my mount-imagine ready for a quick escape in case of an emergency. My mounted imagines are not enough. Can you lend me one?
I heard that there is a team that is going to investigate the "Sienne Ruins".　The members of this team are all directionally challenged. If we wait for them to arrive, I'll turn into an old lady. Then Mea-chan will give them a special ride to the site. She's busy, too, so I wonder if she'll let me use her Mount Imagine.
My son is a soldier in Barnhart's army, and he will soon be going on a mission to defeat the dragon tribe. Even though it is his duty, I am worried about him. I am going to pray for his safety at least until he comes back to his hometown, "Kahuna's Cave". I wonder if you could lend me your Mount Imagine so that I can travel back and forth.
The trees of the "Silent Forest" in the "Koaniani Forest" are protected by the forest people. However, it seems that the number of diseased and damaged trees is increasing, perhaps due to the lack of help from your predecessors. I would like to go around and examine the trees, but the tools for this purpose are too heavy for me to carry alone. I would like to borrow a Mount Imagine for transport.
In the Zero Zone of the Tree of Life in the Koaniani Forest, there are trees that grow leaves that can be used to make medicines. However, we cannot pluck them from the trees. We have to collect the leaves that fall naturally. The leaves in the forest are so plentiful that it is difficult to distinguish them from each other. We have to just load them up and take them home, so I wonder if we can borrow a mounted imagin for transport.
The "Hidden Mine of Tomdrum," where bandits and ruffians come, seems to be used for shady dealings. So the adventurers from the Pioneer Bureau took turns keeping watch. But long hours on guard duty can make you hungry!　With only a limited number of people to take turns, we decided to stock up on food during our break. Can I borrow a Mount Imagine to carry it all at once?
I have a client who wants to use the sand from "Götterdämmerung in the Sea of Sand" for his garden. He says he needs it to express a thought. He wants to put the sand in his garden and draw water patterns on it. Why not just make a pool with regular water?　I'll go back a few times to get sand for the prototype, and I'd like to borrow Mount Imagine for transportation.
You, you have a nice Mount Imagine, don't you?　Actually, I'm testing an existing Mount Imagine on the course of "Kirikai Jukai" to use as a reference for a new Mount Imagine. That feeling of being in the wind with Imagine ...... hahahaha, I can't get enough of it!　I would love to have your help!　Don't worry, I won't make it bad!
My son insisted on crossing the ocean. Well, he was born and raised in Jubilia. Every man has to go to sea someday. As a parent, I can at least provide him with a good luck charm. I want to go to the Cave of Kahuna to collect materials that are bathed in the prayers of this land. It's a bit far away there, and I need to borrow a mount-imagine to get around.
It doesn't make much sense, but the "Zelma Mine Site" is owned by our family on paper. That place is already closed, but if my ancestor's diary, which was found the other day, is correct, we may still find an untouched deposit. Please lend us your Mount Imagine to haul away the debris that has accumulated in the tunnels for our investigation.
The "Flower Touring Tree Cluster" is a place where grass and flowers grow thick, and I've been weeding it regularly. So I thought I'd do it for the first time in a while, and I found that the grass had grown more than I had imagined. ...... I've only left it alone for a couple of years, though, right?　The plucked grass is too much for me to carry by myself, so please lend me a mounted imagine to carry it on.
The "Toonella Road" is a treasure trove of flowers and grasses, and it is full of lovely fragrant flowers!　My mother and I process them into perfume, which is very popular among the foresters. However, we had to keep up with carrying the flowers for the materials because of the overlap of orders. ...... I would like to transport them all at once in Mount Imagine, so please lend me the flowers for a little while!
The "Arsenal of the Exiled" is a factory of an ancient civilization, and may be related to an ancient city called Ruins of Auguras. I have visited both places several times for my research, but walking on my own is tiring and dangerous!　I need to borrow Mount Imagine to get back and forth between the two cities!　It's for my research!　Thank you!
I intend to hold a ceremony to honor my ancestors at the "Ancestral Gravesite," but the tools I need are too many and bulky. Only a limited number of people are allowed to enter that place, but we are allowed to have a mount-imagine loaded with tools waiting at the entrance. That alone would make the preparation easier, so could you lend me your mounted imagin?

A ranged attack is deployed from the amp during the melee attack, and the fourth-stage remote attack deploys a ranged attack when the amp hits. When attacking while moving left and right, the second stage is derived from a ranged attack centered on the attacker and the amp. If the normal attack button is pressed and released, a ranged attack centered on the amp and himself will be derived, and when the heat gauge is at its maximum, a ranged attack will be performed while activating the High Spirit state. When in high spirit state, the range of the 4-round combo's ranged attack is expanded and the damage dealt is increased. The range of left-right derived attacks and ranged attacks is expanded, and the frightening effect is enhanced.

If it is a buff T-skill or a front-derived attack, the effect is "Damage reduction - medium"; if it is a debuff or an attack T-skill or a left- or right-derived attack, the effect is "Damage increase - small".
If it is a recovery T-skill or a backward-derived attack, it will deploy "Increased Recovery - Medium".

My name is Kohs.
I'm an adventurer who has been an Aegis Fighter for quite some time.
There are many skills to be learned as an Aegis Fighter, as it supports the front line and, in turn, the party.
What do you think? Would you like to work with me on a request?
I'm sure I can teach you some things about Aegis fighters.
I, for one, would be glad to have more people I can rely on.
Hi, I'm Aegis Fighter Kohs.
I heard that monsters are appearing in Minsterhorn.
It seems to be a belligerent one.
Livestock and people are being targeted intensively.
That's why we've been asked to send an Aegis fighter who excels at fighting while defending.
I would be reassured if you would come. Can you lend me your strength?
I also need your help, okay?
The job I'm undertaking now is to deliver "High Helm Beans.
After that, I hear you have another favor to ask. I think I'm going to need a little help.
I don't think it's going to be too rough, but it would be great to have you here.
Thanks for your help.
Hey there. I'm Aegis Fighter Cors.
I'm not sure what's going on yet, but I've been hearing some disturbing things around ...... Litze.
There are some disturbing things going on around Ritze.
I've been asked to look into it and do something about it if something is really going on.
I have received a request to look into it and do something about it if something is really going on.
Can you help me with this request again?
I'm on my way to Litze, and I'd like you to come with me.
This is Aegis Fighter Coase.
I asked you before to help me if something happened to me in Litze.
I asked you to help me when something happened in Litze, didn't I?　Well, something has happened.
I heard that a powerful monster appeared around Litze.
And it seems that this monster has a history with me.
Please, I need your help. I need your help.
I need you.
My name is Manuel!　I'm Twinstriker, and I'm gonna be a hero someday!
Are you a Twinstriker too?　Then come with me to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Actually, my friend who was supposed to go with me fell ill with a stomach ache.
He's a Twin Striker too, so it'll be easier if we have the same Twin Striker with us.
Let's work on each other's skills!　Good luck!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I got a request to take down the enemy. Wanna go with me again?
I want to introduce you to my friends.
"There's a great guy out there, just like the hero we're trying to be!" You know, like the hero we're trying to be.
Heh, let me brag a little about how I met you.
So, please do me a favor!
There is an amazing trick that Achim the Hero used to do.
It's called "Vortex Impact"!
It's cool, isn't it?　I want to use that technique too!
Please help me find out how I can use it!
I'm practicing "Vortex Impact". I'm practicing "Vortex Impact".
So, I'm thinking of visiting the places associated with our heroes. Is it called a pilgrimage to a holy place?
Maybe there are hints left there about how to become a hero.
Let's go together!
Hero Achim's Quad Arm Defeat: ....... It's a legend I've always wanted to try someday.
So I found <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/> but something is wrong. If we let it go, it might attack Litze!
Will you fight with me to protect Litze?
Hello!　I am Lili, a blast archer.
Are you interested in becoming a Blast Archer?
Yes, I am!　Because that's what you look like!
Let's follow the path of Blast Archer together!
And if you are so inclined, please contact me at ...... for help with any requests I receive.
Let's help each other as Blast Archers!　Hey, I'm a Blast Archer!
Hello, I'm Lili, a Blast Archer!　I'm Lili, a Blast Archer.
I am amazed at how quickly you have mastered the bow.
You have a real talent as a Blast Archer!
With a little more practice, I'm sure you'll be very active soon!
Actually, I accepted the request to <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>defeat you, too, just for practice.
Since we're here, let's challenge it together. Hey, right?
How about practicing with a bow?　I have something I'd like to challenge myself with. I'd like you to accompany me if you like.
It's a battle unique to the Blast Archer - anti-air combat!
Flying monsters are troublesome opponents, but we can attack them from a distance.
Let's train now so that we won't panic when the time comes!
I found him!　It's him!　The Sky Serpent!
The guy from Litze said he saw him on the road.
It was only a few minutes ago, so he must still be around!
My brother's avenger!　Please, I need your help!
I've been looking for the Sky Serpent for a long time and finally found it!
I found his nest at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>!
If it's where the nest is, we won't lose him or lose him.
This time, we will end this!　Please fight with me!
I'm ...... what was your name?
You're ...... Sailor? Yes, Sailor. Yes, I'm Sailor.
I am Sailor and I have a favor to ask you.
I need to kill some <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>, but I can't do it by myself for some unforeseen reason.
I am at a loss on all sides, and I am really in trouble.
If you would like to help me, I am Sailor.
Hi, it's me, Sailor the Spellcaster.
...... is a bit complicated.
This time I want to get some ore from the Asteria Plains and some engrams from <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>.
The former, but not the latter, will have to be fought for.
Still, I really need them for my purpose.
Please, I need your help. Please do.
It is I, the spellcaster Sailor.
Or, to be more precise, I am the Imagine that possesses Sailor. This is getting more and more complicated.
I need your help to rectify this situation and return the body to Sailor.
I want to extract an engram from the grave of a great man.
He is like a common ancestor to us spellcasters. ...... Would you be interested?
This is me, the Imagineer who haunts the spellcaster Sailor.
I wonder if I can do something about this long name.
This time, I would like to collect my biological engrams as a Sailor. I have found a few tools that I used before I was born.
But both of them are in a monster's lair.
I need your help. Can you help me?
I'm Slaft, the spellcaster's sailor.
I really appreciate your help in collecting the engrams.
I was getting ready to return the body to Sailor, but there wasn't much grace.
I can no longer hear Sera's voice.
At this rate, Sailor's consciousness would disappear in the not-too-distant future.
This is my last request as Sailor.
Please, can you hear me out?
Hey there!　My name is Maschietta. Nice to meet you!
You're a heavy smasher too, huh? I love it. The exhilaration of defeating an enemy with a heavy blow!　I can't get enough of it!
Well, since we're here, I'll give you a lecture on the weapon of the Heavy Smasher.
Let's <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/> go out and smash them together. Better learn by doing than by learning by doing, right?
Hey, it's me!　It's Maschietta.
How's the heavy smasher training going?　This time, I'd like you to come along with me for a bit of work.
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/> and defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. Easy, right?
Actually, my mentor told me to learn to cooperate with my friends. You can't do that alone.
I think it would be a good learning experience for you, so why don't you come with me?
I was about to go away to look for my mentor, but then I heard something I didn't like.
I heard that a kid from Minsterhorn went out to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/> and never came back.
The people there have been very kind to me, and I can't just leave them there.
I need your help. Is that a bad idea?
I went to L'Alpar to look for my mentor, but there was a bit of a commotion.
I heard that some of the food and stuff they keep in storage got broken into. It sounds familiar, or ...... a little curious.
I'd like to go to Ralph's and check it out. Can you help me?
Remember the baggage raid at L'Alpar?　It was the Highland Fox herd that did it.
Well, it seems that the exact same thing has happened again!
This time, the pack was led by Sapphire Trot. I remember him. I remember this guy!
This time I'm going to defeat the Sapphire Trot!
My name is Karanto. I'm your senior Blitzlancer!
You're the new Blitzlancer, right?
I'm here to teach you how to fight in this class.
I've been a BlitzLancer for a while now, so I should be able to teach my juniors how to fight!
First of all, let's actually try to defeat monsters.
The shortest way to get stronger is to actually fight!
Hey there!　I'm Caranto, a senior BlitzLancer.
How's your BlitzLancer training going?
As a senior, I'm going to teach you something new!
But it's boring to just fight, isn't it?　I was the same way.
I got just the right request at the Pioneer Bureau, so let's do that and practice Blitzlancer at the same time.
It's my duty as a senior to keep the juniors occupied!
I know this sounds pathetic, but can you help me out?
Actually, I have two requests I have to do right now. I'm in a good mood and took on the job at once. ......
I don't think I can finish it by myself!
Sorry!　Please help!
Remember the story about the spear called "Zenith Shaft" that my senior is looking for?
There was a merchant who knew about it!
I want to find the Zenith Shaft. If I can find it before my senpai does, I will grow so much.
I'd like to hear what he has to say, and I'd like you to help me.
I heard there was an ogre in the Montenol Valley.
I'm kind of curious about that. It's close to where the adventurer with the Zenith Shaft went missing.
And it was only recently that the ogre appeared.
Maybe Mr. Rugel doesn't know about it yet.
Would you be willing to look into the clues in "Zenith Shaft" with me?
I'm Glenn, the beat performer!　Han, I'm going to ring again today!
You're a beat performer too, right?　You sound pretty good!
There's so much more to being a beat performer that people don't know about yet.
You're a new class and you need to show off your skills!
Come work with me on your requests and let's see how good beat performers can be!
I've found another request that people have been avoiding. I've taken it on.
Can't you help me out like you did before?
The client is a pharmacist from Minsterhorn.
He's a very eccentric old man, and he doesn't want to get involved with anyone.
That's why we're going to take care of it!
We're trying to improve the image of beat performers!
We're looking forward to working with you again!
We got a request from the Pioneer Bureau, naming us by name!
Well, technically, it was a request for beat performers. We were the first to say yes and take the job!
It's very motivating to be a beat performer when you know you are expected to be one!
The client is interested, so let's show them what we can do!　Let's show them what we're made of!
This time, the request came from the Buffalia cult.
There are a lot of loudmouths there. To tell you the truth, I don't want to do it either. ......
Nadris was not a fan of the beat performers, but he got the job done, didn't he?
I don't think I should complain about it either.
Let's show them that we'll answer the cult's request properly!
I got a request from the Order of Buffalia. They say there are monsters along the pilgrimage route.
They want me to escort the pilgrims and take them out if necessary.
My brother, Nadris, and Nadris' father are also going to be on the pilgrimage, so this is a great chance to show them off!
If we show them the results, no one will complain!
It won't be an easy job, but let's go with spirit!

When I woke up, I was in a place I did not recognize.
There was nothing I could remember except my name. It seems that I have amnesia .......
On the other side was a young subhuman girl, Feste. She seemed to have taken a liking to us after we rescued her from the goblins.
However, I wonder how it is that I was made her "servant" before I knew it. ......
The place where she met Feste is said to be "a recently discovered ruin. There may be clues to her memory there.
Considering the future, it would be more convenient for me to become an adventurer.
Pass the exam and register as an adventurer.
My life as an adventurer has begun.
As you take on requests, meet people, and travel to different places, you will naturally be searching for memories.
First of all, I decided to take on a good paying job that Jake would introduce me to.
I wonder what it will be like. ......
In "Claws of the Giant Dragon," I encountered the legendary monster "Avaritia. In addition, a mysterious boy named Merlouf, who descended from the sky, told me the word "kurisha," which means "the coming one.
Are these related to lost memories?
I would like to find out more, but Feste refuses to listen, saying that he is going to the Coin Pavilion.
It's because Jake blew him off and said that the husband would buy him a drink. ......
I was able to hear about "The Visitor" from the Buffalian priest Wahlkin and his disciple Myrlene.
They told us that the "Visitors" are gentiles with special powers.
The secret is said to lie in the "Kangake no Mihashira," the most sacred place of the Buffalian religion, which stands tall on the Bahamar Plateau.
At the "Shinkake no Mihashira," I met Erinze and Tirith, who came from 1,000 years in the future.
They said that they were going to liberate Avaritia and save the planet from the coming doom.
We agreed to cooperate with them.
Tirith immediately asked for a favor.
An anomalous reaction of engrams appeared in Omnistron.
There is a strong possibility that it is avaritia.
Let's cooperate with Erinze and the others and succeed in liberating Avalitia.
A request from the owner of Coin Pavilion.
It seems to be a simple errand, but the item to be delivered seems to be a very bad one: "Once you get a taste of it, there's no going back.
Feste, who had been talking with a stray cat in a mysterious manner, suddenly asks him to go and get "horngoat meat.
This is also the role of a servant, so I obeyed without asking any questions.
A simple job of delivering a letter to the priest of Minsterhorn.
However, there was a secret of Jake's hidden in there that I was not allowed to touch.
The owner of the coin-operated pavilion entrusted me with a mysterious job that he was originally going to ask someone else to do.
I should be prepared to take some risks.
Tillis suddenly started asking questions of a boy he didn't know.
Did he get some important information ......?
His expression was full of impatience and determination.
Erinze and Tirith were talking about something interesting.
We may be able to catch a glimpse of some of the secrets of these two mysterious people from the future.
A snooty rich man offers her a job.
He says he wants to donate an expensive, rare, and beautiful item that will attract the interest of the oracle priestess. ......

We finished our exploration of the Lake Tunnel.
However, we were not told that such a powerful enemy - an ogre - would appear in the innermost part of the tunnel.
According to Feste, it was "too tough for a novice adventurer.
Even so, we managed to defeat it.
With this, we should have passed the test.
Let's report this to Mury.
Deep in the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon," we found a powerful monster and somehow managed to defeat it.
According to Feste, this monster is called "Avaritia," a being that lives beyond time and space.
Why does this monster, the monster of adventure tales, exist?
And who am I ...... to have defeated it?
Jake went first to the Pioneer Bureau to report the situation, saying, "I have to warn people about the Avalitia.
Just then, a boy descended from the sky.
The boy, whose name was Merlouf, left behind a mysterious tweet, "The Visitor.
What does this have to do with his memories?
Feste seems to have heard the word, but he can't remember it.
For now, let's go back to the pioneer station and get a reward from Jake.
We rescued Wahlkin, who was attacked by a monster at the "Ruins of the Giant Tower.
When I asked him about the "visitors," he began to spout off his own theories.
The "visitors" are gentiles with special powers, he said. They are also considered by some to be the bringers of misfortune.
Wahlkin claimed that the founder of the Buffalian cult was also a "visitor" from another world, and he was transferred to the left from the cult's headquarters.
Wahlkin passionately argued that if one were to check out the "Mikazake no Mihashira," the most sacred site of the Buffalians, he would be able to find out more about the "visitors.
...... Anyway, Wahlkin was able to find it without incident.
I will report this to Myrlene in the village of Minsterhorn.
On the top floor of the "Kaminzake no Mikashira" was a sealed avaritia.
As I approached, a dazzling sphere of light suddenly appeared, and two girls appeared from within. Furthermore, Avaritia was unsealed and went on the rampage, attacking the girls.
The girls were somehow able to fight off the avaritia, but their true identities were unknown. They were still under strong caution.
And then...
The walls of the room shattered, and a new intruder appeared.
Voldigen, the king of the largest and strongest dragon tribe.
His overwhelming power ate through Avalitia, and even kicked out the elite gatekeepers.
Voldigen set his sights on us and approached slowly.
There was no escape, no choice but to fight.
Just when we thought that, the girls created a sphere of light. We dove into the light as they called us.
When the light disappeared, I was enveloped in a floating sensation - Voldigen's figure suddenly vanished, and Avalitia, whom I thought I had defeated, was sealed in the ceiling.
It was as if nothing had happened.
I asked the two girls what had happened.
Their names are Erinse and Tirith. They said that they had escaped from Vordigen by jumping through time through "chronoleap.
It is hard to believe, but when I was leaving the "Shinkake no Mikashira," I passed "Myself and Feste" coming in. ......
We saw ourselves in the past. I guess it means that they really jumped through time and went back to the past.
Perhaps it was the effects of the chronoleap, but Erinze was in pain.
We decided to return to L'Alpar to calm down for the time being.
I got the parts Tirith asked me to get.
I'll deliver it as soon as possible.
It was still Abaritia that reacted to the omnistron.
Erlinse performed the "Liberation Ceremony" for the defeated Avaltia. The Avalithia, enveloped in a solemn myriad of lights, vanished as if guided by Erinze.
Avalitia is a being that arises from the distortion of time and space by killing its past self. That is Avaritia.
Only Erinze can correct the distortion and restore the twisted causality.
However, the ritual is also an act that wears Erinse down.
We decided to return to Litze once more to let Erlinse rest.
Returning from the cliff ruins, we spoke with Jake again, and he introduced us to Muly, the guide girl from the Pioneer Bureau.
As soon as she saw the "Imagine" we had obtained at the ruins, she recognized it as a "Goblin" Battle Imagine.
It was not particularly rare, but it was a lucky find.
To become an adventurer, one must take an examination.
Mury is in charge of this, so we will hear more about it from her.
I passed the registration test and became an adventurer.
Now I can accept requests from the Pioneer Bureau. However, Mullie advised me to remember to raise my "adventurer rank" as well.
The higher your rank, the more competent you are as an adventurer, and the more rewarding the requests you receive and the more dangerous the places you can go to.
To raise your rank, you need to complete the "Adventure Board. The first one was received from Mury.
He also gave me a "Glory Coin (GC)" as a reward for defeating an ogre in the "Lake Lido Tunnel.
The GC could be exchanged for various items at the "Souvenir Exchange.
Jake said, "If you become an adventurer, I'll introduce you to some good paying jobs.
I decided to go see Jake and report back to him.
Jake gave me a reward for my request and some information that caught my attention.
Recently, unidentified creatures have been sighted in various places. It is rumored to be an avaricious creature.
He also said that the period of increased sightings coincides with the time when the dragon tribe began its rampage.
Jake will continue to follow up on this information.
Incidentally, the owner of the Coin Pavilion also offered to buy him a drink to celebrate the accomplishment of his request.
When Feste heard this, he changed the color of his eyes and said, "I'm going to the coin-operated pavilion! and the color of his eyes changed.
As soon as they saw each other, Wahlkin and Myrlene began a heated discussion about the "Ruins of the Giant Tower" and ancient civilizations.
He is ...... in good spirits, but he doesn't seem to be listening to our questions anymore.
The secret of "The Visitor" may lie in "Kamikake no Gobashira.
Let's go there next.
Erlinse and Tirith are said to have come from 1000 years in the future.
Their goal is to liberate Avalithia.
The mere existence of Avaritia distorts space-time, and the accumulated distortion will engulf this planet.
In the not-too-distant future, this planet and the world will be destroyed.
If the distortion is still small, it can be dealt with. For this reason, the two came to the present day by means of chronoleap.
However, the chronoleap is a serious secret and must not be known to anyone.
Tirith, with his sword at his side, has given him a choice: "Cooperation or death.
To save the stars, there was no choice but to cooperate.
Both Erinze and Tirith bowed their heads to our answer, as if they did not want to force us to do anything.
Thus, we helped Erinse and Tirith liberate Avaritia.
It is worrisome that even Tirith signed a servant contract under Feste's dictum, but .......
While Tirith was repairing the omnistron, I talked with Erinze.
She told me that people like them, who came to the city with chronoleaps, used to be called 'visitors'.
Erinze said that she could understand the fluctuation of the engrams peculiar to the "comers. However, she does not see any characteristics that would indicate that she is a "comer.
Was Merlouf wrong?
When the repaired omnistron was activated, a response was seen in the Montenol valley.
Erlinse and Tirith are going ahead with a field survey. They also gave me a child omnistron for communication.
Tirith apologized and thanked us for what we had done until the liberation of Avaritia.
It seems that she had her own share of heartache.
In order to avoid a future of destruction, the liberation of Avaritia by Erlinse must continue.
However, even the dragon king Voldigen stands in the way. According to Tirith, Voldigen is also an avaritia, and he enhances his own power by feeding on other avaritia.
If the avaritia is not released before the vordigens, the planet will still be destroyed by the vordigens that have taken in its power and distortions.
In order to protect the world and save the future, he promised again to lend his strength to Erinze and Tirith.
Asterreise, let's go outside the Two-Faced Coin Pavilion.

First, let's greet the innkeeper.
Let's go to the counter on the first floor.
Feste seems to be a familiar face with the proprietor of the "Two-Faced Coin Pavilion.
And it seems that the bill for the inn is piling up. ......
The owner advised him to be prepared if he was going to leave the city.
The name of the city is Asterleaze.
It is said to be the largest trading city on the Magna continent. Buildings line the streets, and the streets are crowded with people.
The streets are lined with buildings and crowded with people.
It really is a big city.
First of all, let's go to the "Town Gate Square" at the entrance of the city.
There is a huge transfer portal in the square.
Using this portal, you can get back to the city immediately.
Touch the portal to register.
I registered the transfer portal at the Asterleaze town square.
Now we are ready to go.
Let's go out of the city and look for clues to memory.
When we left Asterleaze, we found a spacious plain.
This is the "Asteria Plains.
Various plants and ores can be found here, and the ruins of Buffalia are scattered about.
Monsters also appear ahead. Be on your guard.
Let's head for the "Cliff Ruins" where we met Feste.
There you may find clues to your memory.
At the "Cliff Ruins," we got into a fight with goblins.
Some of the monsters seem to act in packs. Be careful when fighting them from now on.
This is where I met Feste. This is where I woke up.
Will I find anything?
I found "Imagine" in the place where I woke up. It is a crystal that combines the will of the engram and the creature.
It is a crystal that combines the will of the engram and the creature.
It holds various powers, but does not seem to be a clue to memory. There was nothing else to be found.
There was nothing else to be found.
As I was about to go outside, I thought I heard a strange voice. But there was no one there.
But there was no one there.
When I left the ruins, I met an adventurer named "Jake. He spoke in a lighthearted manner, but was known as "Jake" in Asterleaze.
He spoke in a lighthearted manner, but he was well known in Asterleaze and seemed to be in charge of organizing the adventurers.
Jake said, "If you are going to be an adventurer, you must be a good one.
Jake promised to introduce me to the Pioneer Bureau if I would become an adventurer.
Jake promised to introduce me to the Pioneer Bureau if I wanted to become an adventurer. Feste also suggested that I register as an adventurer.
He said, "You may be concerned about your memory, but first you need money! He said. ......
However, I knew I would be in trouble if I didn't have a job. We should go to the settlement office and see what Jake has to say.
I think it would be a good idea to go to the settlement office and ask Jake what he has to say.
We were assigned to search for the Lake Tunnel.
It is the remains of an old tunnel in the "Sea Rhythm Meadow.
Monsters have inhabited the tunnels since they were closed, but the danger is not that great.
If you reach the deepest part of the tunnel, you will pass the test.
The "Lake Tunnel" can be accessed through a "star vein hole.
These tunnels are said to be located all over the country and lead to various places such as ruins and caves.
When you find one, remember where it is.
Jake and I decided to go with him to defeat the monsters.
It seems that a boar-like beast has appeared in the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon. It is said to be "a bit of a bad guy" that is tougher than ordinary monsters.
The reward for this is a good one.
Let's meet up with Jake in front of "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon.
I met up with Jake in front of the Claws of the Giant Dragon.
Let's explore "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" together with Feste and Jake and defeat the monsters.
The "My husband will buy you a drink" was a trap by Jake to get Feste to have a drink. ......
After a brief argument, Feste brought up the subject of the word "visitors" left by Merlouf.
The husband told him that it might have something to do with the Buffalian religion. However, he didn't seem to know the details.
There is a huge temple of the Buffalians in Asterleaze.
I decided to inquire about the "Visitor" there.
The priest told me, "You must not talk about 'the visitors' so indiscreetly.
The priest chided me, and I was not able to ask him about the details of the visitors.
However, a girl who was looking at me from behind a pillar told me that I could find out something if I went to Minsterhorn.
The mysterious girl disappeared as soon as I took my eyes off her.
There were no other memories or clues to the "visitor.
Let's follow the girl's words and go to Minsterhorn.
In Minsterhorn, I met a woman named Myrlene.
She told me that her mentor, a priest named Wahlkin, knew a lot about the Visitors.
However, Wahlkin went to the "Ruins of the Giant Tower" to investigate and never came back.
Myrlene, who was worried about him, asked him to help her.
Let's go to the "Ruins of the Giant Tower" to look for Wahlkin.
The "Ruins of the Gigantic Pagoda" is the greatest holy place of the Buffalian faith, where the founder of the Buffalian faith is said to have alighted.
Because of this, we were turned away by the gatekeeper, who told us that we could not enter without permission.
No matter how much Feste cajoled and scolded him, it seemed that what could not be allowed could not be allowed.
We wondered if we could get a permit from somewhere.
Let's have a strategy meeting at L'Alpar.
In Lalpar, I heard a rumor about a group of pilgrims of the Buffalo-Brazilian faith.
Recently, the city of Berkmar was attacked and destroyed by a strange monster.
A Buffalian pilgrimage group is visiting the city to mourn the victims of the attack.
Some of the pilgrims are of high rank, such as chief priests and oracle priestesses.
Perhaps they may be able to get permission to enter the "Mikazake no Ojibashira" (the "Pillar of the Divine Suspension").
Let's go to Berkmar and meet the pilgrims.
In Berkmahal, I met again with the mysterious girl I had met in the temple of Astélize.
When I told her that I wanted to enter the "Shinkake no Mihashira," she somehow gave me a permit.
Who in the world is she?
Before I could ask her, she walked away again.
Anyway, I got the permit. Let's show it to the gatekeeper of the "Kamikake no Omashira.
When I showed him the permit that the girl from the pilgrim group had given me, the gatekeeper could not hide his surprise.
It seemed that the permit was genuine. After some hesitation, the gatekeeper finally let me through.
With this, we could enter the "Shinken no Omashira.
We headed for the top floor in search of clues about the "visitors.
Tirith and the others have a device called an "Omnistron" that searches for avaricious visitors.
However, it seems that it was damaged in the battle at "Kamikake no Omihashira.
They asked me to gather parts to repair it.
Let's head to the "Valley of Machine Ruins" and get the parts.
Tirith and his team contacted the Omnistron's child machine.
It seems to be able to send not only voice but also text. This is amazing.
Tirith seems to be tense because she is Erinze's only escort.
Erlinse also told me that she was sorry.
Until she gets used to it, it would be better for us to give a little to her.
Let's meet up with the girls who have gone ahead of us at Litze in the "Montenol Valley.
When we arrived at Litze, we ran into a pilgrimage group of Buffalians.
There was the girl who had given us a permit to enter the "Mikazake-no-Obashira".
She was Einlein, the "oracle priestess.
We did not know why she had lent us her help. Before we could call out to her, the pilgrim group had gone.
A series of dragon tribe attacks and the appearance of monsters have caused anxiety among the people. Avalithia is one of them.
I hope that liberating Avaritia with Erinze and the others will lead to peace. ......
For now, let's follow the Omnistron's reaction.
Flesh of the Horngoat
Glowing shards
Jag fruit
The Soundless City

It seems that the next avaritia to be liberated is in the "Soundless City" managed by the Order of Buffalia.
Feste is quite enthusiastic about the possibility of finding treasure in the ruins, which are rarely frequented by adventurers.
The story is supposed to be about a world crisis. ......
The next avaritia to be liberated seems to be in the desert.
There is a barrier on the road to the desert. We have to pass through there.
Beyond this point is the Evergreen Desert.
It is the stage for a new adventure.
Omnistron's response is out toward the desert.
First, let's proceed toward the city of Salamzat.
We have come to the Temple of Buffalia in Salamzat to seek information on Avalythia.
The omnistron cannot be used now that the light-colored wind is blowing.
Erinze said that the temple might be able to tell us about Avalithia. ......
We met Charlotte, a diva, at the entrance to the desert.
It seems that the Zilwet Traveling Troupe, to which she belongs, is about to start a performance.
Erinze is looking forward to it, and Einlein wants to see it too.
I also have an appointment with Charlotte. Let's all go see the performance together.
Carveen and Charlotte are going to hide out in a safe house.
Apart from that, Einlein has a favor to ask.
It was something that was difficult to talk about in the temple.
We met up with Erinze and the others and talked about Carveen, Charlotte, Einlein and Jorg.
They said that there was something that was bothering Erlinse and Tirith a little.
They said it was about an old man, but they seemed to be at a loss as to what to say to him.
Elektra seems to have a favor to ask.
Is it something to do with the Buffalian cult?
After crossing the scorching desert, we finally arrived at the Salamzat Oasis.
The best way to relieve the fatigue of the long journey is to eat something sweet.
Tirith decided to serve a cake for Erinze.
Tirith says she has something she wants to finish personally.
I wonder what's going on. ......
Feste, who had a hunch that something interesting was bound to happen, decided to follow her.
Jörg was in trouble.
He had lost a piece of paper that he had tucked into his notebook when he ran away from the insects.
He said it was a personal diary and didn't contain much .......
I need you to find my missing congregation."
Electra's strangely formal request reveals an unknown side of her.
Veronica, Deputy Commander of the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart.
Will the day ever come when her feelings will reach that person in her heart? ......
Avaritia reaction in Omnistron!
But it was not a target to be released.
Should it be defeated or not? ......What decision did Tirith make?
Erinze and Tirith are visiting Asterlys for the first time.
Both of them enjoy a momentary rest, as everything they see is new to them.
Asteria Plain Let's go to the Church Garrison.
Montenol Valley Let's talk with the gatekeeper at the customs gate.

Let's go to Salamzat and talk with Einlein.

Let's talk with Erinze in Salamzart
We defeated Avaritia in "The Soundless City.
When we arrived, a young man was fighting Aberritya first.
Although he struggled, he collapsed and was unable to move.
They decide to carry the young man to a place where he can rest while Erinze performs the liberation ceremony.
The garrison of the Buffalia Order should be nearby. Let's go there.
We have defeated Abaritia of "Fortress of the Dawn Worms.
This is another avaritia that should be liberated. Erlinse steps forward for the liberation ceremony.
At that moment, Abaritia, which should have collapsed, rose up with terrifying vitality.
Then, a figure descended from overhead. With a thrust of her spear, Avaritia sank to the ground.
Dunkerque, the leader of the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart, appeared. He seemed to have been investigating these ruins with his men in tow.
After Dunkerque and his men left, Ehrinse safely liberated Avaritia.
For the time being, let's return to Einlein and tell him not to worry about Avaritia.
On the way home, Tirith was a little slow on her feet, as if something was bothering her. Was something wrong?
Charlotte returned to her troupe mates.
Carveen also left, as he was going to join his friends.
I feel tired after all that has happened.
Let's take a break at the rest stop.
Jorg was the son of Dunkerque, the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Barnhart.
He was a childhood friend of Einlein and Carveine, and they are still close friends.
Yorg is personally investigating something, and Einlein and his friends are helping him with it.
However, he was successfully sidetracked as to the details of his research. Maybe it's something he doesn't want us to know too much about.
Einlein's business is done. Yoruk seemed to remain here and asked me to take Einlein back to Salamzat.
The mysterious old man told him an old story about a priest.
The priest had a woman he admired. Alicia's blessing" were the words she used to say to him.
The priest searched for the "Sandwind Flower" that the woman had asked for. In the process, he was surrounded by a dazzling light and landed in a strange land where people, culture, and everything else was different.
And then, he said, a long month passed.
At the old man's request, Tirith held up a copy of "The Flower of the Sand Wind" and smiled awkwardly. The old man, seeing this, nodded his head in satisfaction.
He then said he would deliver the thank-you gift to the rest stop, and quietly left.
The avaritia of "The Cliff of Whispers" was defeated.
With the light winds subsiding and the omnistrons now available, it was clear that this was the avaritia that needed to be released.
While Feste had Electra's attention, the liberation ceremony was also completed by Erinze.
However, there was suddenly a disturbing shadow.
The dragon king Voldigen appeared, and Elektra also revealed her true form as the dragon tribe Frelbe.
She infiltrated the Buffarian cult under Voldigen's orders. She then monitored Erinze's activation of the bio-engraum through the release of avaritia.
Voldigen's goal is to feed on that Erinze and gain power. Erlinse's condition and whereabouts were all being kept under wraps by Frelbe.
The companions fell helplessly before the overwhelming power of Voldigen.
Erlinse was captured and about to be eaten.
The Imagine Seed given by Carveen shone brightly, and a beautiful singing voice began to flow out.
Voldigen suffered from the singing and flew away into the sky.
Before she had time to catch her breath, Frelbe, who had turned into a giant dragon, attacked her.
After a mortal struggle, she disappeared into the deep valley floor.
She was no longer in sight.
The threat of the dragon tribe had passed.
Feste, Erinze, and Tirith somehow managed to survive.
The young man who had recovered gave his name as Carveen.
He seemed to have been investigating something in the "Soundless City. He seemed to have anticipated Avaritia's presence, but how did he know?
Carveen gave him an Imagine Seed, which he said was his most treasured possession, as a thank-you for helping him.
As soon as I received it, a strange scene flashed in my mind.
Somewhere, a boy was wielding a sword.
Someone was watching over him.
I suddenly realized that Carveen had already left. I'll ask him about the details the next time I see him.
Erlinse and Tirith also joined us after the liberation of Avalithia.
Our next destination was the desert. The next destination was the desert, where "Salamzat" was located.
We were able to pass through the barrier without incident.
Now we can go to Salamzat.
I am looking forward to experiencing a different culture in a different place.
We arrived at Salamzat.
At the same time, there was a glowing wind that disrupted the flow of engrams. The omnistron was temporarily out of service and the whereabouts of Avaritia were unknown.
Then Erinze suggested that they go to the Buffalian temple. At the temple, he said, he might be able to get some information about Avalitia.
Einlein, too, seemed to be concerned about Avalithia.
He was relieved to hear that there was nothing to worry about.
A cheer went up from the plaza. I heard that Charlotte's traveling troupe of entertainers was about to begin their performance.
I have an appointment with Charlotte, and Erinze is leaning forward happily.
It would be good to take a break once in a while.
I had a strange dream.
--I was in a forest, and someone was holding me up.
Unable to move, I heard a voice crying out.
Mother," he cried over and over again.
When I opened my eyes, I found a bag of small money under my pillow.
Then I saw Charlotte's back as she walked away.
Feste had noticed, too, and together they followed Charlotte to the entrance of the city.
Charlotte seemed quite concerned that she had been attacked by an armed group. She was trying to disappear on her own, fearing that her troupe mates might get involved.
Then Carveen and Einlein approached him.
They were friends, and Einlein said that he really wanted to help Charlotte. Furthermore, Carveen was a member of the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart, making him the perfect person to protect Charlotte.
Carveen says he has to go into hiding for some reason. He also offered to shelter Charlotte there.
Charlotte agreed and left the city with Carveen. Now she would not have to worry.
Meanwhile, Einlein asked me to do something for her. I would ask her about it after I settled down.
Back in Salamzat, Electra caught Einlein in an angry mood.
It seemed that Einlein would somehow cover up what had happened to Yoruk. For the time being, this matter would be over.
Erlinse and Tirith must have rested. Let's join them.
A young man who said he was asked by the old man came to the rest area.
I heard that the old man had passed away.
As a thank-you gift, he delivered a commemorative coin of the Buffalo-Brazilian religion. It was quite old, probably from the time of the founder.
There is no way to know for sure what really happened to the old man.
The Flower of the Sand and Wind" shattered in Tirith's hand and vanished.
It was as if it was bidding farewell to the end of a long journey.
It had been a long day.
Many things have happened, and there is too much to think about.
I'm going to rest now.
I'll look for answers later.

Asterleaze: Let's go to the Town Gate Square
Let's go to the market in Asterleaze
Let's go to the "Soundless City" in the "Andorra Basin".
We have arrived at the Soundless City.
We're going to find a treasure and pay off our debt!　Tirith nailed Feste, who was enthusiastic, saying, "Our first priority is to free Avalitia.
Aberritya is in the back.
Let's go for the release of the second avaritia.
At the gate, we were asked to present a guarantor.
This seemed to be a new requirement, as no one knew anything about a guarantor.
It seems that Dunkerque, the leader of the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart, who has political instability, is visiting Salamzat and is therefore on heightened alert.
The condition for a guarantor is that the guarantor must have lived in Asterleaze for at least 10 years.
According to Feste, the owner of the Coin Pavilion has been running the store since before that time, so there is no problem with him as a guarantor.
We have to turn back, but we have no choice.
Let's go to Asterleaze.
The owner of the coin-operated restaurant almost mistook me for a guarantor of his debt.
The owner's eyes became colder and colder as Erinse and Tirith called me a "new servant" and a "senior servant. ......
Anyway, he agreed to be a guarantor with conditions.
My husband has been using an Imagine Seed to contact his brother. It has been broken and he wants to repair it.
He needs a few special materials, so he wants us to collect them.
I was able to collect the materials to repair the Imagine Seed.
Let's deliver them to the owner of the coin-operated pavilion.
The owner of the coin-operated pavilion agreed to be my guarantor.
He also prepared a certificate.
With this, we should be able to pass through the barrier.
Just after entering the desert, we found some travelers who had escaped from monsters.
In order to let them go, he said, the girl had acted as a decoy to attract the monsters.
I immediately went to help them and came across an unusually strong Buffalian priestess. She, too, had heard the story and had come looking for the girl who had taken the bait.
The priestess is taking care of the monsters in the area.
Let's find the girl while we can.
We were able to save the girl who was being chased by the monsters.
She is Charlotte. She is a diva of a troupe of traveling entertainers who are scheduled to perform in Salamzat.
She said she was confident in her foot speed, but she was reckless.
Erinze's eyes lit up when she heard about the traveling performers. Charlotte invited her to the performance and promised to go see it.
Charlotte left with her friends who came to pick her up.
I am glad to hear that she is safe. Let's head for Salamzat, too.
In the temple was Electra, the priestess we had met in the desert.
She is said to be a guard for Einlein, a priestess of the oracle. However, Einlein had wandered off and they were looking for her.
According to Elineze, "the oracle priestess has detailed information about Avalithia.
We decided to help Elektra find Einlein.
Einlein was playing with children behind the settlement office.
He told them a story about a "beast" that once destroyed the world, but it seemed to bore them.
Instead, Feste sang a beautiful song.
The tone of the song attracted not only the children but also Einlein.
While Feste was teaching the song, Electra arrived.
She asked Einlein about Avaritia, who was being brought back to her, and he told her that she was in "Fortress of the Dawn Bugs.
Why did Eälinse think that the oracle priestess knew where Abaritia was?
I did not get a clear answer from her.
Charlotte's stage began amidst cheers.
But it soon turned into screams.
A group of unidentified armed men suddenly attacked her.
Charlotte ran out of town. The armed group also chased after her.
No need to be told by Einlein.
I have to go save Charlotte right away.
The one who protected Charlotte, who was cornered, was Carveen, whom she had met in the "Soundless City.
The two of them worked together to kick out the armed group and save Charlotte.
Tirith, who had rescued the injured, also joined them. The town has regained its calm.
However, Charlotte had no idea that her life had been threatened.
On the way back to Salamzat, Carveen dropped an old button. He says it is a clue left behind by the group that once took his mother.
Carveen may have a complicated story to tell.
Einlein wanted to see his friend in secret, even from Elektra and the others. He wanted to ask for their escort.
Let's take her to the Hermit's Fountain in the Evergreen Desert.
At the Hermit's Fountain, there was no sign of Einlein's friend Jörg.
Instead, his handkerchief, footprints, and the carcass of an insect were left behind.
Yoruk is not very fond of insects, and even the smallest ones make his blood boil. And if he was attacked by a large insect monster, his life might be in danger.
Let's hurry up and look for Yoruk.
The insect monster appeared at the end of Yoruk's footprints.
I wonder if Yoruk is safe.
After defeating the swarming insects, a young man appeared from the shadows.
He was Yoruk. He had escaped from the insects and was safe. To Einlein, who was worried about him, Yoruk seemed to be showing a bit of strength.
It would not do to be attacked by insects again after standing here and talking.
Let's go back to the safety of the tent.
An old man in Salamzat said that he might have been chronoleptic.
If so, we could not leave him alone.
Let's talk to the old man just to be sure.
The old man mumbled "Alicia bless you ......" at the bar.
It is definitely the activation word of the Chronogate.
When the old man saw Tirith, his consciousness suddenly became clear. He was so surprised that he seemed unable to speak.
The old man had asked him to deliver a "Sandwind Flower. Apparently, it was someone's favorite flower.
He promised to tell us everything he knew if we gave it to him.
The "Flower of the Sandwind" is something that the desert winds produce by chance, and we don't even know where it is.
Let's ask Einlein to help us here. The information network of the Buffalia cult might be able to catch something.
I was able to hear from Einlein and Elektra.
A few years ago, "The Flower of the Sandwind" was found at the Boroum Ruins.
I got a copy of "The Flower of the Sandwind" deep in the "Bor-Om Ruins.
The beauty of the flower caught the eyes of Erinze and Tirith. Both of them were so moved that their bodies trembled.
I wonder if that old man also sought this out of beauty.
Let's deliver "The Flower of the Sandwind" to the old man in Salamzat.
Elektra asked me to defeat Abaritia.
Apparently, Abaritia appeared along the pilgrimage route, and they decided that it would be better to defeat it than to go around it.
Einlein heard about the "Fortress of the Dawn Insects" project to defeat Avaltia, and this led to the request.
Feste was also persuaded with the words, "I'll give you a reward.
Anyway, we couldn't leave Avalitia alone.
We should join up with Elektra and head out to defeat Abaritia.
Avalitia had appeared at the "Cliff of Whispers.
Elektra spoke up and said, "Originally, the cult should take responsibility for Avalithia.
She said that the Buffalia cult has sealed Avalithia in a sacred place and has been recovering and using a huge amount of engrams from it.
I could not hide my surprise at the unexpected truth. Elektra immediately minced words, but it was too late.
It seems that Ehrinse also knew about the connection between the Buffalia cult and Avaritia. Come to think of it, Abaritia was also sealed in the Chronogate of the "Shinkake no Gobashira.
After finishing this case of Avaritia, Erinze will tell me what happened.
For now, let's go to the "Cliff of Whispers" and defeat Avaritia.

A future to protect
We have survived intense battles not only with Avaritia, but also with the dragon king Voldigen and the dragon tribe Frelbe.
Now we need some rest.
Erlinse has been taken away to the future by Bashlar.
According to the voice I heard from Imagine Seed, Erinse is going to be used in some "plan.
Erinze's life is in danger.
Let's go to the future with Tirith and rescue Erinse.
Tirith was captured by the avaritia shell, chrono-leaped, and disappeared.
She must be somewhere in this time period.
It seems that Merlouf knows where the Avalitya Shell appears.
In the future he said that he would be in Asterlys if he were in this time period. ......
Avaritia Shell is supposed to be in the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings," an important stronghold of the Buffalian Order.
The only way to get there is to use the transporter in the Temple of Asterlys.
We would have no choice but to ask permission to use it.
I will talk to a high priest in the temple.
There seems to be some kind of request from Lugerio.
There are a lot of things we need to know about what has happened since Avalitia Shell appeared in the temple.
Let's hear what he has to say first.
Jake, who was put in charge of the coin pavilion, struggled with his unfamiliar job.
Feste, who couldn't stand the sight of him, offered to help him out.
Of course, he would receive a reward, but if the coin-operated pavilion went out of business, there would be nothing to be done.
The leader and his wife of the traveling troupe "Gilwet" were worried about Charlotte, whom they had loved like their own child.
In response to their concern, I will try to find a way to get in touch with Charlotte.
Jake, a top adventurer, continues to receive requests.
He is unable to make time to run the Coin Pavilion, so he decides to take on one of the requests on his behalf.
What is it all about?
A demi-dragon appears in the Asteria Plains!
Adventurers are suddenly excited.
Some are snickering, hoping to make a name for themselves.
Others shied away, saying it was too much for them.
But the one who dashed past them was that boy.
Tirith and Erinze were suddenly ordered to return home.
They want to make memories of this era, even if it's just for a short stopover. ......
What is their last wish?
Erinse has inadvertently broken the omnistron.
Now that she cannot rely on Tirith, Feste is at a loss.
But the Princess of Buffalia has undauntedly chosen to take up the challenge.
Let's go to the Evergreen Desert, the Khartoum Ruins.
Let's go to the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings, the Room of Purification.
Let's go to the vicinity of the Two-Faced Coin Pavilion in Asterlys.
Asterleys Plains Let's go to the Minster Hills and look for Merlouf.
Asterleaze, let's go to the Temple of Buffalia
Evergreen Desert, talk with Feste at the Kartoum Ruins
Asterleaze Talk to the Priestess at the Temple
Before returning to the future, Erinse revealed the truth to me.
She is the princess of the Buffalian divine race.
She said that the "gods" who once built an advanced civilization and created humans still live beyond the sky.
They have given instructions to the Bafaria cult through an oracle to retrieve the engram from Avalithia, which is sealed in the holy land.
However, the resulting distortion caused by the avaritia has accumulated and led to the destruction of the planet.
Ehrinse wanted to release this cause and effect and seek a new future.
Even though it was only for a short time, Ehrinse told me that the trip with them had been "fun.
Hearing this, there was a glimmer in Feste's eyes.
At the Chronogate on the top floor, Bashraal was waiting for us.
His face was familiar. It was the man I had seen in my dream - the man who had taken the crying boy's mother away.
Bashraal took one look at me and attacked without saying a word. Tirith was also hit and Erinze was put into a coma.
Bashraal then chrono-leaped, taking only Erinze with him.
When she was left behind, she heard a voice from Imagine Seed.
'Save Erlinse, she is being used for the "Plan."'
The voice did not answer the question. However, we cannot leave Erinze as she is.
The way to the future, Charlotte says, is open to her.
We must hurry to the Khartoum Ruins to meet her.
At the Khartoum Ruins, in addition to Charlotte and Carveen, Einlein and Jorg were also there.
The oracle had come to Einlein and was waiting for her here.
Charlotte followed the oracle and entrusted a pendant to him.
Inside was a chronogram of such high purity that Tirith was surprised. She said that even if all of us did the chronoleap, it would still contain more than enough power.
With this, we would be able to rescue Erlinse.
We thanked Charlotte and the others and headed back to the future from the "Shinkake no Gobashira".
We could see the laboratory where the Avaritia Shell was installed.
Already in the final stage, a black haze began to extend from the avalitia shell to Erinze at Bashlar's signal.
Tirith jumped in and rescued Erinze just in time. However, this time Tirith was caught by the avalitia shell.
An alarm went off, and Bashraal gave instructions, but the movement of Avalitya Shell did not stop.
Unable to reach Tirith's outstretched hand, she was swallowed up by the Avalitia Shell.
The next moment, the Abaritia Shell seemed to glow with a dazzling light, and then vanished without a trace.
According to Bashraal, the Avalitya Shell had jumped from here to 1,000 years ago - to their own time. Moreover, the effect of the jump had disrupted space-time, making it impossible to chronoleap and pursue them.
In the midst of the deadlock, Merlouf arrived with Hrelbe. He understood the whole situation and said, "I will make it possible for you to chronoleap.
Half-convinced, I went to the chronogate and found that the space-time was indeed stable. This would make chronoleaping possible.
Bashlar proposed a cooperative relationship with the goal of capturing Avaritia Shell.
Erlinse seemed emotionally reluctant to nod, but she gave priority to saving Tirith and accepted the proposal. Bashraal's support, including the preparation of the chronogram, was essential to the rescue of Tirith.
Leaving Hrelbe on watch, he and Erlinse went chronoleaping again.
The destination was their own time.
They had to find Avaritia Shell and Tirith, who were supposed to be there.
They interviewed people in town and found Merlouf.
About six months ago, Merlouf sensed an abnormal occurrence of engrams in the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings" under the island of St. Bafaria.
It was probably caused by avaritia shells.
According to Ehrinze, the Avalitia Shell jumps through time and space without using a chronogram. It is thought that this caused the time period to shift and history to move within half a year.
The Cathedral of the Blessed is an important center of the Buffalian religion. The only way to get there is through the temple in Asterleaze.
I don't know if they will allow us to go there, but let's go to the temple anyway.
We found the Avaritia Shell in the innermost part of the Cathedral of Divine Blessings.
Einlein has set up a ward to contain the Avalitia Shell. It will no longer be able to move around on its own.
Tirith is half buried in the avaritia shell, sleeping. They have not yet completely fused.
However, at some point the avaritia shell will wake up and take in Tirith.
Before that happens, we must find a way to separate Tirith.
Otherwise, the world will face a future of destruction.
If there were no way to rescue Tirith--
If we could not avoid a future of destruction--what would we do?
I search for the words to answer Feste's question.
What will I find at the end of this world, this journey?

Let's talk in front of the entrance of the Valley of the Ruins in the Baha Mar Plateau.
Tirith received a call from a man named Bashlar. It seems he was giving Tirith instructions from 1,000 years in the future.
When I reported the Vordigen incident, Bashraal was concerned for Erlinse's safety and gave the order to return to the future.
The liberation of Avaritia was also suspended in order to prioritize Erinze's safety.
Tirith asked me to send the two of them to "Kamikake no Mikabashira" as a "last request".
Once they return to the future, we will never see each other again.
It is sad to say goodbye, but ...... it is inevitable.
I am ready to jump to the future.
Let's head for the Chronogate of "Kamikake no Oyabashira".
Tirith told me about Erinze and Bashlar.
Bashlar and Tirith belong to a thought group called "Zolxia" within the Buffalian Gods. Tirith's original mission was to escort and monitor Erinze.
However, as he got to know Erinze's personality, Tirith was drawn to her and came to serve her wholeheartedly.
Tirith's desire to help Erinze is genuine. I am sure that Erinze knows this.
After the chronoleap, we have finally arrived at the future, 1000 years in the future.
Let's hurry to Erinze.
A thousand years in the future, in the "Kangen no Gobashira," I met again with Frelbe, a dragon tribe member.
She has lost her memory of this time period, and is said to be serving Erinse together with Tirith.
Hrelbe was also on her way to the research facility to save Erinze, who had been kidnapped. When I accompanied her, Hrelbe told me about Bashlar's plan.
It was the "Avaritia Shell Project.
The plan was to fuse Erlinse with a special "Avaritia Shell" to control other Avaritia.
Of course, there were many objections, and in the end it was decided to liberate the avaritia by Erinze.
However, even this was Bashlar's intention. As a result of the release of avalitia and the activation of the biological engram, Erinze had become more easily fused with the avalitia shell.
Even now, the fusion of Erlinse and Avalitia Shell is underway.
We must reach the research facility as soon as possible and stop the plan.
We reached the first floor of the "Shinken no Mihashira. However, the entrance to the research facility was closed.
Then, Bashraal's image was projected on the screen.
Bashraal is only trying to proceed with the Avalitya Shell project. It was not to control Avalitya.
The real purpose is to destroy an overdeveloped civilization, the "Beast of the Planet.
The whole point of the Avalitya Shell project was to control the beast, which is not a fairy tale but a real thing in the imaginary world.
Bashlar tells Erinze that the sacrifice of one person is unavoidable in order to protect the planet and civilization. However, Tirith does not accept this and clearly states that she wants to save Erinse.
The soldiers sent by Bashraal are taken care of by Hrelbe. He says that the research facility can be reached by following the tracks where she once went on a rampage.
We are one step closer to helping Erinse.
There seemed to be no noticeable change in Aelinse.
It seems like a lie that we went to the future.
Let's go to the Coin Pavilion to gather information.
When I arrived at Coin-tei, the owner was just about to leave.
Jake is taking care of his absence, but I heard that there was talk of closing the restaurant for a while. I asked him about it, and he replied that he had heard from Jake that he was going to close the restaurant for a while.
When I inquired about it, Jake told me a surprising story.
King Barnhart was assassinated during an attack by the dragon tribe. Moreover, the main culprit was Carveen, for whom a wanted list had even been issued.
The king was supposedly recovering from an illness. It is not true that he was assassinated during the attack by the dragon tribe, and of course, Carveine would never have assassinated him.
However, there is a discrepancy with the history we know.
After all, there may have been some influence by the avaritia shell.
We should immediately seek out Merlouf and ask him about the whereabouts of the Avalitia Shell.
At the temple, the chief priest, Lugerio, was waiting for us.
He easily gave us permission to use the transporter and told us to go to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings.
Einlein had received the oracle, and the Buffarian Order was willing to cooperate fully.
I heard that Einlein is also in the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings. Let's go there and ask him about the details.
At the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings," Einlein had set up a ward.
He said it was to put to sleep the "angel of God" who appeared half a year ago.
The wards should have been placed closer to the angel, but the monster inside is blocking the angel from approaching.
The oracle Einlein had received was to "eliminate the monster and suppress the angel's anger. Hearing this, Ehrinse guessed that Bashlar had given instructions to the Order in the form of an oracle.
In any case, there is no doubt that Tirith and Avaritia Shell are here.
In order to help Tirith, we need to go to the innermost part.

The avaricious shell that has taken in Tirith has been temporarily stabilized by Einlein's warding.
We must find a way to draw Tirith away while we still can.
Tirith is asleep and seems to be doing fine for now.
Einlein is by her side, watching over her.
This Einlein, however, seems to be concerned about Carveen and Charlotte, who are at the safe house.
Above all, they must rescue Einlein first.
However, it is difficult to get help from the confused Order.
We will have to infiltrate the Duchy of Barnhardt ourselves.
The owner of the Coin Pavilion gave us the route to Barnhart Castle.
Is this information reliable?
If it is correct, we can move forward at once to rescue Carveen and Einlein. ......
Finally, we have the means to get to Barnhardt Castle.
The goal is the "Old Underground Canal of Barnhart Castle.
We should be able to get into the castle under the watchful eye of the Knights.
In order to clear Carveen and Einlein of suspicion and put the whole situation behind us, we need to talk to Dunkirk.
Let's head for Dunkirk's office.
Dunkirk is said to be at the "Dorava Royal Institute.
He says he has the truth about Carveine there.
The temple is noisy.
Erlinse is talking with a priest with a serious face.
It seems that the declaration of war by the Duchy of Barnhart against the Order is not the only reason.
Carveen had been entrusted by King Norbert to organize the documents and other materials left at the Dorava Royal Institute.
It didn't seem like a big job, but his expression was heavy.
What in the world was going on ......?
The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the two of them have been in the same room together for a long time.
In order to do so, she really needed to meet Carveine.
Let's escort her to Barnhart Castle.
I saw Carveen with an unflattering face.
He is now hailed as a "hero" who saved the country from a crisis, but why is he here?
An old friend of the owner came to visit him at the Coin Pavilion.
Without being asked, he began to tell an old story.
Together with Feste, who showed a rare interest in the story, let's find out the unknown past of the owner of Coin-tei.
Charlotte heard a rumor of a bandit who attacked only traveling entertainers.
Intuiting that it was the same armed group that had targeted her, she took action on her own.
She received a letter from Einlein.
The sender is Carveen and the addressee is Charlotte.
...... I thought it was a casual, mundane errand!
Let's talk to Asterries Lugerio.

I released the avaritia in "The Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon".
It does not lead directly to the rescue of Tirith, but if left unchecked, it would have had a negative impact on the future.
This information about Avaritia was conveyed to us by Bashraal.
He was originally opposed to the liberation of Avaritia. Nevertheless, this time, he proposed to liberate it.
Is it because the future situation is that bad? ......
Erlinse is worn out by the liberation ceremony.
Let's go back to Litze and let Erlinse rest.
After all, it seems that something strange is happening in connection with the cult.
Anyway, let's head for the temple.
I informed Bashlar that I had liberated Avaritia.
It seems that the problem at hand has been averted. But the future of ...... destruction was closer than I had imagined.
According to Bashraal, the future could no longer be observed.
The fusion of Avaritia Shell and Tirith had brought the world to a point where it could be destroyed at any moment.
Bashraal also attempted to alter the past by chronoleaping, but it ended in failure as well as causing a great number of casualties.
The only way now is to somehow get Tirith away from the avaricious shell.
Let's go back to check on Tirith.
Lugerio told me a shocking story.
The Duchy of Barnhart declared war on the Order of Buffalia and raided the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings.
The Duchy claims that the Order is a heretical and dangerous group that has been using Avaritia to further pull strings in the assassination of the Duke.
They also said that even Einlein had been taken away from the assassin, Carvein, for having guided him.
The wards that encircle the Avaritia Shell have lost their power. The "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings" was sealed off, and Tirith could not be reached.
At this rate, it is only a matter of time before Tirith is taken in by the Avalitha Shell and faces a future of destruction!
While we were canvassing in Kanaroa, we saw a hooded woman standing in the harbor.
She held up her hand and a strange scene flashed in my mind.
A scene of a terrible battle and a dying world.
She heard one word in the midst of it all: "You can change the future.
You can change the future.
When he came to, the woman was nowhere to be found.
Then Feste arrived with a letter.
It was from the owner of Coin-tei. The letter contained information on how to get into Barnhart Castle.
How the owner knew such information, I don't know.
But for now, that is the only clue we have.
As the letter from the owner said, I got the key at the "Alston Ruins.
With this, we should be able to sneak into Barnhart Castle through the underground canal.
However, the Barnharte Knights are on high alert. Charlotte then proposed a diversionary tactic.
Charlotte and Jake would act as decoys to attract the Knights, and in the meantime rescue Carveen and the others.
With Jake, they would be safe and the diversion would work.
From here, they split up.
We will do our best to rescue Carvain and Einlein.
After breaking through the old underground canal and passing through a hidden door, we found ourselves in a prison.
We succeeded in knocking out the guards and freeing Carveen and Einlein.
For the time being, both of them seemed to be safe.
However - tragedy had occurred in their unknown history.
Their best friend, Yoruk, had died two months earlier. Yoruk was unable to do anything about the crisis Carvain and his friends were in.
The young man who prayed for them said, "May God bless you in your fight.
The young man who prayed for him has disappeared into the altered history. ......
When I tried to escape from Barnhart Castle, Carveen wanted to talk to Dunkirk.
If we just ran away, nothing would be solved. Besides, if Dunkerque had lost his way, the only one who could stop him now that Jorg was gone was Carveen, whom he treated like a son.
Carveen's eyes held a firm resolve.
Standing in the courtyard was Deputy Commander Veronica.
She is also known as Dunkirk's right-hand woman, and she regarded us as a complete enemy.
Everything was for Dunkirk.
With this single-minded determination, Veronica continued to wield her sword until she ran out of strength.
Just before she lost consciousness, a mysterious word spilled out of Veronica's mouth.
The blood of Carveine killed Yoruk and drove Dunkirk mad.
I don't know what it meant, but the ominous sound lingered in my ears.
Erinse was waiting for me at the temple in Asterlys.
According to her, the future situation was looking up. The death of Dunkirk was one of the keys to avoiding destruction.
When we went to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings," Einlein had reestablished the wards, and the Avalitia Shell had finally regained stability.
Not only that, but Tirith responded to our call!
She did indeed speak, "...... ahead, Pai ......."
We could faintly see a way to rescue Tirith.

On the other hand, a bloated Avalithia was confirmed again, perhaps due to the appearance of the Avalithia Shell.
It seems that the avaritia appearing in "The Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon" must be freed by the power of Eirinse.
According to Einlein, they have lost contact with Carvein and his group.
He said that their hideout is in the "Sandstone Corridor of Khartoum" near the Khartoum Ruins.
Let's make sure they are safe and reassure Einlein.
The Barnhardt Knights were at the hideout.
They seemed to have come to capture Carveen and attacked us as well, but we managed to return fire.
Carveen and Charlotte seemed to have sensed it in advance and fled. They were not in the hiding place.
As they were leaving, the Knights of Barnhart mentioned something that bothered them.
'I could have gone on a clean rampage if I'd just played with the cultists.' ......
Was there something going on between them and the Buffalian Order?
The air in Asterlys is a bit hectic.
First, I decided to talk to the people in town.
The only way to get to the Duchy of Barnhart is by sea.
For that, we would need a ship.
However, I wondered if there would be a ship that would be willing to secretly transport us to ourselves under the circumstances. ......
Jake is the best person to talk to about this kind of thing.
Let's visit Jake at the Coin Pavilion.
I left Erinze at the temple and went to the Coin Pavilion.
To my surprise, Charlotte was there.
The two of them had sensed the movement of the Barnhardt Knights and had escaped from their hideout at the Khartoum ruins in the nick of time.
Carveen went straight to Einlein's rescue alone.
Charlotte was told to go into hiding, but she couldn't stand still and consulted with the Pioneering Bureau, where she was introduced to Jake.
I want to save Carveine and Einlein.
Charlotte's sincere wish moved Jake.
He prepared a ship bound for the Duchy of Barnhart, and Jake himself accompanied her. He also offered to take two more people on board.
He was indeed a top of the line adventurer. We could count on him.
We would meet up with Jake and the others at the port of Asterleaze.
Thanks to Jake, the boat is ready.
However, it seems that we can't gather enough crew.
We have limited time, and it will be faster if we find them ourselves.
We should go to the city of Asterleaze and look for people who would be willing to take the boat.
We found a group of people who were willing to serve as the ship's crew.
We can't afford the luxury of a hodgepodge.
Now we can head for the Duchy of Barnhart.
I'll let Jake know.
Now it's time to set sail!
We arrived at "Kanaroa," a fishing village on the West Barnhart Peninsula.
There, the date of Carveine and Einlein's execution was prominently posted.
It seems that they are being held in the castle's prison.
I was concerned about their situation.
I would like to go to their aid immediately, but I am up against the valiant and well-known Barnhardt Knights.
We have no chance of winning even if we go in head-on.
First, let's hear from the people of Canaroa and plan a strategy.
Barnhart Castle has an "old underground canal" that leads to the interior.
It is already closed, but the key to it is said to be hidden in a cave called "Alston's Abandoned Anti-Anti".
The contents of the letter are detailed, and I can find no reason to bother lying.
We trust the owner and head for the "Alston Abandoned Waterway.
On the way to the "Alston Abandoned Caves," we came across the Barnhardt Knights.
Just when we were thinking of forcing our way through, a dragon tribe named Leanbrum flew in from the sky above us.
Leenblum's tone sounded as if the dragon tribe and the Barnhardt Knights were in a cooperative relationship and the Knights were following the dragon tribe.
Then, for arguing with his orders, Leenblum spat out a deadly poison and flew away, taking the lives of the Knights. ......
What on earth is going on in the Duchy of Barnhart?
The key to the "Alston Abolition" must be obtained as soon as possible to find out what is really going on.
Dunkirk was at the far end of the "Dorava Royal Laboratory.
He was standing calmly, as if he knew we were coming.
Carveine was not the assassin of the king.
Dunkerque himself admitted that. He then said that Carveen and Einlein must die, and summoned a deformed monster to the spot.
The changed figure was - Yoruk.
It was the figure of his beloved son, who had been transformed into Avalithia by a part of the Buffarian cult and whom Dunkirk had defeated without knowing it.
After a fierce battle, Dunkerque fell to his knees.
Carveine asks him the truth. Dunkerque did not answer, but pointed to the dagger that had belonged to Carveen's mother.
If only I didn't have it, I wouldn't hate you. ......
As soon as he said this, Dunkirk grabbed the dagger and slit his own throat.
In a drenching bloodbath, the mightiest of mankind's knights sank into an unspeakable despair and unspeakable rage.
When I left the "Dorava Royal Institute," I found Veronica standing there, having regained consciousness.
She told me the whole story of how Dunkirk had taken Jorg in his hands.
Some members of the Buffarian cult were trying to create an artificial "pseudo-avaritia.
Originally, it was not possible to create it, but with the appearance of the avaritia shell, the research progressed and Yoruk became a victim.
After defeating it and learning the truth, Dunkerque exploded in anger against the cult and the Buffalian god race.
Another reason that drove Dunkirk to despair.
It was Carveine's dagger.
The dagger, a memento of his mother's, belonged to the Buffalians.
Carveine had the blood of the Buffalian gods.
Veronica laughed out of the ordinary as she revealed this shocking fact.
The dragon tribe Leanbrum had taken her form.
They had eaten Veronica and taken her form and memories.
Leanbrum flew away, leaving Carveen in a rage.
The inescapable truth weighed heavily on his mind.
Is it true what Leanbrum said?
Let's go check where Veronica was.
The man in the courtyard was the owner of the Coin Pavilion.
At the same time, it was also Prince Norbert of the Duchy of Barnhart.
The owner and the king were the same person.
The series of events were settled by King Norbert as a rebellion by Dunkirk, who was plotting to usurp the throne.
The truth of the matter is complicated.
However, it was the decision of the Duchy of Barnhart that it was not possible for the Duchy of Barnhart to worsen relations with the Buffarian cult in this confusing situation.
To Carveine, who was not convinced, Prince Norbert said, "Someday, history will reveal the truth.
Now that he was the duke, the husband could no longer return to the coin-operated pavilion.
Feste's debt was wiped out by this achievement.
However, Feste looked somewhat lonely.
I met up with Charlotte and Jake in Kanaloa.
They both knew that the case was closed. Jake praised me for my work.
I returned the pendant to Charlotte, which she had left unborrowed.
She had been wondering about it, too, and seemed relieved when she picked it up.
We returned to Asterlys and parted ways with Jake and the others.
I left the coin pavilion in Jake's hands again. I told him that the owner would not be able to return for a while.
......Wouldn't it be nice to have a place to go back to?" Feste murmured quietly.
At the same time, a ceremony was held at Barnhart Castle to honor Carvain's achievements.
It seems that Carveen was personally honored by King Norbert and became known as a hero of the salvation of the country.

The events surrounding the Duchy of Barnhart have been settled, and the state of Avaritia Shell and Tirith has stabilized for the time being.
However, it cannot remain this way forever.
We must think of a way to rescue Tirith.
In order to jump back to the past again, we have to get the chronogram somehow.
Where can we find a clue?
Let's talk to our friends first.
We need three "Star Spirit Divas" to hold the Star Spirit Festival.
One of them will be Charlotte.
Let's find the remaining two.
There is only one "Star Spirit Diva" left.
Let's hold the Star Spirit Festival and proceed with the rescue of Tirith.
Preparations have begun for the Star Festival, the largest festival of the Buffalian faith.
If there is anything you can do to help, lend a helping hand.
The attack on the Star Festival has been resolved, but this is not the end of the matter.
We are also concerned about the future movements of the armed group and their background.
The request was for a fee that was disproportionately high.
Even Feste was suspicious.
There may be some kind of secret to be kept.
As adventurers, we couldn't just overlook it.
I want you to kill the monsters that are destroying our village," said Feste.
It is a common request, but the situation seems urgent.
Apparently, the monster attacks have suddenly become more intense. ......
Lugerio's worries were endless.
This time, a "fake oracle priestess" had appeared!
This is a serious situation that the Order cannot afford to neglect.
Let's first go out to investigate on his behalf.
The "singing class" sponsored by the Order had been suspended for a while.
Thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of Lalaforte, who is the instructor of the class, the class has finally been resumed.
The rest of the time, we were all scattered.
All that remains is to deliver this good news to the scattered students.
The Seirei Festival was held with great enthusiasm.
The Hoshirei Festival ended with great enthusiasm.
However, Einlein was hardly seen at all, which led to speculation.
What could be done for those who adored her?
Wahlkin was depressed.
His beloved pupil Myrlene's success as a diva had made him lose his passion for archaeology.
I thought I had lost it. ......
Merlouf appears!
I forget how many times this has happened, but he is a godforsaken boy anyway.
This time he's looking for something. ......
Let's talk to Asterlyse Charlotte.
Asterlys, let's talk to Myrlene.
Asterlys, let's go to the temple and talk to Lugerio.

Just as they were about to destroy the Chronogate, the armed group that attacked Charlotte in Salamzart appeared.
She manages to fight them off, but is caught off guard by a man who appears to be the leader of the group and is blown to the center of the Chronogate.
Then, the man muttered, "Alicia bless you.
Alicia bless you.
The Chronogate reacted to the keywords and executed a chrono-leap.
The time he arrived at was far in the future.
It was a future of destruction where all civilizations were overrun by the awakened "Beast of the Planet. ......
The destruction extends to "Kamikake-no-Mihashira" and violent tremors strike.
At that moment, a woman shouted, "Run! A woman shouted, "Run!
There she was, the mysterious woman wearing a hood whom she had met in Kanaloa.
Erinze quickly activated the chronogate and somehow managed to escape the situation.
An unidentified armed group. The leader of the group, the man who activated the chronogate. A future of destruction awaiting them. The mysterious woman ...... who helped him escape from there.
An attempt to return to the past and rescue Tirith ended in failure.
The destruction of the world will eventually come, and it is inevitable as it is now.
As if to indicate the hopeless situation, the high purity chronogram, which had reached its limit, shattered, and no further chrono-leaps were possible.
I feel heavy, but I must return the pendant to Charlotte.
It seems that Lugerio is in charge of all the offerings made at the Star Festival.
I heard that there had just been a discussion among the priests at the temple in Asterleaze.
Let's go talk to Lugerio and see if we can get some offerings from him.
I made the medicine and Lalaforte is now able to speak as she used to.
Her singing voice sounded beautiful and spontaneous, as expected of a "star spirit diva.
Lalaforte, who has regained her natural brightness, already seems fully motivated for the Hoshirei Festival.
Now we have found our second "Star Spirit Diva.
Let's go back to Einlein to report.
As we left the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins," we received a message from Erinze.
While checking on Tillis, Erinse herself had started a part-time job at a coin-operated pavilion.
This may be an expression of Erinse's determination to be as independent as possible.
Myrlene is said to have returned to the temple in Asterleaze.
Once the metal plate is delivered, the third diva will be born.
The final part of the Star Spirit Festival, the celebration by the "Star Spirit Divas," had begun.
A solemn chanting flowed, and the theater was filled with a mysterious atmosphere.
--Then, the stage took a sudden turn!
Amidst the glittering music and lights, the three divas changed into spectacular stage costumes and began to sing.
Charlotte and her friends had planned to enliven the Seiryoku Festival stage in this way.
The audience went wild and the theater was filled with cheers.
In the midst of all this, a group of armed men snuck into the back of the theater, aiming for Charlotte's life.
However, Carveine was there and the armed group was repelled.
At the same time, there was also an attack on the temple in Asterlys, but Feste's hunch was right and he was able to wait and repel the attackers.
Thus, the Star Spirit Festival came to a successful conclusion amid unprecedented excitement.
I returned the pendant to Charlotte.
Charlotte seemed shocked when I told her that I had lost the contents of the pendant.
However, she hid it from us and worried for our safety.
My heart aches .......
The only offerings left in the Buffalia Order were a few shards, not enough for a very chronolithic amount.
Moreover, they are going to cancel this year's Star Festival.
Due to the attack by the Duchy of Barnhart, it was no longer possible to prepare the three "Star Spirit Divas," the key elements of the ceremony.
Charlotte heard about this and ran for the position of diva.
And in response to her singing, the offerings lit up.
To my surprise, it seems that Charlotte has the special qualifications needed to be a "Star Spirit Diva.
If we find the remaining two, we can hold the Star Spirit Festival as usual.
We should also be able to make a chronogram.
We safely delivered Lalaforte to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings.
After the greeting, Lalaforte asked Einlein to hear the results of her singing practice.
Einlein began to sing a lullaby that Feste had taught her sometime ago in a faltering voice.
Her voice was not very good, but Charlotte, who was listening to her singing, suddenly burst into tears.
For some reason, the song made Charlotte feel an irresistible sense of nostalgia.
Even Tillis responded to the singing and shed tears as well.
Feste continued to sing, but there was no further reaction.
Was it due to the singing or not?
It is not clear, but it seems certain that Tirith's consciousness is emerging.
I delivered a metal plate to Myrlene.
On it was inscribed a song that had been handed down in ancient times, long before the civilization of Buffalia.
Myrlene reproduced a lullaby that Feste had sung in Salamzat and taught to Einlein.
It was a verse that included the rest of the song.
Myrlene wanted to know the details of the song.
However, Feste did not know the details either, and in fact, did not even seem to know why she remembered the song.
I felt sorry for Myrlene, but there was no way to tell her what she didn't know.
In any case, the three "Star Spirit Singers" were all here.
Now we can hold the Star Spirit Festival.
The Star Festival was over, and the town and the temple returned to their normal routine.
Lugerio was relieved to see that the festival was over.
However, he did not expect such a big fuss, and it seems that his headache has increased. ......
As for the offerings to the gods, the chronograms, the refining has begun.
The "Diva of the Star Spirits" sings in a special room, which is said to be in the back of the Temple of Asterlys.
Perhaps those who attacked the temple were aiming there.
But there is no way that an unrelated person could have known of the room's existence.
Who were those armed men?
The "Temple of Heaven's Blessing" was in serious trouble.
The condition of the avaritas shell was deteriorating rapidly, and Tirith was in agony.
The power of Einlein's warding was out of reach.
When it was about to go out of control, the black Imagine Seed emitted a glow that restrained Avalitya Shell.
Then the words spilled from its mouth. "Car ...... ve, in ......?" And.
The next moment, Avalitya Shell disappeared without a trace, leaving behind an intense light--
In his stupor, Merlouf now appears.
Perhaps some special power was used, and everyone's movements were blocked by Merlouf.
Just when they thought they were about to be engulfed by a mysterious light, the Imagine Seed shined again, repelling Merlouf's power.
Merlouf, alone and satisfied, said, "Find the Avaritia Shell," and left.
In the empty void of the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings, Erinse's voice echoed hollowly as she called out to Tirith, "Asterise, I need to talk to Carvain.
Asterleaze, let's talk to Carveen.
Asterleaze, let's talk to Erinze.

Erinze made a bold proposal to rescue Tirith.
He wanted to use chronoleap to jump back in time and destroy the Chronogate before Bashlar arrived in this era.
In this way, Erinze would not be taken away, and Tirith and Avaritia Shell would not merge.
Erlinse will not be able to return to the future, but she is prepared for that too.
If she's willing to go that far, I can't leave her alone.
Feste smiled wickedly at Erlinse, who wanted to do everything on her own.
What about the chronogram?　We have a plan for you," he said.
Charlotte's pendant still contains a high-purity chronogram.
If we use it, we should all be able to jump back in time.
Carveen came to visit Charlotte.
The two were comparing their pendants.
One was a clue from Charlotte's parents, and the other was a prize given to Carveen by Norbert the Duke.
The two pendants looked so much alike that it was hard to believe they were the same.
However, the one Carveen received was made especially for him as an achievement for the Dunkirk incident.
It should not be in Charlotte's hands. ......
The mystery remains, but the priority now is to jump to the past.
I borrowed a pendant and a high-purity chronogram from Charlotte.
While looking up at the Gobashira, Erlinse was a bit sentimental.
He could save Tirith by destroying the Chronogate, but he would never be able to return to this time period and see Tirith again.
Nevertheless, Erinze chose to save Tirith.
The Chronogate is still in operation on the top floor of the Gobashira.
Erinse's resolve is unwavering.
The "Star Festival," the greatest festival of the Buffalian religion, is approaching.
According to Ehrinse, the true purpose of the Star Festival is to create "offerings to the gods.
That offering is the chronogram.
The Buffarian cult may have chronograms in storage to offer to the Buffarian gods.
When I tried to visit Einlein immediately, Carveen and Charlotte said they would go with me.
If they went to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings," the existence of Tirith and Avaritia Shell would be known.
However, Erinze chose to tell them the truth.
To protect Einlein and to protect Tirith, it is better to have a trusted collaborator.
Let's go to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings" and tell them the truth.
Tirith's condition was worsening at the Cathedral of Divine Blessings!
It seems that some time ago, signs of awakening appeared in the avaritia shell.
Einlein took care of it immediately, but Tirith remains in a distressed state. ......
Carveen and Charlotte are speechless in front of the avaritia shell.
Erinse activated a device in the cathedral and began to recount the events of the past.
About the Buffarian Gods, about the chronoleaps, about Tirith and Avalitya Shell, about the future of perdition - and so on.
Carveen and the others were indeed confused by the story, which was so far removed from reality.
However, in the end, they promised to believe in us and lend us their help.
Elinee felt a little relieved to have one of her fears lifted from her chest.
One of the candidates for the "Star Spirit Diva" was Lalaforte, a priestess who had also fulfilled this role last time.
She has a throat injury and is recuperating in her hometown.
Ralaforte, who has the blood of the People of the Forest, has a homeland on the outer continent, beyond the sea. She should be at Cape Lawehara, the gateway to the continent.
Charlotte and Carveen will accompany her to the outer continent, while Lugerio will search for the third "Star Spirit Diva.
Erinse is remaining at the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings" to keep an eye on Tirith.
First, let's take a liner to Cape Lawehala.
When we arrived at Cape Lawehala, we received a message from Erinze.
There seemed to be no change in Tirith's condition. Erinze seems to be being taken care of at the temple in Asterleaze.
Erinse seems to be talking and interacting with the people around her in her own way, but she also seems to be in some kind of danger. ......
It would be better to find Lalaforte and return home as soon as possible.
On the other hand, Carveen also seems to be out of his mind.
At Cape Lawehara, I met Hugo, a high civil official of the Principality of Barnhart.
He said he was here on a work inspection, but when I saw him, he was apparently picking up women .......
Carveine, it seems, is also having a hard time with Hugo's uninhibitedness.
Just as I was about to begin my sermon, Hugo ran off to talk to another woman.
Although elusive, Hugo is said to be brilliant and knowledgeable about a variety of situations.
He might know something about Lalaforte.
Perhaps because he had talked to so many women, Hugo also knew about Lalaforte.
A woman of the blood of the forest people is said to be living in a hermitage outside the village.
Perhaps that was Lalaforte.
When Hugo heard that Charlotte was going to serve as the "Star Spirit Diva" and conduct the Star Spirit Festival, he suddenly became motivated and left.
Let's meet Lalaforte first.
I found Lalaforte and was able to talk to her.
She had been unable to enter her home township and her throat had not been successfully treated.
In a muffled voice, she told me the name of a material called "slime moss" that can be found in the "Valley of the Coral Rocks.
With this, he said, he could make a medicine that was handed down in his hometown.
On behalf of Lalaforte, I went to collect the material.
We successfully obtained "slimy moss.
It smells and feels terrible, and I don't think it will help your throat. ......
Carveen was seriously considering giving it to Einlein as a souvenir if it would help her sing better.
The exchange from there apparently put Charlotte in a bad mood.
I'm sorry to hear that, but I'll follow up later.
First, let's deliver "Numeric Moss" to Lalaforte.
The third diva candidate has already been found.
Lugerio is on his way to Minsterhorn to meet her.
We immediately went after him, but Charlotte was captured by Lalaforte.
She was caught by Lalaforte, because as the "Diva of the Star Spirits," she had to learn the customs of the Order.
She had no choice but to leave the rest of the work to Lalaforte.
I left the rest to her and decided to visit the third diva candidate.
The third diva candidate was Myrlene, a historian.
She seemed to be qualified as well, and a piece of chronogram glowed in response to her singing voice.
When I asked her to take on the role of "Star Spirit Diva," Myrlene offered one condition.
She wants me to retrieve the metal plates she found at the "Tower Rock Mine Site.
Lugerio also said that he would turn a blind eye to the legacy if it was not a problem.
Let's get this over with quickly.
During the Star Festival, Asterlys attracts many tourists from all over the world, and people come and go.
Some of them might even be bad guys mixed in.
This would be the perfect opportunity for armed groups to target Charlotte.
The Order's guards, the dispatched Barnhardt Knights, and Carveen are also on guard.
It would be a good idea for us to make the rounds of the city from time to time.
In the midst of the bustle of the Star Festival, I visited the Coin Pavilion.
There, Erinze, a new waitress, was struggling and had just broken a plate ...... in a big way.
Jake had hired her, but she was having a hard time.
Then Hugo, a high civil official of the Duchy of Barnhart, interrupted them.
Hugo was staying in Asterleaze because he was receiving support from the Duchy of Barnhart.
I got rid of Hugo, who was talking nonsense, and went back to the temple with Erlinse.
Let's go check on Charlotte and the others.
The success of the Star Spirit Festival rests on the shoulders of the "Star Spirit Diva.
Charlotte, Lalaforte, and Myrlene were discussing the stage at the temple.
Although some words sounded like they were planning something, the divas seemed to be full of motivation.
Charlotte was especially enthusiastic.
I am sure they will give us a wonderful stage.
It is our role to protect them.
Lugerio is also busy running around for the climax of the Star Festival.
I heard that Carveen is in charge of the security.
He is at the entrance of the theater, so let's go talk to him.
I met up with Carveen and confirmed the situation.
The theater where Charlotte and her friends are performing is fully secured. Carveen is also supposed to be in charge here.
However, Feste expressed concern that the security might be too concentrated in one place.
While the "Star Spirit Diva" sings, the priests will gather in the theater and the temple will be less crowded.
A shrewd person might take advantage of this.
We, who can move freely, should fortify the temple's defenses here.
The Star Festival will soon reach its climax.
Whoever appears, we must not let them interfere.
It seems that Carveen has captured one of the militants.
They are interrogating him in the basement of the temple.
We may learn something about who they are and who is behind this.
The militant died during the interrogation.
He was poisoned. ......
It doesn't sound like he kept his mouth shut himself. It is likely that someone was trying to keep him from talking.
Someone more nefarious than we can imagine may be in the dark.
Let's meet up with our friends and sort out the information.
Lalaforte explained the poison used.
This is called "grisonia grass," and it is a deadly poison that can only be found in Cape Rawehara.
Only the locals know about it and it is not distributed. Furthermore, he said, it must be processed and used while it is fresh.
In other words, it is believed that there is a hideout of an armed group near the Cape Rawehara colony.
All we need to do now is to actually check the site.
Charlotte wanted to accompany us to Cape Lawehala.
Charlotte was the one whose life was originally threatened. I understand her desire to know the identity of the armed group.
Carveen is also coming with us as an escort.
Somewhere out of sight, I feel an even deeper darkness seething .......
Let's head to Cape Lawehala and uncover the identity of the armed group.
When we arrived at the Grisonia grass colony, Carveen looked around.
He must have tilted his head and said he had seen Cape Lawehala before.
At that moment, the Imagine Seed Carveen had given me glowed, and a strange scene flashed in my mind.
--a woman called Adelaide.
In her arms was a newborn baby.
She whispered the baby's name in a calm voice.
'Carveine' and--"
As I told her this, a voice called out from the shadows.
Standing there was Hugo.
It was the same man who had chrono-leaped them into a future of perdition in the past "Kamikake no Gobashira!
Hugo smiled wanly and disappeared.
He must have had something to do with the armed group.
We must go after him and find out the truth.
Hugo called himself "The Beast Apostle.
The "Beast of the Planet," as told in fairy tales, once destroyed all civilizations. He was created by the beast and follows it.
His goal is to kill Charlotte.
She is the leader of the "Front for Survival," an organization that opposes the "Beast of the Planet" 2,000 years in the future.
Charlotte was born 2,000 years in the future.
Her parents, concerned for her safety, let her go back in time as a baby. The chronogram contained in the pendant was used at that time.
Hugo, on the other hand, also came to the past through chronoleaping.
Hugo, on the other hand, came to the past by chronoleaping in order to kill the baby, Charlotte, without fail.
However, Hugo's plan was thwarted by a close associate of the future Charlotte.
It was Adelaide, a female warrior of the Buffalian god tribe.
Carveine's mother was also a person from the doomed future.
Hugo, while relentlessly targeting Charlotte, also conspired in the Principality of Barnhart.
In order to eliminate the Buffarian cult, he turned Yorke into a pseudo-avaritian experiment and set Dunkirk on a murderous rampage.
All for the sake of "The Beast of the Planet.
Hugo continues to flee, treating his men like pawns.
Hugo escaped into a cave that opened up on the beach.
There is a strong possibility that something is also planted deep inside the cave.
We must follow Hugo without losing our nerve.
According to Hugo, the current avaritia shells are prone to run amok, which is one of the factors hastening the awakening of the "Beast of the Planet.
On the other hand, if we chrono-leap to save Tirith, that will also stimulate the beast.
Either way, they say, it is a dead end.
But that is no reason to abandon Tirith.
We must settle with Hugo here in order to find new possibilities.
After a fierce battle, we managed to defeat Hugo, who had revealed his true nature as a beast apostle and transformed into a deformed form.
However, Hugo continued to struggle.
He escaped to an abandoned and forgotten chronogate.
Hugo forcefully activated the Chronogate and disappeared into the torrent of engrams.
He left behind words of curse for Charlotte and the humans at .......
Could it be that Hugo's purpose was to awaken the planetary beast through the Avalitya Shell?
If so, there is a strong possibility that something abnormal will happen to the Avaritia Shell.
We must return to the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings and check on Tirith!
Where is the Avalitia Shell?
Koaniani Forest
Queen of the Forest
The Mysterious Avalithia
The Queen's True Meaning
Mother and Child
Gift from God
Bond of the Forest
Dragon Chaser
Pathway to the Future
The Avaritia Shell has disappeared from the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings".
This seems to have been caused by Hugo feeding his own existence into the shell, causing it to run amok.
Although the search continues, the whereabouts of the Avaritia Shell are still unknown.
The Avaritia Shell is in the "Koaniani Forest" on the outer continent.
Or, we may be able to find a clue to it.
We must get there as soon as possible before the dragon tribe takes it away from us.
To enter "Ullau Township," we must undergo a ritual called the "Baptism of the Forest," which has been handed down from generation to generation by the forest people.
What is waiting for us?
It seems that Kapaq intends to approach Avaritia Shell, the divine spirit in the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits," without the queen's permission.
The surest way now would be to join Kapakuk's plan.
The Divine Spirit, the mysterious Avaritia, and the dragon tribe Erniges.
With Queen Pipimarca as their enemy, the situation is only getting worse.
Is there any way out of this?
The mysterious Avaritia is Queen Pipimarca's daughter, Lulmana, and behind her lies a sad past between mother and daughter.
At the very least, let's use Erinze's power to free Lulumana's soul and bring her peace of mind.
Einlein seems to have a favor to ask of Erinse.
However, she is unable to say so.
Let me help her.
Since the incident with her daughter, the queen has completely lost her confidence.
Eälinänse, who knows the anguish of those at the top, wants to help somehow.
Rumors of her defeat of the dragon tribe in the Koaniani Forest had reached Jake's ears.
The request from him seemed to ...... still be dragon tribe related.
There have been a number of monster attacks in and around Salamzat.
When Charlotte heard about this, she couldn't stay away.
A troupe of traveling entertainers is said to be still in the area.
Let's go with her to see what is going on.
Inside Barnhart Castle, let's talk to Norbert.

Please wait for the next update!
Defeated Avaritia in "Zelma Mine Ruins".
The informant said that he had been instructed by Yugoslavia to "flee here if pursued by the Principality.
Perhaps he was planning to use Avaritia to take out the informant who was connected to him.
For the time being, we had a clue.
Let's go back to the castle and report to Duke Norbert.
I was able to learn about the situation in Ullau Township from Kapaqq.
A few years ago, Abaritia settled near the township.
Kapaq and his people tried to defeat it, but for some reason, the queen stopped them.
The forest was destroyed by Abaritia.
Recently, however, an entity appeared that subdued Abaritia.
It is called the "divine spirit" and is respected by the people of the forest.
If the divine spirit is an avaritia shell, it will not be easily handed over to them.
On the other hand, the dragon tribe is also active in the dark for the Avalitia Shell.
The situation surrounding "Ullau Township" and the forest people is very complicated.
As we were talking, we heard a sound coming from the bushes in the forest.
Someone was approaching the township.
Let's go with Kapakuk to see what's going on.
We had an audience with Pipimarca, the queen of the forest people.
She too seemed to remember that Adelaide and Carveen had visited the area.
Perhaps that is why, although she was calm at first, her attitude changed drastically when she heard the name of the Buffalian cult.
Apparently, they had incurred the queen's wrath.
She would not listen to him about the divine spirits, and she and Kapakuku were driven out of the mansion. ......
There was an eccentric nappo in the "Fever Swamp of Hades.
That nappo was Harao Kava Aku.
It is true that he has been close to Phi Phi Malka since he was a child, but he is so eccentric that he is shunned by the people of the forest.
Kapaqq gave him a bottle of "Nappo's Delicious Water" to calm him down, and somehow Kava Aku's mood was restored.
When I told him about Pipimarca's condition, Kava'aku's face turned somewhat mysterious.
He seemed to have an idea of what was going on.
Let's go to the Garden of the Great Sages and hear what Kava Aku has to say.
According to our informant, Yugoslavia had its eyes on the Koaniani Forest on the outer continent.
The "Koaniani Forest" is a region ruled by the forest people, and beyond that lies the grounds of the dragon tribe.
It seems that the goal was to deepen cooperation with the dragon tribe.
Considering the future of "the dragon tribe acquiring the avaritia shell," the "Koaniani Forest" must have an important meaning.
Carveen also offered to go to "Koaniani Forest" separately.
He seems to have some concerns about Avaritia Shell and his mother.
The next destination is "Koaniani Forest.
Let's get the information to the Buffarian Order and get ready to go.
It was Carveen who came to the forest.
Kapaq was surprised to hear Carveen's name. He had met Carveen's mother, Adelaide.
If what Hugo said was true, Avaritia Shell, or the divine spirit, might be Adelaide.
To confirm this, it would be necessary to go to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits" to see the spirit in person.
Kapakuk said, "If you cooperate with me, I can take you to see the queen.
He seems to have a purpose.
However, in order to enter "Ullau Township," he must undergo the "baptism of the forest.
It seems that Lalaforte will tell us the details.
It seems that Pipimarca hates the Buffalia cult.
It is for this reason that Lalaforte was expelled from "Ullau Township.
Carveen looked quite depressed after mentioning the cult.
To enter the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits," he would need permission from Pipimarca, but if that was too difficult, he would have to force his way through.
Kapakuku seemed determined to do so and asked us what we were prepared to do.
When we nodded, Kapakuk said with a stern look on his face, "I'll take you to see my people.
At the back of the "Tuonela Approach" appeared Erniges, an old general of the dragon tribe.
He had come to break the non-aggression pact with the forest people and seize the Avaritia Shell.
A battle was inevitable. Just as he was preparing himself, Avalitha burst in with a strange cry.
The mysterious Abaritia, which Kapakuk says is ravaging the forest.
Its appearance bore a striking resemblance to that of the transformed Yoruk.
Erniges shook off the avaritia, which grabbed him, and flew away into the sky.
The mysterious Abaritia attacked them.
When they managed to fight it off, the avaritia fled deep into the forest, dragging its wounded body with it.
Just as they were about to give chase, they heard the voice of Pipimarca.
There she found Pipimarca's men and Lalaforte, who had been captured by them.
The group of avengers had been subdued, and Lalaforte had fallen into the hands of Pipimarca and his men.
Even after informing them of the presence of Erniges, there was no change in Pipimarca.
With Lalaforte as a hostage, they could not resist, and they were all expelled from "Urlau Township." ......
Kava Aku told me about Pipimarca's past.
Pipimarca once fell in love with a Buffalian priest who came to the forest, and they had a daughter named Lulmana.
However, Lulumana was taken away by her husband and returned several years ago.
She returned several years ago in the form of a pseudo-avaritia.
The mysterious avaritia that ravages the forest is Pipimarca's daughter, Lulumana.
Therefore, Pipimarca forbids her to touch the avaritia and decides to leave the spirit that appeased it untouched.
Pipimarca was desperately trying to protect his daughter.
Kava Aku bowed down and asked him to save Pipimalka and Lulumana.
If anyone could do it, it would be Erinze. Erinze would be able to free Lulmana's soul.
Erinze would be picked up by Carveen.
Let's wait for their arrival at Kapaq's hideout.
I confronted and defeated Erniges at the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits."
In the back is the spirit, Avaritia Shell.
But her appearance had changed to that of Tirith herself. The fusion of Tirith and Avalitia Shell had progressed and even affected their appearance.
When Carveen and Erlinse called out, Avalitya Shell showed a faint response.
Adelaide and Tirith's consciousness clouded as they let out a small voice.
But there was a quick shadow of Hugo - a shadow of Hugo.
The next moment, the ground shook and burst apart.
Erniges had exerted his last ounce of strength to break the ice with Avaritia Shell.
Then new dragon tribes, Avuninte and Urgalum, appeared and took Avalitia Shell away.
The laughter of the Vordigens echoed in the void.
The worst possible future of "the dragon tribe getting the Avalitia Shell" has come true. ......

Evergreen Desert Let's check out the Wind Spirit Stage.
Evergreen Desert, talk with Charlotte at the Wind Spirit Stage.
We tried to communicate with Bashlar, but due to the disturbance of space-time, we could not obtain sufficient information.
However, it seems certain that "in the future, the dragon tribe will obtain the Avalitia Shell" in the future.
We need to find the Avaritia Shell before the dragon tribe does.
The Buffalian cult is joining the search.
If we talk to them at the temple, we may be able to get some clues.
The cult did not seem to have any new information on the Avaritia Shell.
On the other hand, the Duchy of Barnhart is tracking the movements of the dragon tribe.
However, it is said that their communication has been delayed for days.
Instead of waiting, it would be better to go and see what is going on.
Carveen is in charge of the investigation into the dragon tribe.
According to Duke Norbert, Carveen seems to have discovered a connection between Hugo and the dragon tribe Leenblum.
He is in pursuit of an informant who can provide proof of this, but he has not returned even after his scheduled return.
Hugo's men may still be in the Duchy, and Norbert is not able to devote his manpower to the task.
It was time for those of us who could move freely to help Carveen.
Carveen was at the "Zelma Mine Ruins.
He had already captured the informant, but he had something on his mind.
At that moment, the omnistron reacted.
Deep inside the "Zelma Mine Ruins" was Avalithia, which Carveen was trying to keep from getting out.
With the appearance of the avaritia shell, it is possible that this avaritia has gone berserk.
We can't just leave it there.
The Koaniani Forest is the land where the forest people live.
They avoid communication with the outside world, and if you visit them suddenly, they will not listen to you.
So Lalaforte, who has the blood of the forest people in her veins, agreed to guide us through the forest.
First, let's meet up with Lalaforte in Jubilia.
According to the people of Jubilia, a dragon tribe has been seen in the direction of the "Koaniani Forest.
Trade with the forest people seems to be less frequent these days.
There is an unusual atmosphere in the air. ......
Let's hurry to "Koaniani Forest".
We have arrived at the "Koaniani Forest.
Using the omnistron, we found a strong engram response further into the forest.
It might indicate the Avalitia Shell.
The location was the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits". It is inaccessible without the permission of the Queen of the People of the Forest.
The queen is in Ullau Township, the home of the forest people.
Let's go to "Ullau Township.
Lalaforte is sensing a disturbing presence.
Let's be on the alert.
The dragon tribe attacked from the sky and was repelled.
It seems that it is true that the dragon tribe is invading the "Koaniani Forest.
After the battle, a figure appeared from the forest.
It was Kapakuku, a warrior of the forest people.
He is a childhood friend of Lalaforte's and is said to be the gatekeeper of "Ululau Township.
When we told him that there might be dangerous avaritars in the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits," Kapakuk said, "I don't want others to hear," and asked us to move to his hideout.
He seemed to have an idea what was going on.
To meet the queen in "Ullau Township," we need to go through Kapakguk.
Let's hear what he has to say.
Lalaforte told me about the baptism in the forest.
You have to get the "Star Flower" at the "Flower Touring Grove".
This is the "baptism of the forest," and it is a sign of recognition by the forest.
However, it is said that there is a guardian who protects the "star flowers" near them. Be on your guard.
Head to the "Flowering Trees" and look for the "Star Flower.
I got the "star flower" safely.
Lalaforte says there is no problem.
I'll tell Kapakuk and ask him to let us enter "Ullau Township.
Kapaguk also recognized me as having completed the "Baptism of the Forest".
Now I can enter "Ullau Township.
Kapakuku will guide us to the queen.
However, Lalaforte has been expelled from "Ullau Township" for his faith in the Buffalian religion, so he cannot enter.
Head to the queen's mansion and ask for permission to enter the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits.
Kapaguk and his like-minded friends are on the Kazemi Plateau.
Head for the Kazami Plateau.
Kapaguk is met by a group of "defeatists" who are trying to restore peace by defeating the avaritas and spirits in the forest.
They were frustrated because Queen Pipimarca had forbidden them to touch Avalitia.
It seems that the plan was to defeat Avalitia while the divine spirits were appeasing her.
Kapakuku said that he would sneak into the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits" while his friends were causing a commotion.
Let's accompany Kapakguk to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits".
The group of avengers attracted the attention of the soldiers.
We must use this opportunity to break through the "Tuonela Road" that leads to the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits".
Many things have happened and things are in confusion.
Let's head to Kapaq's hideout and sort out the situation.
When we arrived at the hideout, Lalaforte, who had been liberated, came to us.
It seems that Pipimarca had no intention of hurting Lalaforte. She wants to protect her subjects as a queen.
However, she will not allow them to meddle with the divine spirits or the mysterious Avaritia.
It is not clear where Pipimarca's true intentions lie.
Kapakuku told us that Kava Aku, the original old man who lives in the forest, has been close to Pipimarca for a long time.
He seems to be a peculiar character, but he is a good person to learn about Pipimaruka's thoughts.
We should visit Kava Aku in the Fever Swamp of Hades.
While we were waiting for Erinze to arrive, the forest suddenly became noisy.
The dragon tribe had begun a full-scale invasion to seize Avalitia Shell.
If the Vordigens appeared, they might eat Lulumana, who had become an avaritia.
Of course, we could not give them the avaritia shell.
We must go to the "Tuonela Road" as soon as possible, and then to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits" at the end of the road.
In front of the entrance to the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits," Lulmana and Erniges were fighting.
Seeing Lulmana injured, Pipimarca raised a grief-stricken voice. However, it does not reach Lulmana.
Kapakuku protects Pipimalka, who is about to get caught up in the fight.
Realizing that all the circumstances are known, Pipimalka laughs to herself, but Kapakku interrupts her.
No one can blame her for being a mother before a king."
Herniges strikes down Lulmana and disappears to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits" with Avaritia Shell.
Carvein rushed there with Erlinse.
He leaves Lulmana and Pipimarca in charge and goes after Erniges. We cannot give the avaritia shell to the dragon tribe.
When Erlinse heard what happened, he performed a release ceremony for Lulmana.
Lulumana's soul is released and she says goodbye to Pipimarca.
The forest echoed with the lamentations of one mother--

Hello!　How's your adventure going?
My name is Varren. My partner is Carnera.
I'm an errand boy for the king collector!
We're currently collecting "Pieces of Ancient Mural" on his orders.
I was wondering if you would be willing to lend a hand?
Please accept our request and get more "Ancient Mural Pieces"!　Thank you for your help, hahaha!
Hahaha!　This is Mr. Vahlen, the King Collector's messenger!
Have you collected the "Pieces of Ancient Mural"?
Actually, I just found a big chunk of it, but there are monsters nearby. But there was a monster nearby.
I'm too beautiful to do anything with my body!
What do you think?　Would you be willing to retrieve the "Piece of Ancient Mural" for me?
It's a big job!　A powerful rival has emerged to collect the "Piece of Ancient Mural"!
The goblins of <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/> are restoring the mural just like us!
Some of them are robbing pieces for that purpose.
We can't just leave them there!　We need to defeat them and get back the pieces of the ancient mural that were stolen from us!
Speaking of festivals, sweets!　Are you interested in some nice sweets?
We're collecting a lot of sweets right now.
We could use your help.
I'm sure it'll do you some good. Ha ha!
How's the "fake sweets" collecting going?
Actually, I heard that a gluttonous monster ate a lot of "fake sweets".
I can't help it because they look so delicious, but I don't want them to eat them all up!
Can you help me defeat the monsters and collect the "fake sweets" that have been eaten?　Thank you very much!
I got a call that the peddlers would deliver the "fake sweets," but I'm in a bit of a bind.
It seems that they were stolen by a monster on the way.
The monster with the sweet tooth literally smelled it.
I want to get "Faux Suites" back and I can't leave the monster alone!
Can you help us?　Please!
Hey there!　Are you enjoying your summer in Asterleaze?
Do you have a swimsuit?
If not, why don't you accept a simple request?
As a reward, I will rent you a nice swimsuit!
Summer is all about swimsuits!　Don't miss out on this wave!　Hahaha!
When you think of summer, what do you imagine?　The ocean?　The sun?　Or physical beauty?
Of course, all of these are correct, but there is one thing that I just can't leave out!
It's a one-summer avant-garde fantasy!
A hot gaze beckons, a blazing summer fantasy. ......
But there are those who would like to steal your summer gaze away from you.
Adventurers, will you protect our summer?
Thanks to your defeat of the Shell Goblins, we have the summer's gaze all to ourselves!　It was supposed to be .......
Not yet. ...... Summer shouldn't be like this yet!
The glow of swimsuits!　The hot gazes that are directed at me!　Oh, summer, don't go away!
Don't let the shell goblins steal our summer!
Come on, let's take down more and more!　Summer's eyes are glued to you!
My husband is looking for something soft and fluffy.
He's been looking for something soft and fluffy, and "fluff crystals" just hit the spot, so he's been collecting them.
I'd like you to help me, if you don't mind.
I have a lot to reward you with!　Ha ha ha!
I can't get enough of the fluffiness of "Cottonmouth Crystal," can you?
So, there it is!　I'm going to follow my husband's lead and try my hand at creating my own original fashions using "fluff crystals!
Can you help me out while I collect the "fluff crystals"?
The "King Collector" is now in the final stages of making his "Cottonmouth Crystal" cushions.
We need the ultimate fabric to wrap the fluffiest of fluffy cushions!
We have no choice but to ask for the help of adventurers here.
Help us make my husband's fluffy dream come true!　Please, ha ha!
Right now, we are collecting "Whitecap Balls" on my master's orders.
They are beads that have drifted ashore from faraway foreign lands and were once used to form romantic picture scrolls.
Adventurers, why don't you get your hands on a "Whitecap Bead" and experience the romance of an ancient and exotic land?
We are collecting "Whitecap Beads" one after another.
Thanks to the cooperation of adventurers and everyone else, we've been able to do this!
However, it seems that goblins have been stealing the "Whitecap Balls" from us again and again.
Can you please collect the ones they have stored up?
How about collecting "Whitecap Balls"?
I wanted him to collect them without hesitation, but the goblins appeared again!
It seems they haven't given up on the "Whitecap Balls. At last, they're threatening to harm travelers and peddlers.
We can't just leave him there!
We need your help, adventurers!
My master has ordered us to collect the "petals of the fragrant blue flower.
It's a wonderful gift that will bless the happy bride and groom and make us happy as well!
Of course, adventurers will also be able to exchange their happiness for gorgeous prizes!
Will you help me collect the "Petals of Blue Fragrance"?　Hahaha!
I'm doing well in collecting "Petals of Blue Fragrance".
However, it seems that the goblins haven't given up on using them for flower divination!
This time, the Elder Goblins are taking the lead in trying to take the "Blue Fragrance Petals" with them!
It is the season of happy weddings!　We can't let them take away our blessings!
Will you help us defeat the Elder Goblins?
A pinch has come to the collection of "Petals of Blue Fragrance"!
This time, it seems that Mooks are planning to perform some kind of large-scale ritual using the "Blue Fragrance Petals!
It seems that they are going to collect "Blue Fragrance Petals" from all over the place and use them all at once.
We can't let this go unnoticed!
Adventurers!　Stop Mook's ritual and protect the "Blue Fragrance Petals!
We are currently collecting "King Collector Coins" under the orders of our master.
The "King Collector" created these coins on his own, but they have been stolen, to our dismay!
We need your help to punish the thieves and recover the "King Collector Coins"!
I was looking for someone who might have the "King Collector Coin" and I found some good information.
The coin is shiny, so I'm going to have to take a look at it!
The coin is shiny, so it looks like he was attracted to it and picked it up.
It would be a disaster if he eats them!
Help me retrieve the "King Collector Coin!
The "King Collector Coin" has been found in a strange place again!
It's in the arena in Asterleaze!
It seems that there are "King Collector Coins" mixed in with the prize money in the arena!
I think most people would be upset if they were handed these!
Can't you just clear the arena and collect them secretly?
Right now, we are collecting "Spilled Star Sand" on my master's orders.
It's those fantastic pieces that fall from the sky at this time of year!
Isn't it romantic to make a wish on star-shaped sand?
I need your help to collect the "Sand of Spilling Stars"!
I'm counting on you, hahaha!
Have you collected the "Sand of Spilling Stars"?
The kids are making wishes and collecting it, but I heard something bad!
The bandits have stolen the "Sand of Spilling Stars" that we went to so much trouble to collect.
We can't just let this go!
I want you to get the "Sand of Spilled Stars" back from the riffraff!
How is your "Sand of Spilled Stars" collection going?
Everyone is having fun, but there is a troubling rumor going around.
It is said that the "Sand of the Spilled Stars" is more likely to make wishes come true if it is collected with great effort.
It seems that some young people have taken this to heart and are going to the "foot of the mountain of tranquility" to make their wishes come true.
Can you help them to defeat the monsters and let them know that it is a dangerous place?
We are currently collecting "Merry Red for the Holy Night" on my master's orders.
We're going to decorate the young trees with bright decorations and make everyone's wishes come true on the holy night!
We'll be giving away some great prizes to adventurers as well!
I hope you will collect the "Merry Red for the Holy Night!　Hahaha!
How's the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" collecting going?
We have prepared a young tree for decoration.
However, the "snow-covered boa" appeared everywhere. They are eating the buds of our precious young trees!
They are going to grow up together with their children!
Adventurers, will you help us defeat these "snow-covered boas"?
I'm counting on you to protect this wonderful festival!　Hahaha!
The "Merry Red of the Holy Night" is gathering rapidly!
Thanks to you adventurers, we're having a great time on this holy night!
However, I wonder if the festive atmosphere has also made the "snow-covered boas" excited?
I feel like there are more and more of them!
It seems that some of them have swallowed the "Merry Red of the Holy Night," and I need you adventurers to get rid of them!
My master has ordered us to collect "Spring Welcoming Flowers".
They are good luck charms to celebrate the new year in a distant foreign land!
Let's collect as many as we can and share the festive spirit with everyone!
In return, I have prepared some gorgeous prizes for you!　Hahaha!
Thank you for collecting the "Spring Welcoming Flowers"!
We were doing well, but then an unexpected rival appeared!
It seems that Skyfish have been attracted by the beauty of the "Spring Welcoming Flowers" and have been eating them from one end to the other!
We can't let them interfere with our "Spring Welcoming Flowers" collection!
We need your help to defeat the Skyfish!
Congratulations on your beautiful collection of "Spring Welcoming Flowers"!
I wonder if such congratulations attract the hearts of the monsters as well?
The Horngoats are decorating their beds with "Spring Welcoming Flowers"!
I'd like to say it's quaint and beautiful, but it looks like they're taking the "Spring Welcoming Flowers" away from where people are.
This is wrong!　It is not beautiful!
Help us defeat the Horngoats!　Hahaha!
Right now, we're collecting "fairy lotus nectar" under my master's orders.
It's a very sweet and sparkling nectar.
We want to serve sweets made with it to everyone in town!
Can you adventurers lend a hand?
If you collect the "Nectar of the Fairy Lentils," we will exchange it for some great prizes!
The sweets made with the "nectar of the fairy lily" have been very well received!
However, the "King Collector" said, "I want to add a twist that will make it unique! He said selfishly, "I want to make it one-of-a-kind!
So I'm thinking of adding a playful touch of color!
Can you help me gather the materials?
Thank you for collecting the "nectar of the fairy lily!
The baking was getting exciting, and everyone in the town decided to join in!
However, the farm that provides us with the ingredients is in trouble because it has been ravaged by monsters.
We can't just leave them to their own devices!
We need your help to save the farmers!
Our master has ordered us to collect "Maigurat's Old Paper.
We're going to use it for a little treasure hunt to coincide with the opening of the port of Asterlys!
To keep everyone entertained, we need your help, adventurers!
Thanks to your help, the collection of the "Maigurat Paper" is going well.
But there is one problem.
There's a monster out there that loves to eat old Maigurat paper!
And it has a big appetite, so it's a big problem!
We have to do something before they eat up all the old Maigurat papers!
We need to do something before they eat up all the "Maigurat's Old Paper"!
I was looking for the scattered "Maigurat's Old Paper".
I found it in an unexpected place. It's a prize from the arena!
Asterlys is very crowded during the Port Opening Festival!　Maybe that's why the package got mixed up.
I want to retrieve it, but to do so, I have to challenge them in the arena!
Can you help us, adventurers, with your skills?
We are currently collecting "gold dust sap" under my master's order.
Insect collecting is a big boom among children.
There is an amazing insect called the "King of Gold Helmet," and my master has heard about it and wants it!
The "gold dust sap" is a stepping stone!　What do you think?　How about you join us, adventurers, and follow the romance of the boys?
Are you collecting gold dust sap?
I'm thinking of expanding my collecting area, but it seems that Rumblebore has developed a taste for gold dust sap.
Whenever I try to collect it, they come close to me.
I want to get rid of them while I can!
Adventurers, can you help us?
How is the gold dust sap collection coming along?
Thanks to you and everyone else, we've gathered a lot of it.
It may not be a dream to catch the King of the Golden Helmet!
But it seems there's another obstacle in our way!
Meen from the Ritze Trading Road has intercepted our gold dust sap and is eating it!
Adventurers, will you help us punish these people who are stealing everyone's dreams?
The "Port Opening Festival" is the biggest event in Asterleaze!
Feste seems to be enjoying himself as well.
Apparently, he has heard some interesting rumors ......?
Carveen and Charlotte are also coming to play.
Carveen, however, is somewhat unflattering ......?
Erinse and Einlein can be seen.
It seems that they are having trouble ......?

I am a class master.
Young adventurer, let me help you.
If you want to reach the highest level, do not settle for just one class.
You must study multiple classes and re-evaluate yourself based on a broad knowledge of the world.
To help you do so, I will prepare a path of "class change" for you.
First, deepen your understanding of the class and use it as a stepping stone.
The encounters that await you there will surely lead you to new horizons.
I am Riza, the director of the orphanage.
Like everywhere else, we are short of staff. We're having a hard time replenishing the supplies we need.
Can you help me with that?
It's a simple task, just picking up things from the merchants.
I'll even pay you a gratuity.
I'll make sure to pay you a gratuity!
...... Oh, I'm sorry for the sudden appearance.
My name is Ariane, a perfumer. I'm a perfume maker.
I'm having a bit of a nose problem right now. ......　Shhhh..!
Anyway, I want to collect ingredients for my new perfume.
But there is a herd of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> nearby and I can't get into the mountain. Can you please get rid of them?
Please help me. ......　Hack shun!　Hk-shun!
This is a request from the Pioneer Bureau.
We have a letter from a substitute writer, Lindsey. ......
The handwriting is completely different and I don't think it was written by Lindsey.
It is difficult to read because of the messy handwriting, but I think the name of the addressee is probably "Saul.
Could you please deliver the letter to him and find out what is going on?
My name is Melis, and I live in Minsterhorn. I don't care what my name is!
You are the only one who can save this village!　Please, help me!
My cousin Katya made soup with paralyzing poison.
And since she had a lot of it left over, she said she was going to give it away to all kinds of people. ......
If we don't stop her, we will be in trouble!
I'm Elsie, the butcher!
I'm in trouble!　The cows of Minsterhorn are being attacked by <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>!
As a lover of cows, I cannot overlook this!　Please join me in defeating it!
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>...the...unforgivable!
Hi, I'm Blue Lynn the Bard, born in Minsterhorn.
I want to write a song about a local specialty to promote my hometown, but I'm stumped on the concept.
I'd like to get some opinions and ideas.
What do you think?　Would you like to join me in writing a song that is unique to Minsterhorn?
My name is Lukas. I'm traveling with my partner Klaus.
We have a job for you, since we think you are a great adventurer. Can you carry our luggage to Minsterhorn?
We had hoped to do it ourselves, but circumstances made it impossible.
This may be too easy a task for you, but please do it!
Hey there, fellows. I'm Lonsdale, an adventurer who specializes in monster slaying.
I'm on my way to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> monsters at the request of the Pioneer Bureau, and I was wondering if you'd like to help me out.
I think it would be a good money maker.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>We don't want to lose anyone.
How about a little profit on the side?
This is Baumann, the mine owner. Can you do me a favor?
I have a delivery for a doctor named Volker in Lalpar. I need you to collect and deliver a stone called "shadow algae stone".
It's a rare fossil from around here. Normally we'd be mining it, but there are monsters nearby.
I'll give you a sample and you can go and get it yourself. I'm sorry.
It's a strange coincidence that you would accompany me to a place like this.
If you would be so kind, would you do me a favor?
Someone has asked me to dispose of some belongings, but it's a little out of my hands. ......
I am a complete stranger, but I would be happy if you would accept my request.
My name is Giles, a butler in the service of a certain lord.
I am Giles, the butler, and I am in the service of your lordship.
I have not been notified, and it seems to have gone missing somewhere.
If you don't mind, I wonder if you could search for it with me.
I'm Paulette, the smoker. Smokey?　I hope you'll forgive me.
I heard that there is a kiln in the Buffalo legacy that can smoke anything in an instant.
I've asked him to restore it and I want him to go pick it up.
I can't wait to try it out. I can't wait to try it out.
I'm a fisherman, Hubby. I always fish for musclefish in the river, but lately I haven't been able to catch any.
Musclefish are very powerful and should be able to climb up waterfalls with no problem. But I can't find them in the river.
Something must have happened downstream.　I want you to go check it out.
My name is Mino. I am the strongest and lone soldier in the world!
No matter where you look in the world, there is no one who can match me.
Because I am the best and the loneliest Soldier!
Are you an adventurer?　Then let me challenge you!
Because I am the strongest and the loneliest Soldier!
Let us decide right here and now which of us is the strongest!
My name is Shayla. I sell lunch boxes in Asterlys.
They have a reputation for being quite tasty.
But today we sold a little too many. I ran out of ingredients.
Can you deliver some to me?
I'm Rike, the potion-mixer. Hee-hee.
I need you to get some ingredients for a new potion concoction. I'm not asking for anything shady, okay?
I'm looking forward to working with you. Baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon .......
My name is Blundell. I'm a blacksmith.
I'm trying to make a new weapon, but I'm missing some materials. I'm in a bit of a bind right now.
I need you to deliver some of them for me, can you do it?
Hi, there!　I'm Shayla from Bento Restaurant.
I've prepared a lunch box for the daily special, but it's kind of lacking in color.
I'd like to offer you an extra dish.
If you don't mind, I'd like you to take me for a spin.
I'm still working on the transformation potion. I need materials for the next stage. I'd like you to go back and get them.
I told you, it's not suspicious. See?　Hee-hee-hee-hee .......
I'm Blundell, blacksmith.
I've found a new manufacturing method, but it requires materials I've never used before.
I was wondering if you could help me find it?
I'm Cecil, an employee of the Pioneer Bureau.
I am currently investigating certain information. There is a mysterious oral tradition in Berkmar that is considered heretical by the Buffalians.
The Pioneer Bureau would like to conduct a detailed investigation because it may provide us with clues to grasp the ecology of the monster.
Please, we would appreciate your cooperation!
Hey, hey, you, Anta ....... Why don't you look for corpses ......?
No, no!　I'm sorry to barge in here like this. I'm Girsch. I'm a thug, as you can see.
The guy I want you to find is an adventurer named Yoan. He's a great friend who hangs out with the likes of me. He's been trying to get me away from the monsters at .......
I can't sleep at night wondering what happened to him!　Please. At least find me a clue!　As you can see, I'm a peddler, Bessemer!
I'm Bessemer, the peddler.
Do I look tired? Yes, I was attacked by bandits. I escaped with my life.
But among the goods they took from me, there was something I really needed.
I'm sorry for the danger of this job, but could you please help me get it back?
My name is Tria, and I was evacuated from Berkmar.
My sister left my favorite stuffed animal behind. When we ran away from Avaritia, I couldn't bring it to her because it was too dangerous. ......
But since then, my sister has been looking sad.
Please can you help me find the stuffed animal?
I'm Herit, the deliveryman. Ahhhh, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
I forget about work when I look up at the sky like this.
I was thinking about ......, but the other day I actually fell into the sea with my whole package. It's dangerous, so I don't force myself to deliver when I'm in this kind of mood.
So, I was wondering if you could do the delivery for me?
No problem. They're all near the transfer portal, so it'll only take a few minutes.
My name is Bosch. Actually, I have a crush on a girl at .......
I'd like to get close to her, but in order to do so, I really need to eat some very spicy food.
I know you don't know what I'm talking about, but it's true.
Please do me a favor. Can you get me a medicine that will allow me to eat hot and spicy food so that I can fulfill my love?
My name is Maciej, and I run a farm in Minsterhorn.
My chickens are being hunted by <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>!
They're going to eat us if we don't do something!
Anne, Alice, Bonnie, Victoria...!
Get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/> and save my chickens!

Good day, adventurers.
I'm Rainie, a love slave enchanted by Master Huovi.
The other day, Master Huovi asked me, "Will you make me a weapon? I was working on it without sleep or rest.

I cannot stop crafting.
Adventurer, can't you help me again? I would like to ask you to help me again.
If not, I ...... will be your help!
I'm Eubank of the Astéries Guard.
I'm Eubank of the Asterlys Guard, and I'm here to train my men a bit. I have arranged a recreational training program for them.
But the higher-ups said it was too dangerous.
I said, "Of course it's not too dangerous!　To prove that, why don't you go out there and do it?
Hello. I'm Einar, an actor.
I'm going to dance in the next play. ......

Hello. I'm Louise.
I'm researching liquid memory in cooperation with the Pioneer Bureau.
I am currently developing a new bottle of liquid memory.
It's very difficult to collect materials, and I'm having a hard time.
Hey, adventurers! Can you help me gather the materials?
It's not an easy request, but I'll give you a special reward.
If you are confident in your strength, please give it a try!

I'm Mare, and I'm helping to organize a team of adventurers.

I'm trying it out to see if it's really effective and to give you some advice!
I need your help to prove it.
I'm Frederik, a researcher with the Pioneering Bureau.
Suddenly, have you ever heard of the "floating island in the void"?

Combat is inevitable. Please be fully prepared.

My name is Zoe, a fortune teller and merchant.
Actually, I am currently looking for a certain medicinal herb that is not commonly distributed to the public.
A pregnant woman in our neighborhood has an unfavorable phase, and it could lead to a serious problem if we don't give her an exorcism while we can.
However, the flowers for this are not easily available and can be found at .......
You are qualified to help us when you hear this request.
If you would like to help us, we would appreciate it.
I'm Patty, an apprentice clerk at a memory stand!
Adventurer, just in time!
I've been asked to order materials for the liquid memory jars. But ordering is kind of a pain in the ass. ......
So why don't we just order from adventurers?
So, I asked the adventurer!
Go find the materials for the bottles. In return, I will give you a new bottle!
I am Andor. I'm a fisherman!
I'm trying to spread the word about fishing. I'm always trying to spread the word to adventurers and townspeople alike.

We have taken steps to help you in this process.
I hope it will help you in your fight.
Good day to you. I am Marguerite, a new adventurer.
I am in a great deal of trouble regarding a request I accepted. ......
I was told "just get some common materials," but I can't find what I'm looking for, no matter how hard I search.
It is not in any of the stores I am familiar with, and when I asked my acquaintances and friends, no one knew about it. ......
I'm afraid I'm not very good at this, but can you help me?
I am Ranveil, the genius magician and engineer of the Imagine Institute!
My colleague has asked me to help him defeat the Mook Scouts.
It shouldn't be too difficult if I have a weapon that has been "pushed to its limits.
But for the sake of my new magic, the weapons I brought with me have been sacrificed!
As it is, we will not be able to defeat the Mook Scouts. Furthermore, I will be angry with you about the weapons.
You, adventurer. Will you be asked to help us defeat the Mook Scouts?
This is an official request from the Pioneer Bureau to defeat a monster.
Please defeat the "<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>" that appears in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>" in the Asteria Plains.

Even if your opponent is "<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/>", don't overdo it.
Please do your best to become a full-fledged adventurer!
◆Targets for Defeat (Location to be defeated)

Wave sound ore 3 pieces (<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>) / Mineral
The bridge used for the investigation of "Giant Dragon's Claw Tracks" has become old and needs to be repaired.
We have asked a craftsman from Minsterhorn to do the work, but he is unable to get close to it because monsters roost in the area.
Please ensure the safety of the work by defeating the powerful monsters that appear in the deepest part of the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon: Additional Investigations".
We appreciate your cooperation!
1 Raging Goblin King (Claw Traces of Giant Dragon, Additional Research)
Dr. Estrina, a goblin researcher who has a cooperative relationship with the Pioneer Bureau, has asked us to collect research materials.

Star Pit Investigation Team 1
Star Pit Investigation Team 2
I'm Lucas, a novice adventurer.
Thanks for carrying our stuff for us the other day. I got into trouble because of the whims of my partner Klaus.
Now I need your help again.
Klaus is now refusing to listen to me, saying that he's going to go out and hunt down monsters. It's definitely not something we're capable of doing. ......
Please. Please help me stop Klaus!
My name is Lector, adventurer and scholar.
I was on my way to Asterlys with an important cargo when I got caught in a storm. We were stranded.
You are an adventurer with a lot of spirit, I see. This package must be delivered for the future of the people.
Will you please lend me your help?
Hello. My name is Tini, the maid.
A cat escaped from the mansion and I'm searching for it. Oh, I'm so tired!
And the cat is injured, but it's still going away.
Isn't it tedious?
I can't just leave it there. I'll do what I have to do, so can't you help me find the cat?
I'm really tired.
Hello. My name is Cyril, a guard of the Buffalian faith.
I have a little favor to ask of adventurers. I need you to help me find some hard-to-find ingredients. ......
I'm sorry. I can't tell you any more here. ......
I'll tell you more about it, but first, I want you to come to the garrison of the Buffalian Order in the "Andorra Basin".
Thank you very much!
My name is Myrlene. I have asked that this request be posted if Dr. Wahlkin has not returned after 5 days.
If the adventurers are reading this, that means ......, right? That's what I'm talking about.
He's probably busy excavating somewhere in the Asteria Plains anyway, so can you give him a little help?　It's probably time to run out of preserves.
I'm sure he'll be saying, "I'm not leaving until the excavation is finished! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm looking forward to working with you.
Oh, my. Your clothes are beautifully designed.
I'll ask you to do it!　I think I'll ask you to do it. I've been looking for an adventurer with a sense of style.
I'm Thierry. I'm an up-and-coming designer.
I'm thinking of starting my own brand.
But I'm in a bit of a bind.
I need materials for my new fashion line.
I was wondering if you could help me gather them?　No?
My name is Ryuk. I am a man who aspires to be a warrior.
I ask this of you because of your skill. I need to gather some materials for a "proof" that will reveal my firm determination.
Originally, I should have done it alone. Unfortunately, however, there is no time. I may not be able to do it by myself.
Please help me!　You are right!
I am Feodor, a scholar who studies weather. My goal is to achieve accurate weather forecasting.
I would like to collect observation records from the Asteria Plain. I'm looking for collaborators who can visit the places where the monsters appear.
The recording itself will be quick. Can you lend me your help?
My name is Bart. I am an apprentice cook training at Asterias.
The other day, the head chef gave me an assignment, but I don't think I can complete it on my own.
Please, adventurer, I need your help.
Will you join me in completing the dish?
My name is Radim. I'm on a pilgrimage with my mother and father to a holy place in Buffalia.
But it seems that <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/> has appeared on the road. It's closed to traffic.
I don't mind pilgrimages, but... I don't mind going on pilgrimages, but if I'm stuck here for days at a time, I'll be bored out of my mind!
Adventurers, can you help me kill <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>?
I'm Ciri, apprentice restorer of the Buffalian heritage.
If you're an adventurer, you're crafting, right?　The "Tumbling Sphere Neration Ritual," the heritage of Buffalia that you use for that, is amazing, isn't it?
It's big, imposing, and looks very sturdy.
But inside, it's an incredibly complex combination of delicate parts. It needs to be inspected regularly, but we don't have enough stuff to do the work.
Can you help me gather some of it?
My name is Remigio. I'm a future businessman!
I don't think there's any harm in doing you a favor. I think, so I wonder if you could go to ...... with me to apologize.
Actually, there is someone I need to apologize to. I just can't find the courage to do it alone. ......
Please, come with me!
I'll apologize to you too!　So please apologize with me!
Hey there, I'm Durga, an adventurer.
I was collecting "Sand Viper's Triangle Scale" for the Pioneer Bureau. I was on my way to collect the "Sand Viper Triangle Scales" for the Pioneer Bureau, when a Land Hawk took my weapon.
I couldn't continue with the request if I was unarmed.
I'm sorry, but could you collect the Sand Viper's Triangular Scales for me?
Help!
I'm Carrion, a new guard. I'm Carrion, a new guard, and I've been ordered by my captain to go to ...... to defeat the monsters.
I can't do it!　What do you expect from a newbie like me?
But they won't let me unless I kill a certain number of monsters. ......
There's no other way but to ask the adventurers for help!　Please!
I'm Panayote. I'm a lowly priest of the Buffalian faith.
While I'm sent out to do chores here and there, I pick up trash along the streets and around the city.
Today I'm going to clean up the area between Salamzat and the Fountain of the Hermits.
But lately, monsters have been popping up outside of town more and more often.　I need the help of adventurers who can fight.
I'd like you to help me pick up trash along with the guards. Thanks in advance!
I made a bit of a blunder.
I ordered the wrong ingredients and ordered them from Montenol.
I ordered the wrong ingredients, I ordered them from Montenegro, but the flavors are different if they're not from Evergreen.
Can you go get them for me, please?
Hey there. I'm Rike, the concocter. Hee-hee-hee.
Are you getting used to the way I laugh?　That's fine, baboon baboon .......
I've been mixing up a makeover potion, but I'm in need of some strange ingredients again.
This time it's a piece of a monster. They are not easy to find.
But if we ask the Pioneer Bureau or other adventurers, they will find out about the potion.
Then we will have to ask ...... you, won't we?
Hee-hee-hee. I've gone along with you this far.
Please don't be so rude to me now, okay?　Hee-hee-hee-hee .......
I'm Blundell, weaponsmith.
I'm trying the old manufacturing method, but the weapons aren't strong enough.
I've been doing some research and found out that they use materials from monsters as well as ore.
I don't know where to get the materials.
You are the only adventurer I know.
I need your help again.
I'm Rasha, the owner of the Litze Mining Association. My husband is the mine manager. I take care of the artisans and the bookkeepers.
There are many <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> living around our mine.
They can be dangerous if left unchecked, so we have to kill a certain number of them on a regular basis.
If you like, you could ask me to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> for you.
Adventurers!　How about a little more?
My name is Garb. I'm a merchant looking for local specialties and products.
I have a story about that in Litze. There's a fish called "streaky fish," which is a good luck charm. Do you know about it?
I saw a school of them in the river the other day.
If we catch them and sell them, we will make a fortune!　What do you say?　How about it?
Hi, I'm Trace. I'm just starting out on my journey.
I'm about to go on a trip to collect beautiful landscapes from all over the world with my "Imagine the Landscape".
There is someone I really want to show the scenery of various places to.
First of all, I plan to look around the Litze area.
However, traveling is always dangerous.
I would like to ask you to escort me for a little while. What do you think?
Ha ha ha!　I am Guido. I am a genius detective who shows up where there is a mystery, and always manages to get to the bottom of it!
However, this time, I can say that it is a difficult case even with my clear mind.
A "series of camel thefts" in the vicinity of Salamzat!　I hear that the culprits never show up and only the camels disappear like a mirage. ......
What do you think?　Let's try to solve the mystery of this case together!
My name is Ardlung, the owner of a jewelry store.
I was transporting some jewelry that I purchased when my carriage was attacked by a swarm of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> and my cargo was stolen.
I am out of business if this continues.
Please, can you help me get my goods back?
I'm Jin, a hunter from Salamzat. You took care of me sometime ago.
My son is going to perform a ceremony to become a hunter, but a trouble happened. <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> has broken out.
I can't help my son, but if left unchecked, they could harm innocent people.
I wonder if you could help me to reduce the number quickly.
I am Remigio. I'm a future merchant!　There's no harm in ingratiating myself with you!
The other day, a friend of mine from school boasted to me about a treasure called the "Testament of Courage.
I've had my dad show me all kinds of treasures, but I've never seen anything that beautiful. ......
I knew I had to have it!
I heard that to find the "Proof of Courage," I would need the help of an adventurer.
Will you search for the "Proof of Courage" with me?　You'll be rewarded!
Hey. You're an adventurer, right?　I'm Suzette. I'm a mercenary.
The other day, I received a strange lamp as a reward for my work, but I didn't know how to use it. I asked a friend of mine, a scholar named Ferena, to help me figure it out.
I had no idea what she was talking about, and when I told her that she was talking too hard, she got mad at me.
I'm sorry, but I need you to go talk to him again.
Hello again. I'm Wahlkin, a priest of the third order.
Actually, I've heard that a mysterious coin glowing in rainbow colors can be found in the ruins of Buffalia near here. If it were true, I would like to go and pick it up myself, but that thing has been nagging at me lately.
He said, "The next time I send a search request, I will deduct the reward from your research fund.
So, would you be willing to search for the coins for me?
My name is Kurt!　I'm the son of a grocer.
I know a dairy farmer, Mr. Reuben, who has some Buffalo heritage. I'd like to get him to give it to me somehow, because it would definitely help his business!
But it's better for an adult to ask him than a kid like me, right?　Would you go talk to him for me?
For the sake of my grocer. Please!
Hi, I'm Paolo, a traveling puppeteer.
I travel around the city performing puppet shows for children.
Today I was performing in the square. During the performance, my precious Ellie disappeared.
Ellie is a puppet in the shape of a cat. She is my best work and my dearest friend.
Please, I'm begging you. Can you help me find Ellie?
Hi, I'm Einar, the actor.
I'm working on a role for my next play. I'm having a hard time getting an idea of what the role is going to be.
I was looking for someone to play the role, and I saw someone who fits the bill!
I don't know who he is, but he's the only one for me.
Can you help me find him?
Hi, I'm Terua.
I got a letter from my uncle Bros. today. He's in trouble and wants me to send someone over.
However, I'm not exactly a place to go lightly.
I know he's a stubborn and eccentric man, but I was wondering if you could help him out a bit. I'd appreciate it.
I'm Manfredo. I'm Manfredo, a well-known and wealthy man in this town.
I'm in the process of renovating my home.
I need you to pick up a headboard I ordered from Mr. Aurélie, a well-known sculptor in Asterleiz.
The due date has already passed, but I guess that's just the way artists are.
I'm not going to get mad at him over something like that. I'm not going to get mad at them for that!
If the headboard is finished, please send it to me.
If not, ask me for a new due date.
My name is Cattleya. I'm looking for a good business partner.
I wonder if you have heard of the "Fangworks of Khartoum".
It is a craft that was made when the ancient desert city of Khartoum was prosperous.
The craft has been lost with the decline of the city. ......
I would like to revive this "Khartoum tusk work".
It will be good business for sure. I have a feeling.
What do you say?　Can you help me?
My name is Laure, a Buffalian priest.
There have been reports of dangerous monsters appearing in the Evergreen Desert at "<value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>".
In fact, we asked our adventurers to investigate ahead of time, but they have not been able to return and we are worried about them. ......
Please could you go and check on them?
Hello, adventurer.
I have a job for you.
I need you to collect and deliver hunting tools to a young hunter.
I used to be able to gather them myself when I was younger, but I'm a grandmother now.
It's getting harder and harder.
But it shouldn't be so difficult if you are an adventurer.
I am Berger of the Pioneer Bureau. I only send out this request to prospective adventurers.
Have you heard of a team of adventurers called Dragon Crow?　They are the legendary adventurers who first broke through the Claw Trail of the Giant Dragon.
The route they used is now the gateway to success for advanced adventurers. It is a tough and difficult path, but if you can complete it, you will be recognized as a first-rate adventurer. Why don't you give it a try?
Clear the route
The fierce battle!　Claw marks of the Giant Dragon
I'm Kurt, the grocer!　I'm in trouble!
My sister Nora is missing!
She's blind. She was always with me.
I don't know where she went.
Maybe someone took her, maybe she was attacked by a monster. ......
Please!　I need you to help me find my sister!
Asteria Forestry Association, but I need a favor.
Recently, we've been having a problem with some angry <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/>that have been raging out of control and damaging the forest.
The commercial value of the timber is reduced and some of the timber has to be cut down and disposed of.
Although damage caused by wild animals is an inevitable part of the forestry business, we can't afford to overlook it any longer.
Can you go and reduce the number of <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/> a little bit?

We are a research team from Basdolphin Memorial University.
We are investigating the "Mukh's Marker Stone", which is a stone that <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_02001"/> inhabits the "Dawn Worm Fortress".
At first glance, the "Mook's Marker Stone" appears to be just a stone, but it seems to warn of danger and share the location of its prey depending on the placement of the stone and its pattern.
If we can decipher them, it will be easier to avoid conflict with the mooks.
We would like to ask you to collect "Muk's Marker Stones" by doing "<value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>".

It glows blue and is very beautiful!

My name is Doni, a historian.
I would like to use the "Glass of Ruins" as a reference material in my lectures to students.
I am in a bit of a bind because I don't have enough of them.
The glass found around the ruins of Buffalia is very different from that of today.
They are very good materials that show the high level of processing technology of the time, such as their sturdiness, sophistication, and complexity of form.
I believe you can collect it at "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".

Hey there!　I'm Mea, helping to organize the team.

Hello, I'm Suruho. I work in a rose garden.
Actually, I received a mysterious plant from a customer. It's supposed to be a magnificent flower, but no matter how long I wait, it doesn't bloom at all.
I tried various things, but I couldn't get it to bloom. ......
I want to do something to make it bloom, so will you help me?
My name is Monica.
The other day, I saw something that really caught my attention. I saw my childhood friend, Seul-ho, giving a bouquet of roses to his older sister!
What kind of relationship do they have?
I'm curious, but I don't have the courage to ask him myself. ......
Please go find out about that sister!　Please do!
My name is Isaac, and I am a miner.
I'm training under my master, Mr. Baumann. I lost something very important in a cave. ......
I have to report it to my master, but I'm so scared that my legs are trembling. Please tell my master what happened instead of me!
Oh, this is Baumann, who is in charge of the mine.
I'm Baumann, who's in charge of the mine. I've been making a memorandum about the mineral veins around here for a long time. Somewhere along the line, a vein I didn't know was in there.
I can't believe that there is a vein of ore that I don't even know is in the Great Litze Cave.
I don't have enough hands to confirm it.
Can you go check if the vein is real or not?
You have a nice face!　I can feel your star power.
I'm Barni. I'm the world's first adventurer producer.
What do you think?　How would you like to be the first adventurer producer in the world?
You'll be a top star and have everything you want: status, honor, money, and more.
Come on, take your first step to glory with me!
My name is Rasha. I look after the miners who work in the mine.
We have a young miner named Akka. Lately, he hasn't been able to get any work done.
I know it's a tough time for you and your girlfriend in your private life.
You see, it's troublesome when the boss interferes in these matters, isn't it?　To be honest, I'm interested. But you know what?
I don't want things to get complicated, so I'd like you to find out instead. Please.
Hey, I'm Dr. Volker.
I'm Dr. Volker, and I hear there's a strange drug on the market these days.
It's called "Avaritia Prophylaxis" (......).
The Order of Buffalia has asked me to help them. I can't do it by myself.
I need to do a thorough investigation, and I was wondering if you could help me.
I am Uro, a woodworker. I make wooden souvenirs.
We get very good lumber in this area.
But this is not something you can just cut in the forest. They are ancient relics.
So it is very hard to find for someone like me who does not know how to fight.
It's about to run out, so I need you to find it for me.
My name is Garb. I am a street vendor.
I'm going to start a business in Salamzat, and there's a guy who's going to be a nuisance.
No, no, no, I'm not a business rival. There's actually an attack on a traveler on the road between Salamzat and Litze.
If we don't do something about it, we'll lose business.
The others are also in trouble. Can you do something about it?
My name is Pissarri. I'm an adventurer just like you.
I came here on a request. ...... Actually, you know what?
I'm ...... lost.
Please take me to a place called "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon".
Please!
My name is Mino. I'm the strongest and loneliest hero!
You think you were supposed to be a Soldier?　Huh, I've put that past behind me. I am now the greatest and lone hero!
I will fight again to surpass you!　Because I am the strongest and lone hero!
Hoo ....... Hi, I'm Aaron, an adventurer.
I'm looking for a flower called "Kouka" that blooms around here. It's an extremely rare desert flower that is only told about in legends.
As an adventurer, doesn't this pique your curiosity?
Huff ....... I want to get my hands on this flower.
Can you help me?
My name is Quan, a medicine man.
Do you know Tsurka, the adventurer?　She used to take care of me a long time ago.
She seems to be getting sick lately, and I'm worried about her.
I need you to deliver some medicine to Tulka.
My name is Bale. I have lived in Salamzat for generations.
I found something in the attic of the barn that looks like a Buffalian legacy. According to the note, it was borrowed from someone by his dead father.
Even though it was a long time ago, it was impossible to leave it as it was.
I would like to return it to its owner, but I wonder if you could help me.
My name is Sabrina.
I am a woman who loves singing, theater, fiction ...... and all the arts.
Right now, the person I admire the most. Einar is one of the most talented young actors of all time.
What I want to ask of you is what any lover of the expressive arts would ask of me.
Go to ...... and get my autograph!　Please!
My father is a traveling painter.
That's why he's not always home.
This time he went to Litze, leaving a note saying he was going to paint the mountains.
It's boring without my father!
Please find him and tell him to come home!
I'm Emilee. I want to be an actress!
But my parents won't let me. I tried to convince them over and over and over again!
Then my father told me, "I have an assignment for you.
If I complete this, it means he'll approve of me, right?
Please!　Will you help me?
I'm Sisto. I work for the Pioneer Bureau.
Recently, we have confirmed that someone has been raiding cemeteries in various parts of the Asteria Plain.
I have instructed my subordinate, Cecil, to investigate this matter, but ...... there is something fishy going on.
The usually calm Cecile seemed strangely distraught.
I'm sorry, but I need your help with her.
Excuse me, my name is Paula, a cafe clerk.
Our valued customer, Catherine, has forgotten her handkerchief.
Normally, I or one of the other waitstaff should be able to deliver it to you right away. ......
Unfortunately, we are busy and no one is available.
Could you please deliver the forgotten handkerchief to Ms. Catherine?
I am Baphit. I am a calligrapher who has been trying to promote the art of calligraphy.
I would like to ask you to take care of my granddaughter, Lindsey.
She has said she will follow in my footsteps. ...... I was wondering if she was saying that out of concern for me.
I am wondering what Lindsay's true feelings are.
So I wrote a letter to her.
Please take it to Lindsey and ask her about it.
The tragedy that befell the merchants of Asterlys!
A dastardly crime committed on a dark night street, "The Night Wagon Attack"!
I, Guido, a private detective, will catch the culprit with flying colors.
Let us join together in the investigation!
My name is Isial, and I am a librarian.
I am in charge of organizing materials and lending out books at the "Great Bookshelf of Rectors" in the Pioneer Bureau.
Actually, there are some books that are not returned easily. ......
Could you please tell them to return it as soon as possible?
I am Manfredo. I am a landowner.
Recently, muskmoths have started to appear in my fields.
This was not the case before. However, recently they have suddenly increased in number, and even if I get rid of them, they keep coming back.
I want you to investigate the cause.
The green pineapple is my dear friend!
I was going to play with it today like I usually do. ......
Suddenly a purple pineapple came and stole my toy!
I tried to go and get it back, but my mom said it was too dangerous. ......
Please help me!　Please punish the purple pineapple for me!
My name is Craif, and I'm an adventurer.
Actually, I have a young son, but in front of him,
I told him that he could do anything he wanted.
And he believed me. ......
It's my fault for talking so big, but I don't want to let him down.
Please, can you lend me a hand?
Adventurers are always in danger.
And I'm in danger too. ...... of my wallet!
So, to get out of this crisis, I'm going to start developing a new product!
I have a good idea!　All we need now is to get the materials!
I need you to go and collect the <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> materials on our behalf!
My name is Andrew. I work for the Pioneer Bureau and study the ecology of the flora and fauna of the Asteria Plains.
In fact, I've been concerned about something recently. There have been reports of sightings of <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/> in the Asteria Plains, which should not be there.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/> is a carnivorous and extremely dangerous monster. If there has been a change in its ecology, it could be troublesome.
I need your help to find out the cause and exterminate <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>.
My name is Sonia. People don't really understand me, but I enjoy collecting insects.
I think insects are the most beautiful things in this world. Like the sparkle of those wings, or the smooth luster of their shells. ...... They are like messengers sent from heaven to warn people of their ugliness and punish them. ......
But there are some insects that I just can't get my hands on alone.
Go gather some giant bugs for my collection!
You still look great. Your star power is growing.
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?
I'm Barni, the world's first adventurer producer.
Today I want to re-produce you as a bandit killer.
I've got a plan for that.
What do you say?　How about we team up again?
Leave it to me and you'll be a bandit killer this time!
I'm Mino. I am the greatest and lone bounty hunter in the world!
There is no better bounty hunter in the world than me.
Because I am the greatest and the lone bounty hunter!
And now that I am a bounty hunter, I challenge you again to a fight!
Let's see who is the better bounty hunter!
My name is Mino!　I am the strongest and lone all-rounder!
Soldier, hero, bounty hunter ....... I've been called many things.
And now I've surpassed them all!
I no longer have any blind spots!
Because I am the strongest and lone all-rounder!
I have evolved, and I challenge you to a match!　Let's go!
Hello, I'm Nene.
Nene's friend Toto is very bad at rock-paper-scissors-scissors.
Toto's face shows it.
I wanted to tell him about it, but he wouldn't listen to me.
So I need an adventurer to help me with rock-paper-scissors.
My name is Belinda ....... I am a fortune teller .......
She doesn't believe in fortune-telling very much, but she is .......
So, ...... I have something I need your help with. ......
I know from my horoscope that bad things are going to happen. ......
I need you to help me prevent it from happening. ......
I'm Belinda, a fortune teller. ......
I did a reading for a girl and I told her something different from the ...... result. ......
Nothing bad is going to happen ....... But I might let her down because of me. ......
I know it's wrong to ask this, but could you please fill in the ...... horoscope for me? ......
Hello. My name is Cecil and I'm a member of the Pioneer Bureau.
The Fiery Pond is a treasure trove of medicinal herbs that many people in the know are familiar with.
Many of the materials used by adventurers for recovery medicines are collected here.
The vegetation in "Fierre Pond" is being eaten away by an overabundance of Kaiser elk.
If this situation continues, the amount of medicinal herbs collected will be affected.
To protect medicinal herbs, please help us defeat the Kaiser elk!

This is Manfredo, who runs a farm in Salamzert.
I have been troubled by the increasing amount of sand that is blocking the sunlight.

My pride and joy, Mount Imagine, can handle most of the way, but the desert is not my favorite place.
She doesn't like sand very much.

I'd like to give it a try. Could you please collect some for me?

I'm Lindsay, your substitute writer.
I've been asked by a client to express my passion not only in the letter itself, but also in the way it looks!　I've been asked to do this for a while now.
So I thought I'd change the color of the ink.
I was wondering if you could pick up some ore called "scarlet ore" that can be found at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>.
I think you can make a red color that won't fade over time. With that ink, you can write passionate letters!

I need you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/> and kill the <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>.

Please investigate the "Sopra's Mountain Path" in the "Melissos River Valley".
It is a natural cave passageway said to have been used by the ancient great man Sopra.
Sopra escaped from the oppressed city with his citizens and crossed the mountain through the passage, knowing the danger involved.
This episode is a popular subject for plays. However, there are many dangers in the area and safety must be ensured.

A new star vein hole has been discovered in the "Dust of No Return" in the Evergreen Desert!
In order to defend Asterlys against the onrushing monsters, participation in the "Defense Battle" will be requested.
During the defense, a barrier will be deployed on the Asterlys Bridge.
Please protect the barrier from being destroyed until help arrives.
We have stationed a team of Pioneer Bureau staff in front of the entrance to Asterleaze to help set up a defense system and to be on the lookout for any possible threats.

Please investigate the "Carsdnor Ruins" on the "Litze Trading Road".
These are the ruins of Fort Carsdnor, which was the front line in the battle against the dragon tribe that once established a great power in the Montenol Valley.
In exchange for defeating the dragon tribe, the fort was completely destroyed and burned down. Because of the remote location of the event, no detailed records remain.
How did the ancient people fight the dragon tribe and how did they win? We want to discover even the slightest clue or trace.
Please conduct the "Carsdnor Ruins Investigation".

I am Alex, a new adventurer. Nice to meet you.
My girlfriend, who I'm adventuring with, gave me an order ...... to go to the "Dawn Worm Fortress" at her request.
But we were stopped by the Pioneer Bureau. They said there was not enough research and that it was too dangerous for us.
That's why she bent the knee. ......
I guess that means they'll let newbies in when the research is more advanced, right?

To the unnamed collaborator. I have an urgent request.
It appears that the defense mechanism of the "Fettered God's Birthplace" is operating beyond its original standards.
We do not anticipate any direct impact on the functionality of the facility, but we cannot overlook even the smallest anomaly.
We believe that an investigation into the cause of the problem is necessary.
Those who can understand this information should respond immediately.

The other day, an adventurer in Salamzert asked me for a cough medicine ...... and apparently it's not just a cold.
Perhaps his throat was damaged by inhaling dust and sand for a long period of time. Ordinary cough medicines are not going to help.
Please go to the "Forest of Lights" and collect the five "Breezia Flowers" needed for the medicine.
If you succeed, you will be of great help to the people of the desert. Thank you in advance.

What I want is the "Robinite ore" that can be found in the "Forest where the rain never stops.

It seems that a bandit group has settled in the "Boroum Ruins. They probably plan to use it as a stronghold and ravage the neighborhood.

But it was too reckless for me to go in alone. Especially the leader of the group, he seems to be very skilled.
Will you help me?

An acquaintance asked me to restore an old bow. This is a famous bow known for its extremely accurate aim!
But it requires rare materials called "sunseed grass" and "scorpo ore," which are no longer used, and can only be found in the "Forest of Lighted Fire.

Hello, I'm Sailor, a spellcaster.
I found traces of a ritual using Imagine in "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon".
The flow of engrams is beginning to be disturbed, and if left unchecked, the monsters in "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" may go on the rampage and attack the surrounding towns and villages.
I will perform the deactivation of the ritual on my end. In the meantime, could you please calm the "<value type="enemyName" id="E002_03_00_03001"/>"?

I'm collecting medicine materials for a request. We're all running around together, but there are so many and different kinds that we're having a hard time.
We could use a little help!　Can you do that for me?
I need you to deliver the "Yosai Stone" that can be collected at the "Boroum Ruins".
The monsters there are so strong that it takes a bunch of us to get to them. We don't have time for that right now.
Can you do me a favor and think of it as helping people?　Please!

I ask you to investigate the "Boroum Ruins" in the "Valley of the Sunflower.
Although it is in the desert, the temperature is stable, and it is known as a site where wild animals gather. However, it seems that vicious monsters are also gathering here, seeing it as a hunting ground.
In order to ensure the safety of the surrounding area, please conduct a "Furious Digging!　Boroum Ruins" to ensure the safety of the surrounding area.
The advanced survey is a challenging request. Please be careful when you take on this challenge.

Hello, my name is Rius, a farm knight of the Duchy of Barnhart.
Did you know that Barnhart Castle has an underground canal that was abandoned long ago?
It is the "Barnhardt Castle Old Underground Canal" located in "Under the Castle of Solitude".
The entrance is supposed to be sealed off, but there is something strange about it. There are stories that the machina that people dumped in the canal in the past has been activated and is going out and destroying the farmland.
I am a farmer, but I am also a knight. I can't just ignore it since it was given to me by the king.

Hello, I'm Panayiotes, a missionary of the Buffalo-Brazilian faith.
Have you ever heard of the "Ruins of the Giant Tower" in the Andorra Basin?　It's a tower-like Buffalian ruin that's still shrouded in mystery.
A curious colleague of mine named Wahlkin has been doing a lot of research on it. Apparently, the Buffalian heritage that hangs around inside the ruins is getting more and more belligerent these days.
Anyway, I brought that idiot Wahlkin back. I told him he was in danger, but he wouldn't listen to me.
I'm going to go get rid of "A Different View!　Can't you just clean up the "Ruins of the Giant Tower" and get us back to a safe situation while you still can?

We are entrusted with the task of compiling the national history of the Principality.
Currently, we are conducting research and investigation of the "Royal Institute of Dorava". It is a negative history for the Principality, but that is precisely why we must leave a correct record for future generations.

I'm getting a request to convey my feelings to a lover in a distant hometown. Romantic, isn't it?
I'm going to go out on a limb and use some special paper. Can you help me gather the materials for it?
I want you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/> in the Evergreen Desert and collect "Sand Split Tree Flowers".
If you make a piece of paper with it, when you open it, a pattern of flowers will appear. It's like when you break sand in the desert and a flower opens.

I would like you to collect "fine dark core fragments" from <value type="enemyName" id="E027_05_00_01001"/> at "Lauraeven Battlefield".
We are trying to develop a new light-blocking smoke screen using the dark engrams contained in these fragments.
The dragon tribe is becoming more active, and we are considering various countermeasures.
We need to contribute where we can. Please help us.

My name is Scherni, a soldier of the Duchy of Barnhart.
I wonder if anyone could collect <value type="enemyName" id="E004_06_00_01001"/>'s "thick and short bicorns"?
The sempai in the barracks are very dexterous. He can make cute little things, so I thought we could make some extra money together.
I've been losing money this month, and I don't mean ......!　I'm in a bit of a pinch with all my expenses!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_06_00_01001"/> should be at the "Rauleben Battlefield". If you defeat him, you will get what you came for.

Chesmach, an engineer in Barnhart's army.
In the past, a prototype model called "Proto Machina" was made in Barnhart's army.
I heard that a component called a "double-helix generator" was used in its power unit, but I've never seen it before.
The material control officer doesn't know about it, and he doesn't have it in stock.
It would be a loss of technology if it were to be forgotten.
I wonder if you could retrieve the "double helix generator" from <value type="enemyName" id="E001_14_00_02001"/>.
Rumor has it that there is still an aircraft operating at "<value type="locationName" id="dng013"/>". Best regards.

Me, Hubby, a fishing enthusiast.
Recently, I've been having a problem with monsters destroying my mountain stream.
The fish are disappearing and the water is being polluted. ...... Everyone in Litze is annoyed.
I've been told that fishing is prohibited because it's dangerous.
The cause is the <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>. It seems that the number has increased too much.
You must defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> and clean up the river!

I'm Baumann, a miner's master in Litze.
Do you know the rock lizards that hang around <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>?
They are, as the name suggests, rock-mimicking monsters. Sometimes they enter the tunnels and sleep pretending to be a rock.
And then some young guys accidentally hit them with a pickaxe. You can imagine what happened.
I want to reduce the number so we don't have a repeat of that accident.
I want you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/> and kill <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>.

I'm Suzette, a mercenary.
I recently discovered the remains of a new Buffalian civilization in the Evergreen Desert.
However, it seems that <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> has made it their territory.
Some birds like to collect shiny things, don't they?　Maybe they are interested in heritage in the same way.
So I was asked to exterminate <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/>, but I don't have enough manpower.
The location is "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>".
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>Help us if you know how to defeat them.

I am Tulka, an adventurer.
There is a tombstone at "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>" in the Evergreen Desert.
It was dedicated to the belongings of an adventurer who fell in the middle of his ambition. ......
The <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/> that roams around the area seems to have broken the tombstone and swallowed it all up.
We cannot allow the peaceful rest of our forefathers to be disturbed in such a way.
I ask you to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/> and return the "relics of a valiant warrior" to me.

<value type="enemyName" id="E001_13_00_01001"/> is a dangerous being whose grudges and delusions have gathered and not properly become an Imagine.

I'm Narai. I'm an antique dealer in Kanaloa.
I deal in valuable items that I find on the coast and in ruins.
Lately, when I'm exploring the area around the Rauleben Battlefield, I keep seeing <value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_00_01001"/>.
They seem to roost in ruins or rocky places.
I know I do, and people in Canaroa sometimes go to the beach. We are in trouble if we are attacked.
Please defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_00_01001"/> and get rid of them.

My name is Paolo. I'm a traveling puppeteer.
I heard that there is a machine-like monster called Makina Fox in the "Castle of the Lonely Shadow" in the West Barnhart Peninsula.
I also make puppets. I think their body structure could be a good clue.
Would you be willing to go out there and kill the Makina Fox and collect the "machine fox parts" for me?
I think I might have an idea for a new form of puppet show. Thank you.

I'm Akka, a miner working in the mines of Litze.
The other day I saw a monster I'd never seen before, and I ran away in a panic.
Rumor has it that they are called "<value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_01_01001"/>" and they are Canny Mook Scouts.
I heard that he is a bad guy beyond comparison to ordinary Mooks.
I can't do my job with any peace of mind.
Can you go to <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/> and defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_01_01001"/>?

I'm Rüben, a dairy farmer from Minsterhorn.
I just received some livestock feed from Litze, and there was a pineapple mixed in with the box.
I wondered if I had bought such a thing, and then it suddenly burst!
It was just a loud noise, though, and I wasn't hurt. But it was a surprise.
It must have been the work of "<value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_01_01001"/>" in "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>". He's famous for being naughty.
I hope he'll be punished so he won't do anything bad.

I am Fritz, a soldier in Barnhart's army.
I went out to investigate the "Lauleben Old Battlefield" and I found something nasty.
I found the footprints of a special little goat, "<value type="enemyName" id="E004_06_01_01001"/>", all over the place.
I have reported this to my superiors, but I am currently on a different mission and must proceed with that.
Can you please take care of it before any damage is done?

We are a group of fishermen from Canaroa.
Recently, the fish we catch are often eaten up.
They eat them in a terrible way. They don't care whether it's the head or the belly, they just take a bite at random and rip it to shreds.
I had them checked out, and they said it was the work of <value type="enemyName" id="E013_02_01_01001"/>, one of the most troublesome crab spiders.
If things continue as they are, we will dry up.
He must be hiding somewhere in the "Rauleben Battlefield. Can you help us defeat them?

If I ask the Knights to help me, it will take a long time.
I wonder if I could ask adventurers to help me defeat them.

I am Barni, the world's first adventurer producer!
I've come up with the perfect plan to make you shine this time.
We're going to take down a stray Machina in Barnhart!
Between you and me, I've heard that there's a Makina that's not under the control of the Knights of Barnhart that appears around the streets and fields.
If we can prevent the damage before it happens, we'll be on our way to becoming a star!
Come on, let's go for it!　We need a Machina Buster to save us all!
Hello!　I'm Pissarri, an adventurer.
Actually, its ....... I'm ...... lost .......
I have a delivery for a soldier of the Duchy of Barnhart, but I don't think I'll be able to give it to him anytime soon if I don't do this.
Please!　Take me to the Duchy of Barnhart!
Please stay with me until I give the delivery to the soldier!
My name is Areni. I am a cook.
When I season the food, it's always very hot. ...... My customers scream and cry and say, "It's so good!
But the other day, a customer didn't seem to find it at all spicy and had a complicated look on his face.
I had never seen such a person before. I was kind of curious.
Adventurer, can you help me find that customer?
I'm Mino!　I am the strongest and loneliest Sargent!
My life-long rival!　I've changed!
I have been trained and disciplined in the Barnhardt tradition of military-style training methods!
I have awakened to the love of my country and my mission to be a shield for my people, and I challenge you to a fight!
I don't know how many times I've done this, but I will not give up on victory!
Let's go!　Sir, yes sir!
I'm Isaac, a miner from Litze.
My boss, Mr. Baumann, is worried about his successor.
His son, Einar, has run away from home and there is no one to take over.
I heard that Mr. Einar had great talent as a miner.
I would like to have a long talk with him.
I would like to meet Mr. Einar.
I am not ......, my name is Guicaro!
I am a new recruit of the glorious Duchy of Barnhart.
Recently, I met my sister ...... who lives in Canaroa, oh, no!　I heard that something strange is happening at my sister's place.
I am on a mission and can't move. But I'm worried about my sister ...... sister.
If possible, could you please look into it, including the cause?
I've come up with a new menu, but I'm having a bit of a problem.
I can't find a supplier of vegetables for the ingredients.
I can't seem to find anyone who grows them around here.
I know it's a long drive, but could you do it for me?
Hi, I'm Rike, a concocter.
I'm looking for someone who can go to the West Barnhart Peninsula to get something for me.
I've been looking for someone who can get me there.
If I can get it, I'll be one step closer to the makeover potion, baboon .......
Wouldn't you be interested?
Baboon ...... would like to hear from you.
I'm trying out a 400 year old weapon process again.
It was just after the founding of Asterlys, but the quality of the weapons was surprisingly high.
It seems that there is a clue in the "fusion of metal and living organisms".
There are those made today with a similar idea.
Can you gather some materials for me as a sample?
My name is Geiler. I may look like this, but I am a seasoned adventurer.
Recently, livestock in this area have been attacked by monsters.
The culprit is <value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_01001"/>. Even I, a seasoned adventurer, find them troublesome.
But I can't leave them alone.
It would be a disaster if someone mistakenly interfered while trying to protect the livestock.

Adventurers,...... I know it's not very bright, but will you listen?
I need you to help me find my fiancé, Yoan.
I heard from a friend of Yoan's the other day. He lost track of him after a fight with a monster in the Montenol Valley. ......
Of course I believe he is alive!　But I need you to help me .......
Please. Find Yoan.
I'm ready to accept whatever the outcome is. ......
The time is full......!
I have long been in pursuit of that man.
He is the one I must capture, even if it costs me my life!　The time has finally come to settle the matter!
I ask for the presence of the appropriate person.
To fulfill my destiny, I ask for your help once again!
I am Aurelie the Sculptor!　I will carve, I will carve!
I have come all the way to Kanaloa to carve a new soul!

I've come up with another new product!
In the desert, where it's dry as a rock, your skin is already dry and cracked.
I want to make a hand cream that will solve all your problems!
What do you think?　How's it coming along?
So, can I ask you to gather some materials for me?
I'm searching for E-chan, who has gone out of the mansion. I'm so tired!
I think she probably ran out of engrams and is lying around. That's what happens to people when they get tired, right? Just like that.
Without them, the master's work will be affected.
Can you help us gather Yi-chan?
We held a special training to strengthen the security force, but some of the new recruits got isolated in the danger zone.
It's a shameful thing, isn't it?
So we're going to go rescue him, but it would be troublesome if he causes secondary damage.
And the big guys are making a lot of noise about it again.

My name is Mordo. I am the manager of the oasis in Salamzat.
The other day, a strange smell was detected in the oasis.
Perhaps the cause is the "Khartoum Ruins". It's connected to a water vein deep underground.

Can you ask them to take them down?
Yo, my name is Iggworth and I hang out at the Coin Pavilion.
My friends and I have a lot of hangouts. This is one of them.
I've been having trouble using Barnhart's lair lately.

Adventurers, can you please help me?
My name is Regina. I'm the heiress of a blacksmith shop.
Actually, my family's business is in trouble. ...... I bought a new and expensive furnace without thinking twice.
I need to make a big win and turn things around.
But the furnace is really good and can produce high quality armor plates.
With this, I want to make it official for the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart.
I was wondering if you could help us to get our family's finances back on track.
Ya-ya, thanks. My name is Rius, a farm knight of the Duchy of Barnhart.
They call me a knight, but I'm just a humble farmer.
So. I heard that the harvest around here has been decreasing recently, and everyone is having trouble.
I have found the cause of the problem, but I need some materials to counteract the problem.
I would like to ask for help from adventurers.
I would appreciate your help in helping the farmers.
I'm just a poor peddler.
My business takes me to and from the Principality of Barnhart frequently. I heard something that caught my attention.
There is a monster in Barnhart that I want you to take down, but it seems to be roaming around in a troublesome place.
I was looking for an adventurer who is good at what he does, and who is also a good talker.
You seem to meet both criteria. Can you do me a favor?
My name is Amado. I'm a merchant......, or maybe I'm just an apprentice merchant.
I'm preparing to start my own business.
I have a plant that I'm thinking of using as my main product, but it seems that monsters appear in the places where it can be harvested.
I'd like you to investigate the monsters and take them down.
I will offer a reward!
It would be meaningless if we don't spend now for the sake of future glory!
My name is Seto, a soldier of the Duchy of Barnhart.

I'm sorry. Could you please go and get the permission letter from your superior?
This is Johnson, the engineer who handles the Buffalo legacy.
There's an antique dealer in Kanaroa named Narai. He's always sending me interesting artifacts.
He has a nose for business, and he picks up artifacts at a pretty good pace.
But recently, he stopped contacting me.
I hope it's just that he can't find his inheritance, but I'm worried that something might have happened to him.
Would you go and check on him?
How do you do?　I'm Nina, the stuffed animal!
The one holding Nina is Rebecca, the owner. Nice to meet you!
Rebecca wants to thank the people who have been so kind to her.
But Rebecca is shy and not very good at talking to people.
So, I'm hoping someone kind will help her.
Please help her. Will you go with Rebecca to thank her?

Welcome. I'm Paulette, the smoker.
I'm Paulette, the smoker, and the new smoking kiln is working great. It doesn't explode anymore, and the smoked flavor is getting better.
Now that that's all settled, I'd like to try using more particular chips.
I heard that there is a good source for kemuri in "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon".
I'm sure they make great smoked fish.
I'd like you to go out and get some, adventurer.

Apparently, this refers to the "<value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" fur that appears in "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>".
If left unattended, the master may say he will defeat it himself. Could you go ahead and defeat it secretly and deliver the "fur woven with jade" to him?

I'm going to make a big difference here, and make my brother look back at me!
I'm going to make an Imagine of my very own, and I need your help.

I don't understand why it crawls when it flies, and why it sounds like it has wings?　And it's so strong that even other monsters can't get close to it, which is really bad, right?
Baron Trima thought that if he displayed his "sharpened sword feathers", it would protect him from monsters and everyone would be safe.
And then, he prepares the reward.
You can't help but think, "That's what a baron is supposed to do," right?
Rumor has it that he is full of benevolence and avoids fighting.

The Order of Buffalia makes a request.
Are you aware that we recently issued a permit for the restoration and improvement of automobiles?
The use of ever more advanced technology has been approved.
The vehicles owned by the Order of Buffalia will also be improved.
It is recorded that easy-to-use metal plates are available in the "Ruins of the Giant Tower, Investigation.
We ask for the cooperation of all adventurers.
Mei, who is helping the team with this and that. Thank you very much for your help.
We're going to have a field day with all the newbie teams.
I was thinking of a prize for the winners, and Mea said to me, "What a great dancer you are!
"Let's show them that there's always someone better than us by giving them some awesome dungeon treasures!"
She said something really naughty like that.
But if we're going to do that, we've got to have something really great, don't we?
I'm sure we'll find something great if we do a "Sopra's Mountain Trail Survey".
I'm sure the new team will be very surprised.
I'm Scherni, a member of the Order of Barnhart.
My superior, Captain Vilmer, is very hard on the priests of Buffalia.
Especially Anelma in Canaroa. She is always fighting with him.
I'm not sure if it's the same thing, but I'm not sure.
I was wondering if he might be in love with Ms. Anelma.
The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to be a good sport.
Can you collect the "crescent daisies" that are blooming at the "Lauraeven Battlefield"?

I am Wilmer, a squad leader of the Barnhardt Knights.
I would like you to collect ore called "Ran-kiritetsu" at the "Rauleben Battlefield".
There is a shortage. I hear that the blacksmiths of Kanaroa are in trouble.
The people of the Duchy of Barnhart are protected by us, the Knights of Barnhart. It is not only in battle, but also in daily life.
We will not let the Order of Buffalia play nice all the time. Especially that female priestess Anelma!
She's a bit pretty and witty, and the residents of Canaroa rely on her, so she's getting on their nerves. ......
Anyway, I'm counting on you!

This is an urgent request from the Pioneer Bureau!
We have confirmed the appearance of the "Shifting Snake Emperor" at the "Dawn Bug Fortress" in the Evergreen Desert.
Due to its influence, the insects that nest in the "Fortress of the Dawn Insects" have scattered to various locations.
If this situation continues, damage will spread to towns, villages, and roads!
The Pioneer Bureau will take care of the insects, but in the meantime, we ask that you help us defeat the source of the problem, the "Shifting Snake Emperor!

I am Narai, an antique dealer from Kanaroa.
The other day, I went looking for a bargain at the old battlefield, but I came across a strange place.
It was an eerie, foggy forest. ...... I heard a tremendous earth-shaking sound coming from behind the trees.
Is that the "dwelling place of the spirits of the damned"? I had heard rumors, but I thought it was just a myth.
If that's the case, then it must have been King Mook that was deep in the woods.
If that thing crawled out of the woods, it would have been too dangerous.
Can't you do something about King Mook?

When the weather is nice, I like to go for a walk, don't you? I often forget about work and go for a walk here and there.
I found the "traces of a waterfall steal" behind the waterfall in the "Minster Hills.

I was surprised, but it was a nice walk.
I want to go exploring again, so can you help me take down a king goblin?

I'm Mordo, the water quality control guy at the oasis in Salamzert.
It's a bad situation.
There is a place called "Yellow Sand Cove" in the "Orbid Plain," and there are people who say they saw "Pridok" there.
It's a large Buffalian legacy, and when it goes out of control, it destroys the whole place, leaving it covered in sand and stones.
It could also affect water sources.
I want you to investigate the "Yellow Sand Cove Free Search" and take down the "Prydawk.

I am Bessemer, a peddler.
Have you ever been to the "Ancient Path of the Falling Sun" in the "Hill of the Divine Watch"?
There is a rumor among my fellow peddlers that a type of ore called "halo ore" can be found there.
Just looking at the pale glow of the ore makes me feel grateful.
I've gone to pick them up a few times myself, but I've been unlucky and haven't been able to find them at all. ......
People say it's easy to find, but that's weird.
That's why I'm looking for a collection of "halo gemstones".
I'm asking for a little more, since the demand for them seems to be increasing.

My name is Inart, a priest of Buffalia.
I visited "Carsdnor Ruins" for the memorial service, but there was an infidel who disturbed my peaceful sleep.
Golemgarde" is actively moving about, disturbing the surrounding area.
This is a tragic place where nameless warriors once risked their lives to protect the people, and fell tragically.
For their sake, we ask that prayers and tranquility be restored.

It has been reported that an "Ice Dread Rattler" has been sighted in the "Sand Diameter of the Sea Moonlight" in the "Valley of the Sunflower.
The surrounding area has beautiful starry skies and is a popular spot for travelers and adventurers to visit. We hear that a sightseeing tour is also planned for the town's residents.
There is a high possibility that the surrounding monsters will turn violent under the influence of the "Dread Rattler of the Ice Sheet," and the situation is extremely dangerous.
I request you to defeat the "Ice Dread Rattler" as soon as possible!

I am Ariane, a perfumer. ...... hakusyo!
Sorry about that. My nose is not feeling well again. ......
I wonder if you know of a place called "Sopra's Trail" in the "Melissos River Basin" in the Montenegro Valley.
The flowers of the "dalzinia" plant there give off a seasonal fragrance!　Heck yeah!
...... my nose can't enjoy it right now.
Can you help me gather some "Dalzinia"?
I'd be happy if adventurers could enjoy the fragrance of the flowers too.

I am Andor. I'm a good fisherman from Asterlys!
I heard a rumor on the wind that fish and shellfish fossils can be found in the "Ghost Valley of the Hidden Moon.
Even if they are fossils, I can't keep quiet when I hear about fish!　And I hear they find some pretty big ones, too!
I want you to go and collect "fossils of old rock whales.
If I can get one, I will display it in the best place in my room!
9 fossils of an old rock whale (Moon Hidden Canyon) / Mineral
I am Aleni, the cook at Asterlys.
The other day, a customer told me about an interesting ingredient.
It's a type of shellfish found on the southern islands, and the more I chewed it, the deeper the flavor developed, making it perfect for my cooking.
I tend to season my food too spicy.
So I thought that if I cooked with just the flavors of the ingredients, I could create a different taste.
Could you please collect "gokkarakara clams" that can be found in the water of the "Ia Mole Reef"?

There is a Gilmy Warrior called "Waterfront Dragon Armor" at the "Shiohae Beach" in Cape Lawehara.
They are called the bravest of the Gilmy pack, and it is said that they are monsters who are allowed to wear special armor.
It may be a sign of their will to protect their friends in their own way.
However, I could not overlook their attacks on human settlements and the damage they cause!
I'm going to evacuate people and check on the other monsters. In the meantime, I ask that you take down the "Dragon Armor of the Waterside.
If this is a battle for protection, we cannot back down!
1 "Dragon Armor of the Waterside" (Shiohae Beach)
There is a strange Girmee called "The Sacrifice Seeking Priestess" in "The Valley of the Hidden Moon".
He repeatedly performs rituals and experiments in order to become stronger, and it is said that he cuts up animals, sprays their blood, and does all sorts of other ghoulish things.
They found traces of it just the other day. If anyone gets involved, it will be a big problem.
I'll take care of the zakos, and you take down the "High Priestess of Sacrifice!
Let's show them that such a thing is not really strong!

There is an amazing mano called "Iron Fist of the Great Wave Crusher" at Ia Mole Rocks in Cape Rawehara.
As the name suggests, it punches and breaks big waves. ......
Blast Archer has received a request to take down the manoa if we can't get close to the herd with this guy!
Please lend me your help as well!　I'll take care of the cronies, so please help us defeat the "Iron Fist of the Great Wave Crasher"!
Let's show them the power of our friendship!

Hi, I'm Sailor, the spell caster. ...... Psst.
Oh, I'm sorry!　I was actually laughing at the monster with the funny name. ......
It's "Picklepecker," which is said to appear at "Shioiwaite Beach" in Cape Rawehara. Pfft!　Hmmm... .......
Because it's "piccalipecker" for "piccalipecker", right?
It's strangely wordy and kind of cute sounding. ......
And anyway!　I need information on this monster. This is a serious request for my "quest!
Please help me defeat "Picky Pecker"!
......Picky, Pecker......Pppp!

There's a skyfish in the "Moon Hidden Valley" called "The One Who Swims in the Light Sky" or something like that.
They seem to enjoy looking down on the fleeing humans from above as they persistently target the peddlers' carts.
All the merchants cried out to him. I couldn't stay silent any longer!
Leave the peddler escort to me. I'll leave the peddler escort to you, and you can run amok as much as you like.
Let's blow away the "Swimmer in the Light and Sky!

There's a Girmee called "The Stiff Arm of the Herd Scattering" at Ia Mole Reef in Cape Lawehara.
He seems to be a great guy who can drive away goblins, ogres, and other higher-ranked people.
He's kind of cool. ......
But if he wants to attack a human village, that's a different story!
The "Stalwart of the Herd" and his minions are said to be acting suspiciously.
We'll protect the village, but you'll have to defeat the "Stiff Arm of the Herd Scattering!
We are not like other monsters!　It's a battle!

This is Glenn the Beat Performer!　I'll be making some noise today!
I've run into a little bit of trouble, and I could use a hand.
It's a guy called "The Breaker of Providence" from "The Forest Where the Rain Never Stops".
I found a group of merchants on the verge of being destroyed by this guy, and I went to help them, but they got all scared.
Everyone was so frightened that they wouldn't let go of me.
I had no choice. This is when you need music!
I'm going to cheer them up with my performance and escort them back to the city!
Use your power to defeat the "Breakers of Providence!　I'm counting on you!

Have you heard of the "Arsenal of the Exiled" in "Fiery Pool"?
It seems that a group of bad bandits have taken up residence there.
It's not just the ruins that are being ravaged, but it's also the scene of a bit of a requiem.
It's also the resting place of the heroes who died defending their country.
It would be a shame to let bandits take over such a place and ruin the name of the beat performers!
I'm sorry, but I'm just a small-time bandit with no skills.
I'm going to need you to go to the "Arsenal of the Exiled and Free Search" and take down the bandit master!

Recently, an increasing number of adventurers have been brought in injured after challenging the "Sandstone Corridor of Khartoum.
It seems that they have encountered a vicious monster that is different from those encountered during normal times.
If monsters were to crawl out of the ruins, the safety of the desert would be threatened.
'Labyrinth!　Sandstone Corridor of Khartoum" is requested.
It will be a difficult investigation, so please be well prepared.
May the God of Buffalia bless you.

The objective is to explore the interior terrain and the monsters that appear, and to understand the overall danger.
Military personnel such as ourselves are not well trained to make comprehensive decisions, even in terms of combat.
Therefore, we are counting on the broad knowledge of adventurers.
This investigation is expected to be extremely difficult.
I hope that someone with solid skills will be in charge of this investigation.
At a dash!　Alston Abandoned Mine
Hey, I'm Panayiotis, a priest from Buffalia. Are you thankful to God?
I'm here to tell you that "Overdraug Alma" has appeared in the "Glimmering Tomb of the Damned.
Draugs are usually trapped in regret, vindictiveness, and other bad feelings. This one seems to be on a rampage, as if he has a grudge against everything in the world.
He must have a lot of things on his mind.
I don't like preaching, but it's a priest's duty to guide a mind that has lost its way. Oh well.
I'm going to ask you to take down Overdraug Alma.
I'll at least say a prayer when you're done. I'll leave it to you.

My name is Tregano. I'm a painter who mainly paints landscapes.
I heard that the "Forest of Light" is thick with glowing plants, and at night it is a fantastic sight.
I would love to paint it, but my daughter Loubel keeps giving me a hard time.
I can't just leave her alone and go out.
I would like to get at least some plants to help me visualize the scene.
Could you please go to the "Forest of Flower Light Free Search" and pick up some "firefly lilies" for me?

Water pollution due to engram disturbance was confirmed in some oases.
Since the "Red Ore Quarry" is located upstream of the water vein, we believe that the overcrowding of monsters inhabiting the area may be the cause.
Water is the root of human life. We cannot allow monsters to destroy it.
Would you be willing to conduct a "Red Ore Quarry Survey" to see what is going on inside the quarry?

I'm Baumann, a miner's foreman in Litze.
I heard the roar of a monster around the Carsdnor Ruins.
The young men are so scared that they can't do their job.
I didn't see him, but it sure made my skin tingle just to hear his voice.
They can't be that strong.
It's a harsh darkness!　Can you take care of the "Carsdnor Ruins" for me?
Only adventurers who know what they're doing can accept this request.

I am Labori. I'm an interpreter of the monsters' language at the Pioneer Station.
And I heard a rumor among goblins.
There are some disturbing movements among the monsters of the "Throne of Mayuki".
I can't translate the details, but I got a bad vibe from it.
Can you please investigate the situation?
If we can prevent the incident from happening, they will understand the importance of a monster interpreter. I'm counting on you!
The Mayuki Palace Investigations.
I am Nenemarina, a soapmaker.
The soap I make seems to be getting popular in Asterlys.
So many merchants are ordering them.
Then I ran out of materials.
I was going to take a break for a while, but the merchant was in a hurry! [I thought I would take a break for a while, but the merchant kept urging me to hurry.
Do I have to rush so much?　I guess it can't be helped.
Adventurer, would you please gather the ingredients for the soap?
My name is Lakaka, a warrior of the forest people.
I lost my precious amulet ring in the Valley of the Coral Rocks.
I want to go and get it, but I'm worried that I don't have it with me. ......
I need a new amulet to help me find it!
However, it's not so easy to find an amulet that grabs me.
Please!　I need you to go look for the amulet I lost!
I am Omaruru, a forest folk. I research old folklore and stories.
I want to leave a proper record for my children, grandchildren, and descendants to come.
But the stories of the past are often vague. For example, there are stories that only say "[a] cave somewhere ["]" .......
I've done some research and I think it might be a place called "Sea God Cave".
I would like you to go there and check it out.
I have a regular customer who wants to try the bento I made for him a long time ago.
But the ingredients for those lunches are no longer available. I can't make them the same way I used to.
But I found some ingredients that I thought would be good substitutes!　Can you pick these up for me?
I'm asking for one for my regulars and their memorable lunches!
I'm Rike, the baboon...... concocter.
I've had a little accident. They confiscated my experimental ingredients for the shape-shifting potion.
I need someone to get me a new one, baboon.......
But I'm going to Cape Lawehala, across the sea.
Who can I ask?
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?　Baboon baboon ......
I'm trying out a 400 year old weaponry formula. ...... I'm taking a break this time.
I got so caught up in work that I had to skip my family appointment.
I've been told that I don't ["]care["], but I've done a bad thing. I want to apologize.
However, I'm not a good talker. I feel that words alone are not enough. ......
So, I'm going to make a gift to thank you for everything you've done for me.
I'd like to make a gift to thank you for all you've done for me.
I'm Regina, the blacksmith's heiress.
As usual, our family finances are on fire .......
I went to the trouble of getting research funds from the Order, but my father used it all up in no time!
Well, I wanted to use the expensive and good tools too, but you know .......
The first condition is to develop and deliver materials that are useful to the Knights of Barnhart.
You haven't done anything yet!
Please!　Cooperate with us before they take away your research funding-!
I am Feodor, a scholar. I am a researcher of meteorology.
I travel around the world collecting weather records in order to make weather forecasts a reality.
This time I'm going to set up my instruments in the Montenol valley.
The ideal location would be at the top of Tower Rock, but it is difficult to get to.
It would be especially difficult if we wander into the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins.
I think the first step is to make an accurate map of the area.
I wonder if you could step over the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins" and let me know what it looks like.
Hello. My name is Melis.
I'm looking for ingredients for cooking.
It's a marine product from Cape Lawehala, so you can't get it in Minsterhorn.
But you adventurers can go there, right?
I really want to get it!　Please, help me!
I'm telling you, it's just a delicious ingredient.
I don't believe in "eat it and you'll fall in love" or any other such lore!
Hey, adventurer!　Please hurry up and lend me your strength!
My name is Russe. I am a scholar who studies and promotes animal husbandry.
Adventurers, you know the butcher Elsi, don't you?
Whenever livestock are harmed, he is the one who rushes out to take them down!
This time, too, he has been attacked by a livestock sheep in Larpal. ......
Please!　Please help us to stop Elsie!
I'm Kainalulu, a restorer from Jubilia.
Unusual for a woodsman, you say?　Haha, I get that a lot!
In the outer continent, a restorer is a rare thing.
Every day, I'm working hard to keep up with all the work that comes my way.
That's all well and good, but I'm running out of materials for restoration work, and that's a problem!
I've got a job that's about to be delivered!　I'm in trouble!　Somebody help me!
I am Hohoi, a hunter from Jubilia.
My friends were attacked by an earth skyfish and several of them are injured.
It shouldn't have been a serious attack, but even the best hunters have been hit.
Without knowing the reason, it is difficult to protect our village.
Can you help us to find out the cause?
I'm Anne, a genius inventor and a future business tycoon!
It's about time I came up with a hit product.
This time, it's a luxury down comforter!
And I've prepared a seamless idea that will appeal to children.
Wow, this is going to be a big seller. We're going to make a killing!
I'll share it with the adventurers, so make sure you have good materials!
I am Mimi Olina.
I'm Mimiorina, and I'm in trouble because the place where we worship the gods has been vandalized.
And when I say "god," I don't mean the god of Buffalia.
I am talking about the sea god who has been worshipped at Cape Lawehala since ancient times.
It seems that monsters have taken away the offerings to the sea god.
Please, please take back the offerings!
My name is Maurili, a medicine man.
Lately, I've been showing signs of an epidemic. I sometimes see people coughing.
I'm going to prepare some medicine while I can.
In such a case, it is important to take action as soon as possible.
I'm going to concentrate on making the medicine, so could you help me gather some materials from the Ia Mole Reef?
I'm Joel, a traveler!
I'm traveling to gain experience in order to join the Order of Barnhart.
I'm not a runaway, I'm a traveler!　Don't get me wrong, okay?
I'm sure the Order will want to recruit me when they see what I can do.
I'd like to talk to someone from the Order, so come with me for a minute!
How are you, kind adventurer?
Actually, I've been unable to receive an item from the blacksmith I've been getting to know so well.
I'm worried that he might be in some kind of trouble.
I'd like to go check on him, but I'm not sure if I can do it alone.
I would be happy if you could accompany me for a little while.
If nothing is wrong, of course, that would be the best. Hmmm.
I have my men training for an expedition to Cape Lawehala.
There are monsters there that are different from those on the Magna Continent.
Don't come back until you defeat them!　I told them, but they seem to be having a bit of a hard time.
It's fine if they don't come back, but we can't leave the town empty forever.
I'm going to go get them. I'm going to collect them.
This is Scherni from the Barnhart Knights.
Captain Vilmer and Anelma, the priestess of Buffalia, are kind of suspicious, aren't they?
Whenever they see each other, they are always fighting. And yet, they are always involved with each other on missions and such.
I thought, "Could this possibly be a coincidence?
I was wondering if this might be a possibility, and then both of them called me.
Since we're here, I thought I'd use the occasion to find out how the two of them are getting along.
Would you mind following me, adventurer?
Hey, I'm Panayote. I am a priest of the Buffalian faith.
Do you know an adventurer named Pissary?
He is famous for getting lost easily. You might have seen him somewhere.
Pissarri is working hard on something he wants to do.
I'd like to ask you to help him.
Well, I'm also set to find Pissary. ......
I'm Bessemer, a peddler.
Actually, I've made a mistake with an important item I'm giving to a customer.
And it's needed for a Buffalian ritual, and even the cultists have been staring at me. ......
I need to retrieve the goods quickly and deliver them back to them.
Please help me before it becomes even more important!　Please!
I am Cecil from the Pioneer Bureau.
There was an incident where the wagons of the merchants' association in Lalpar were attacked and their goods were stolen.
It was done in a very aggressive manner, and it is no exaggeration to say that it was a robbery.
We would like to get our luggage back, but it is not easy to do so when you are dealing with such vicious people. ......
I know it is going to be a long journey, but can you help me?
I am Caponono, living in Jubilia.
I got something from an adventurer I helped before.
I was told that it is a heritage of Buffalia, useful for fishing in the sea.
I am interested in it, but I have no experience in fishing and I don't know how to use it.
Can you help me out a bit?
I'm Mino!　I'm the strongest and loneliest one-man army!

I've been asked by my captain to do a mission for ....... I'm not very good at it, but somehow the mission went well.
I don't know ...... if that's my true ability?
But I can't do it this time!　Absolutely not!
I'm going to have to go to the "Silent War!　I'm going to do the "Soundless City"!
I can't do it! I can't do it! I'll die if I'm a loser like me!

I'm Aaron, from ....... My name is Aaron. I'm a self-proclaimed expert in exploring ruins.
I came across the Iron Coffin at the Ruins of the Giant Tower.
It's a poor Buffalian legacy that has been trapped in ruins for a long time.
Huff ....... I was the one who took all the power and the thought of it head on.
I was blown away so spectacularly that I hurt my back somewhat.
Huff....... I'm sure you can make up for my longing for the past.
I want you to take down the Iron Coffin in the "Free Exploration of the Ruins of the Giant Tower.

I found a rare mineral at a place called "Free exploration at the abandoned mine of the electric leak.
It's called "Dusk Lamp Stone," and it's likely to be used a lot in the maintenance of armaments. Could you collect some and deliver them to me?
I have been summoned by the captain in anger. I've been called to the captain's office for a while because of the bad discipline in the barracks.
I thought I paid ...... for this month's losses, so how did they find out?
Anyway, please go to the "Leaky Abandoned Mine and Free Exploration" to collect the samples!
It looks like it's hard to see because of the gas inside, so please be careful there!

My name is Ferena, a scholar from Salamzart.
Please allow me to request an investigation of the "Sienne Ruins.
According to historical records, a large city of an ancient civilization flourished in that area. Yet, I hear that it was destroyed overnight.
It is said that they were touched by the wrath of the gods of Buffalia, but the details are still unknown.
It is a great mystery in ancient history and one that continues to interest me.
Scholars can unravel the mystery and adventurers can explore the ruins. It is a win-win situation, don't you think?
I look forward to working with you on the "Sienne Ruins Investigation.
"Sienna Ruins Investigation."
I am Berger of the Pioneer Bureau. I am in charge of guiding adventurers through their training and analyzing their strengths.
Have you ever heard of the Cave of Kahuna at Cape Lawehara?
It is an important place in the old beliefs of the region, as well as a rare environment and ecosystem not found on the Magna continent.
The Pioneer Bureau would like to investigate and study it, but the number of adventurers who can venture into the area is quite limited.
We want to find out what kind of adventurers are capable of taking on this challenge.
The rapids!　I request you to challenge "Kahuna's Cave.
I ask you to take on the challenge of "Kahuna's Cave," and I hope that you will be able to successfully complete it!
The Torrent!　Kahuna's Cave
This is Andrew, an employee of the Pioneer Bureau.
I would like to investigate the Ia Mole Reef at Cape Lawehala as part of a monster ecology survey.
The "Swamp Lizard" lives there, but its numbers are increasing rapidly.
Ideally, humans and monsters should coexist in harmony, but if they increase at that rate, their living space in Jubilia and other areas will be threatened.
In order to investigate the cause, could you please reduce the number of "Swanplizzard" to some extent?

This is the research team of Basdolphin University.
They mentioned that they had seen a plant similar to the one in the Asteria Plain in the Forest of Silence.
It seems that "feather dandelions," which carry their seeds on the wind, are growing there.
If we can get a sample, it may prove that "feather dandelion" seeds can cross the ocean.
We would like to conduct a cultivation experiment on the premises, so could you please provide us with a certain number of samples?
Thank you in advance for your cooperation in our research.

There is a Matinee Gob Warrior in the Silent Forest, right?
Matinee Gob Warrior.
The story is that the merchant funded by the baron was attacked by him. All the merchants were safe, but a lot of their stuff was stolen.
Business is all about trust, but Baron Trima thinks that this is only possible after the safety and security of the merchants are assured by eliminating people like the Matinee Gob Warrior.
And then he asks the best adventurers to take them down.
You can't help but think, "Baron Tolima is a real man of his word," right?
You can gossip that he has an economic point of view, too.

Jubilia Tourism Association.
We are currently setting up a tourist billboard as part of our activities, but it has been delayed by a vicious goblin called "The Looter in Broad Daylight".
The adventurers who started the project have been beaten back, and so we have sent out a new request to defeat them.
The monster in question is the "Silent Woods Monster.
The monster in question has made the "Silent Forest" its home, and for some reason is only active during the daytime. It is easy to spot, but it is an extremely dangerous monster, so please prepare carefully.
For the future of the Tourism Association, we ask for your help.
Looters in broad daylight (Silent Forest)
I am researching the "Forest Lamp-Yang Stone" found in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life.
However, the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life" is a sacred place for the forest people, and the number of samples is limited.
We would like to collect new "Forest Lamp-Yang Stones" if possible, but we have no contact with the forest people. ......
Therefore, we would like to ask adventurers who have a good face to help us collect the stones.
Please help us negotiate with the forest people and collect the "Forest Lamp-Yang Stones".
8 Forest Lampolite (in the Zero Zone of the Tree of Life) / ore
We are a group aiming for cultural exchange with the forest people.
We have heard from the forest people living in Asterleaze that they are troubled by the Sowareo okagachiyamma that appears in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life".
This monster is a nuisance that operates in the darkness of the night and preferentially attacks defenseless people who are sleeping.
We cannot afford to overlook the plight of our valued friends, the people of the forest.
Only when we help each other can we truly interact.
Please help us defeat the Sowareo okagachiyamma.

I am a peddler in Jubilia.
After negotiating with the forest people for a long time, I was finally able to enter the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life" for a short while!
However, I ran into a matinee rumblebore there and had a terrible time. ......
Apparently, his cowardly nature is such that he attacks anything he sees.
This is an opportunity to create a new peddling route, but this is not going to help.
Please take down the matinee rumblebores!
They hide at night, so if you want to go after them, please do it in the daytime!

I'm Rasha, the owner of the Litze Mining Association.
Recently, Flame Lapis has been running rampant in the hidden mines of Tomdrum, and I'm having a hard time dealing with it.
It is said that it can melt the ore by spreading fire engrams, so I am very worried.
It's affecting the environment of the mine, and more importantly, it's dangerous.
As a trustee of the union's wallet, I want to do something about it before there is any human or financial damage.
However, it would take a skilled adventurer to take down the miners.
If you have confidence in your skills, I'm counting on you!

I'm Quan, a medicine man of Salamzart.
I have run out of medicinal herbs. I would like to ask you to collect them for me.
It is an ingredient of a stomach medicine called "Manita Vine," which only grows in the "Götterdämmerung of the Sand Sea" area.
It is a very effective stomachic, and is useful for both overeating and overdrinking.
Besides, desert food is very spicy and can easily upset the stomach.
I want to have as much "Manita Vine" on hand as possible.
Thank you very much.

Jeweler's Association of Asterlys.
I would like to ask you to collect "mixed-colored ore gemstones" from the "Misty Sea Sea of Trees, free exploration".
This stone emits multiple colors depending on the light.
However, we have not yet completed an appraisal to determine whether it is a gemstone or just a stone that changes color due to the action of engrams.
We would like to collect the actual stone and clarify its value.
If we find new beautiful gems, our business will be boosted.
Thank you in advance.

My name is Kikihura. I run a blacksmith shop in Ullau Township.
I forge everything from farming tools to weapons. However, I can't accept new requests at the moment.
The number of monsters in the forest has increased, and the number of requests has suddenly increased.
Orders are piling up, but we are running out of materials.
So, can you do me a favor and help me gather some ore?
My name is Toto Hoala!
Adventurer, I need you to go to the Forest of Silence and get rid of the monsters!
I'm having a lot of trouble with a wild boar called the Soiree Tyrant Boar!
There are many of our ancestors sleeping in the Forest of Tranquility, and they are interfering with us day in and day out!
It's really unforgivable!　Please do something about them!
My name is Offutoto. I'm Oftoto, the former gatekeeper of Ullau Township.
In fact, there's someone I've been fighting for a long time.
It's the "Dark Peeping Mouth" monster from the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life.
He's been in hiding for a while, but it seems he's reappeared in the forest. He's a glutton and goes around devouring all the animals and plants in the forest.
It would be a shame for me to let him stay alive.
Please, help me defeat the "Great Mouth that Peeps into the Darkness.
My name is Lilhalia. I'm a doctor by trade.
These days, the forest is noisy. The number of injured people is increasing, and I use a lot of medicinal herbs.
I want to replenish my supply before they run out, but I just remembered something that's been bothering me.
I need herbs that can be found in the "Flowering Trees" area.
It's not for injuries, but just in case. Can you help me?
Do you remember an eccentric man named Bross who was a treasure hunter in the desert?　That's my uncle.
There's a story that he saw a "bloodthirsty dark night wolf" in that desert.
It's an unbelievable monster that even adventurers are wary of.
And yet, when it came to Bros, he wouldn't stop digging holes .......
I dragged him back for the time being, but I couldn't just leave him there.
Adventurers, can you help me take down the "Bloodthirsty Dark Night Wolf"?
I'm Cattleya, a trader. I've got an interesting business opportunity for you.
Have you ever heard of the Rainbow Clock of Galeridge?
It's an antique clock that was made in a village in the Montenol Valley.
It is said to have a mechanism that allows the colors of the dial to change as the time ticks by.
I would like to revive the "Rainbow Clock of Galeridge".
What do you think?　Will you help me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, adventurer.
Do you craft weapons?
I'm doing some serious research at Imagine Labs.
I'm in serious pursuit of crafting weapons.
The Pioneer Bureau is also asking me to do it.
It's a good idea for adventurers to try crafting.
You should try crafting for yourself.　You'll be hooked!
Hello. I'm Poirier, an apprentice at the Imagine Institute.
The Pioneer Bureau and the Imagine Institute are collaborating on a project to let adventurers try their hand at crafting Enhanced Imagine.
Enhance Imagine is an essential part of adventure, and we want you to have a basic knowledge of its crafting.

INFORMATION
Let's return to the city by spatial transfer!
Spatial transfer is a convenient function that reduces travel time. <lf>You can instantly move from the <lf>command menu <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">]</>map to the transfer portal of the <lf>city</span>. You can <lf>go from the map to the transfer portal in the city instantly. <lf>First, open the map screen of the Command Menu.
Battle Imagine for Battle Advantage
Immediately, take the "Battle Imagine" you have just acquired and <lf><span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">]</><span color="Action">]</><lf>go to "Character" > "Battle Build" in the <lf>Command Menu. Let's <lf>equip</lf> in "Battle Build". <lf>Battle Imagineers have a variety of skills, including attack and recovery. <lf>Look for the Battle Imagine that fits your battle style. <lf>After equipping yourself with a Battle Imagine, <lf>talk to "Mury" at the Pioneer Station again. <lf>He will tell you how to become an adventurer.
Let's get ready for adventure!
This time, we will make an expedition to the edge of the "Sea Rhyme Meadow". <lf>Rely on the route guide and quest icons as you proceed. <lf>On the way, you may want to try collecting at the collecting spots. <lf><lf>There are also belligerent enemies in the field. <lf>To avoid getting hurt and falling down along the way, <lf>get some recovery medicine out of the warehouse and put it in your bag. <lf>The warehouse is located at the end of the pioneering station, the girl at the asset management counter will guide you.
Let's make weapons.
If you have the recipe from the Lake Tunnel, you can craft <lf>weapons</lf> by consuming materials and runos at the <lf>rolling sphere kneading ceremony. Select "Weapon Crafting" in the <lf>Turning Sphere Crafting Ritual.
Did you use a new skill?
You can check <lf>the skills you have learned</lf> on the skill board in the command menu <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">]</>. If you <lf>acquired several skills, you can replace them in the "Battle Build" to <lf>customize your fight to your liking.
Weapon recipes obtained
You may <lf>get</lf> a recipe for a weapon or an Imagine when you complete a mission, for example. With <lf>recipes, you will be able to <lf>craft weapons, battle imagines, and enhance imagines. <lf>After you have registered as an adventurer, you can visit the "Transfer Ball Training Ritual" in town.
Use of Wish List
The "Wish List" is a function that <lf>notifies you when materials necessary for crafting become available and displays recipes on the main screen. <lf>Since you can add recipes to your wish list from the crafting screen and other screens, <lf>please add recipes you are interested in as you go. <lf>Also, if you want to check the collection status at any time, you can display it on the HUD. <lf>Display the <lf>list</lf> by going to "Quests" > "Wish List" in the command menu and <lf>check the checklist of the recipes you wish to display in the HUD. Up to three lists can be displayed on the <lf> HUD at a time.
Weapons board obtained.
I got the recipe for the "Dragon Nail" series of weapons and the <lf>Adventure Board for Weapons as a reward for the quest. <lf>The adventure board for weapons is an efficient way to collect materials for weapons by completing <lf>the assignments since the assignment rewards are materials for weapons. <lf>Let's start by completing the "Dragon Nail" board's assignments.
DRAGONNAIL" series materials<lf> - Fossil of Giant Fang: reward for clearing "Additional Research" <lf> - Goblin Fang: obtained by defeating goblins in "Free Search" <lf> - Circular Stone: obtained from mineral extraction points<lf> Only the fossil of Giant Fang can be obtained from the Adventure Board. Only the fossil of Giant Fang can not be obtained from the Adventure Board. <lf>Collect the materials by stepping on the "Giant dragon's claw marks, additional investigation".
Enemy Combination Techniques
Enemies sometimes cooperate in groups and use special techniques. <lf>If you see any suspicious movements, be sure to defeat them with priority.
Target - Attack
Press <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">]</> to attack. <lf>(You can press and hold to attack continuously.)<lf>If you press <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Lockon"/><span color="Action">]</> while an Enemy is nearby, you can <lf >You can fix the target of the attack. <lf><lf>Use <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Dodge"/><span color="Action">]</> to avoid attacks while fighting. <lf>Avoid <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Dodge"/><span color="Action">]</>and jump <span color="Action">[</><key color ="Action" action="Jump"/><span color="Action">]</> consumes <lf>stamina. Be careful not to <lf>lose stamina, as you will not be able to perform actions that <lf>consume</lf> stamina.
<span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Jump"/><span color="Action">]</> will make your character <lf>jump. <lf>Jumping consumes stamina only during combat.
The Route Guide will guide you to your "next destination". <lf>While the main quest is in progress, the route guide for the main quest will have <lf>priority. <lf><span color="Action">[</span><key color="Action" action="dash"/><span color="Action">]</span><span color="Action">[</key color=" Action" action="Move"/><span color="Action">]</>press to dash and use it to follow the <lf>route guide.
If you want to view the route guide for other quests, go to <lf>"Quests">"Ordered Quests" in the <lf>command menu and select the quest for which you want to view the <lf>route guide.
Press <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="dash"/><span color="Action">]</>while pressing <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Move"/><span color="Action">]</>press to dash. <lf>Take advantage of the fact that you do not use stamina when you are in a non-combat state.
Press <span color="Action">[</span><key color="Action" action="Skill1"/><span color="Action">]</span> during combat to activate tactical skills. <lf>The tactical skills that can be activated vary by class, and <lf>most skills have an "interval". <lf>Since the skill cannot be used during the interval, <lf>use the tactical skill at the right time.
Interacting <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">]</>to <lf>get</lf> material items by <span color="Action">[</key><key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">]</>interacting with the field's collection spots. <lf>Material items are available. <lf>The spots for collecting materials are located on the ground, rocks, etc.<lf>The items available at each of these spots are different. <lf>After a certain amount of time has elapsed, <lf>the spot will become available again</lf>, so if you want to collect a lot of items, <lf>wait a while before visiting the spot again.
Once you have collected a spot, you will not be able to collect it for a while, but <lf>after a certain period of time or when you return to the city, you may find that you can <lf>collect it again. If you <lf>have exhausted the collection spots on the field, <lf>return to the city once more.
Characteristics of the Aegis Fighter
The Aegis Fighter will hold <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]</>while in battle, <lf>holding <span color="Action">[</key><key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]</>will cause the shield to be held in a "shield guard. While pressing [<lf>Shield Guard If you are attacked by an enemy while <lf>shield guarding</lf>, your HP will not be reduced, but <lf>your shield gauge</lf> will be reduced.
If <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">]</>is entered immediately after blocking an attack, <lf>a powerful counter-slash can be activated. can be used.
Twin Striker Characteristics
Twin Striker's <lf>"Combo Gauge" increases with each attack. The higher <lf>this gauge is, the more damage it inflicts, but <lf>the gauge resets when the attacker's HP is reduced beyond a certain level, so use <lf>evasion and HP absorption buffs</lf> to fight.
Characteristics of Blast Archers
Blast Archers can increase their <lf>"Buff Charge Gauge (BC Gauge)" by attacking and use the <lf>class action "Cure Arrow". The <lf>BC Gauge increases more when there is a <lf>weak point attack or <lf>critical hit on a specific area, so depending on the situation, <lf>lock on<span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Lockon "/><span color="Action">]</></>Actively attack while using <lf>with or without <span color="Action"></><key color="Action" action="Lockon"></key>.
Characteristics of Spellcasters
Spellcasters consume EP and use powerful skills. <lf>They can fire powerful skills in rapid succession until they run out of EP, so <lf>when the moment is right, attack at once. <lf>EP is recovered by using <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action"></span> and some class skills, or after a certain amount of time in <lf>no combat state The smasher will recover after a certain period of time in a <lf>non-combat state.
Smasher Characteristics
The heavy smasher can <lf>consume</lf> bullets to attack with various skills when there are remaining bullets in the cartridge. The number of <lf> bullets consumed depends on the skill. You can <lf>use all the bullets and then reload with <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]</>, or you can <lf>use the remaining bullets with < span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">]</>with remaining ammunition, but you can also reload by holding down <lf><lf><span color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">. <lf><lf>If you reload with all bullets used, it will be a quick reload and you will <lf>reload faster and have 2 more bullets. <lf>Manage your ammunition count to make the most of quick reloads.
Transfer Portals
<lf>Using "transfer portals" located in various parts of the city or in the field, you can <lf>move instantly between each transfer portal by spatial transfer. <lf>You must register the portal to use it, so <lf>when you find a new portal, <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action ">">]</> to register the <lf>portal.
Registering the Forwarding Portal
The recipient of the delivery will be waiting near the transfer portal, so <lf>register any portals that you have not yet registered. <lf>Portals can be used for travel within the city, and you can also return <lf>directly to each portal from outside the city, making your adventures easier.
The asset management counter takes care of the adventurer's assets. <lf><lf>Warehouses can store items, weapons, costumes, etc., and <lf>you can also sell items that are no longer needed. <lf>Items that are not used during the adventure, such as material items, are <lf>automatically sent to the warehouse when acquired. <lf>You can also <lf>change your character's equipment in "Battle Build". <lf>Before going on an adventure, it is a good idea to stop by to organize your bag.
In the "Rush Battles" held in the arena, you can obtain rewards for winning, such as ability plugs that can be used to <lf>enhance</lf> your weapons. <lf>Multiple difficulty levels are available, and the higher the <lf>difficulty, the better the rewards.
If there is a difficulty level that you cannot complete, <lf>go to "Mission" in the command menu to complete other missions and craft <lf>new weapons. Equipping <lf> more powerful weapons will make it easier to conquer.
You can compete with other players for the time it takes to complete the mission. <lf>You can also earn special rewards for each time you beat the specified time. <lf>Try again and again by preparing your weapons and enhancing imagines. <lf><lf>Time attack rankings can be checked on the "Ranking Board" located in <lf>the city.
At the Imagine Laboratory, you can craft <lf>Enhanced Imagine (E-Imagine) and other items by consuming materials and Lunos. <lf>E-imagine can be equipped to increase parameters and strengthen adventurers with <lf>given abilities. <lf><lf>E-Imagine comes in the form of five different symbols. <lf>The E-imagine we are about to create is the "Three Leaves" symbol. <lf>Each symbol can equip one E-imagine, so <lf>when you get a new E-imagine recipe, <lf>pay attention to the shape (symbol) of that Imagine.
When certain conditions are met on the field, <lf>"Challenge Quests" will occur and Named Enemies will appear. <lf>There are <lf>various conditions for appearance, such as continuing to hunt a specific Enemy or appearing only at night. By all means, let's look for them. <lf><lf>In addition, you may be able to obtain <lf>"Ideas" when you defeat Named Enemies. <lf>Gather "Idea" and other materials to craft "Battle Imagine" and summon <lf>formerly powerful enemies</lf> to help you advance in battle.
Crafting the Battle Imagine
In order to craft "Battle Imagines,"<lf>you will need specific materials for each Imagine. <lf>First, you will need the "Idea" of that particular Imagine, but you may also need other materials obtained by gathering or defeating the Imagine.
Imagine's Abilities
Crafting an Imagine may grant <lf> abilities. The <lf> effect values of the abilities that may be granted and their probability are <lf> fixed for each Imagine's abilities.
Battle Lock Wall
Battlelock Walls, which hold players back in dungeons, can be <lf>unlocked</lf> and advanced by achieving <lf>conditions such as defeating specific enemies. If you are unable to <lf> advance, try defeating the surrounding enemies.
Some of the player's attacks have attributes. There are six types of <lf>attributes: fire, ice, lightning, earth, light, and darkness. By stacking attacks with <lf>attributes, you can cause <lf>attribute status abnormalities on the enemy.
Each time an enemy is attacked with an attribute, the value of the attribute accumulates, and when the <lf> amount is exceeded, the attribute of the attribute with the highest number of attributes will cause an abnormality. <lf>(Attribute values accumulate even if different attribute attacks are applied.)<lf>There are three levels of attribute abnormalities: Lv1, Lv2, and Burst, and the effect increases as the <lf>level progresses.
<span color="Emphasis">Fire attribute status abnormalities</><lf>At Lv1 and Lv2, the fire is engulfed in flames and its HP is gradually reduced. <lf>When it becomes a fire burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the <lf>burst finish, inflicting heavy damage.
<span color="Emphasis">Attribute status abnormality of the ice attribute</><lf>Lv 1 and 2 will cause the target to be covered in ice and its movement speed will be reduced. <lf>When the target is in an ice burst, it is covered in a block of ice and cannot move when the burst occurs<lf>The ice block explodes in the burst finish, inflicting heavy damage.
<span color="Emphasis">At Lv1 and Lv2, an electric current runs through the body and blocks the action with a certain probability. <lf>When it becomes a lightning burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the <lf>burst finish, dealing <lf>massive damage and paralysis at the same time.
<span color="Emphasis">Earth attribute status abnormality</><lf>In lvl 1 and 2, clumps of earth cling to the body, increasing the damage dealt. <lf>When it becomes an earth burst, it is covered in clods of earth and cannot move when a burst occurs, and the clods explode at the <lf>burst finish, inflicting heavy damage.
<span color="Emphasis">Attribute status abnormalities of the light attribute</><lf>Lv 1 and 2 will be covered in light and deal less damage. <lf>When it becomes a light burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the <lf>burst finish,</lf> inflicting <lf>massive damage as well as continuous HP recovery to surrounding players.
<span color="Emphasis">Darkness attribute status abnormality</><lf>In Lv 1 and 2, darkness clings to the player and <lf>makes the attack miss with a certain probability. <lf>When it bursts into darkness, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and <lf>a large explosion occurs when the burst finishes, dealing <lf>massive damage and simultaneously causing an HP leak condition.
Attack Prediction
Some enemies have predictive signs for their attacks. <lf>When the predicted area of attack appears, that is where the attack will come, so <lf>basically focus on avoiding the attack.
Gestures to other players
You can gesture to <lf>other players by making a gesture from the Communicate menu.
Climb
Some walls can be climbed by climbing. <lf>Approach a climbable wall and type <lf><span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">]</> to hold onto the wall. <lf>In addition, entering <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="MoveFront"/><span color="Action">]</> will make you climb. <lf><lf>The places where climbs are possible are indicated by icons on the minimap. <lf>If you cannot find a way to proceed, look for it.
Supplied items
During a mission, you will not be able to use items in your bag, but only <lf>supplied items</lf> that are given to you by the Pioneer Bureau. <lf>Supplied items can be used in the item palette or registered in the <lf>shortcut ring</lf>. <lf>Remaining supplied items will be collected at the end of the dungeon. <lf><lf>* Some missions can use some of the items in the bag.
The Engram Cannon is a Buffalian legacy that concentrates the surrounding engrams and fires them at the <lf>enemy. It is immensely effective against <lf>enemies. <lf>When it is glowing blue-white, it can be used for boarding. <lf>When it is glowing red, it is charging and cannot be used. <lf><lf>■ Operation method<lf>Boarding and disembarking: <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">]</><lf>Adjusting the firing direction: <span color="Action">[</key color="Action" action="CameraControl"/><span color="Action">]</><lf>Firing: <span color="Action">[</key color=" Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">]</><lf>Be aware that you will take damage if you are attacked while boarding.
You can also receive quests from the quest receptionist or people in town. <lf>If you wish to display route guides other than the main quest, go to <lf>"Quests">"Ordered Quests" in the command menu and check the "Show in HUD" box and the <lf>"Show Route Guide" radio button for the quest you wish to display the <lf>guide for.
Quest Exclusive Items
Quest-exclusive items are <lf>special items that can only be obtained during the course of a specific quest order. They cannot be <lf> placed in your bag or warehouse, nor can they be sold. <lf>You can only see how many items you have in your possession in your quest journal or HUD display. <lf>Please note that when you discard a quest, the quest-specific items will also be discarded, and you will have to start collecting them all over again<lf>even if you re-accept the quest.
About Classes
In the "Character" > "Battle Build" command menu, you can change your <lf>class</lf> by switching your equipped weapon to another type. <lf> Class change is available in the city, field, and free exploration map. <lf>(You cannot change classes while being viewed as an enemy.)<lf><lf>It is also now possible to receive "Class Quests". <lf>You can learn about <lf>classes with a class partner chosen for each class, so <lf>whether you choose to adventure in your current class or change classes, <lf>you should first take a class quest at the Pioneer Station.
Further Contents
This is the end of the main quest. <lf>After that, please enjoy <lf>playing and searching for various contents that exist in various places.
If you are not sure what to do, please talk to the receptionist at the <lf>Pioneering Bureau</lf>. <lf>Subquests of recommended levels will <lf>lead you to new content.
How to do the gesture
Select the gesture you want to perform from the talk mode <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="ChatMode"/><span color="Action">]</>, or <lf>call up the gesture registered in your shortcut You can take a <lf> gesture by calling Communicate with other adventurers using <lf> gestures.
Equipping Enhance Imagine
Equipping an Enhance Imagine increases its ability value, increases resistance to debuffs and reduces damage from <lf> attribute attacks through a special effect called <lf>Ability. Equip the <lf>"Enhance Imagine" in the <lf>"Character" > "Battle Build" in the <lf>Command Menu.
Equipping Enhance Imagine will increase your ability values, increase your resistance to debuffs and reduce the damage of <lf> attribute attacks through a special effect called <lf>Ability. Equip <lf>"Enhance Imagine" in <lf>"Character" > "Battle Build" in the command menu.
Higher levels of equipment, such as Enhance Imagine, may <lf>apply a "Level Sync" to each of them. <lf>"Level Sync" on equipment means that when the level of the equipment is higher than the <lf>player's class level, the equipment's parameters are <lf>temporarily restricted. <lf>(E-Uri Uribo will show its true value from class level 5)<lf><lf>If the player's class level is equal to the equipment level, <lf>the full power of the equipment will be available, so <lf>if you get strong equipment but do not feel that you are getting stronger, <lf>you should try to raise the class level. You may want to try raising your class level.
Because the enhanced imaginings crafted this time are high level, there is a possibility that <lf>"level sync" will be applied to them when they are equipped. <lf>"Level sync" means that when the <lf>equipment level is higher than the player's class level, the equipment's parameters are temporarily <lf>restricted. <lf>(E-Uri Uribo will show its true value from class level 5.)<lf><lf>If the player's class level is equal to the equipment level, the full power of the <lf>equipment will be available, so <lf>if you get strong equipment but do not feel that you are getting stronger, you should try to increase the <lf>class level. You may want to try raising your class level.
Enhance Imagine comes in the form of five different symbols, and you can <lf>equip only one Imagine of each symbol. <lf>When you get a new recipe, <lf>pay attention to the shape of its Enhance Imagine.
Adventurer Rank Up Board
Congratulations, you are now registered with the Pioneer Bureau as an Adventurer. <lf>But as an adventurer, you are still just a chick. <lf>First, let's advance your Adventurer rank by completing the tasks listed on the "Adventure Board. <lf><lf>The HUD's list of quests to be ordered is <lf>a quest for each press of <span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="QuestHudChange"/><span color="Action">]</>, You can <lf>switch between the Wish List and the Adventure Board. <lf>Show the assignments you want to proceed with now.

Weak Point Attributes
Some weapons have attributes. <lf>When an enemy's weak point attribute matches the weapon's attribute, the <lf>damage notation will change, indicating that the damage dealt has increased. Since <lf>you can defeat the enemy more quickly by striking the enemy's <lf>weak point attribute,<lf> you should also be aware of the <lf>weapon's attribute.
Now it's time to go to the field!
In the field, a variety of enemies await you. <lf>Yellow alerts will appear when an enemy spots you, and red alerts when it is identified as an attack target, so <lf>be careful not to be caught by surprise</lf>.
Also, by looking at the nameplate of an enemy, you will be able to <lf>know</lf> its name and level. Enemies of a higher level than you will be less likely to damage you <lf>even if you attack them</lf>, and if the level difference exceeds a certain level, <lf>you will not be able to damage them at all</lf>. <lf>In particular, if you see a purple nameplate, avoid it.

Burst Bonus
When an attribute accumulation value is accumulated and a burst occurs, <lf>a certain amount of time will be <lf>burst bonus time</lf>. During the <lf>bonus time, the damage dealt will be increased, and there is also a bonus that <lf>increases the damage dealt by Battle Imagine</lf>, allowing you to deal damage more efficiently with <lf>Battle Imagine</lf>. <lf><lf>In addition, during the burst bonus time, the <lf>Burst Finish Gauge is increased by accumulating attribute accumulation values. <lf>When the gauge accumulates above a certain level, the Burst Finish Level is increased and the effect of the <lf>Burst Bonus Finish can be increased. <lf>Aim for high damage by increasing the Burst Finish Level!
Chain attacks can be performed by giving a series of quick attacks in quick succession. <lf>A bonus of increased damage will occur if you connect more chains, and if you connect up to a certain number of chains, you will receive "Continuous HP recovery" and <lf>"Damage reduction" effects that are advantageous to the player.
The number of chains is shared by you and your allies in the party. <lf>Be careful not to be too far from the player who is the party leader, otherwise you will not be able to receive the <lf>chain effect. <lf>The chain time that can be used to connect chains becomes shorter and shorter as the <lf>chain count increases. <lf>In addition, if a chain is interrupted after a certain number of chains are connected, the chain will not occur for a certain <lf>period of time. <lf>Once you start a chain, be <lf>conscious of connecting the chain as much as possible.

While jumping, you can perform a <lf>2-step jump by stepping on the Enemy by performing the jump again. <lf>Melee classes such as Aegis Fighter and Twin Striker jump <lf> straight up, while <lf>remote classes such as Spellcaster and Blast Archer jump backward. <Although it consumes more <lf> stamina, <lf> melee classes can make assault attacks with an altitude bonus, and <lf> remote classes can distance themselves from the Enemy in one fell swoop.
Ease of being targeted by the Enemy
Damaging an enemy or healing an ally increases the <lf> enemy's targetability. The <lf>enemy will attack the player with the highest targetability. Some attacks are more likely to increase <lf>their targetability, and some are less likely to do so, so you should control who is targeted by the <lf>enemy by watching the situation.
Ground Targets

Shared Abilities
<lf>Because you have reached class level 30, <lf>the shared ability slots for Battle Builds have been opened up. <lf>Shared abilities learned in other classes can now be set in the <lf>Shared Ability Slot. If you <lf>have not yet experienced other classes, <lf>this is a good opportunity to experience other classes.
There are sometimes pink nappies, <lf>happy nappies</lf>, standing in the field. <lf>It may be a good thing to find many of them. <lf>When exploring the field, look for them carefully.
Treasure chests placed in fields and dungeons, as well as those found when <lf>enemies are defeated, can be opened by <lf>interacting with them. <lf>Various items such as consumable items and equipment are contained inside<lf>The more luxurious the appearance of the treasure chest, the more luxurious its contents are likely to be. <lf>If you find a treasure chest during your adventures, you should open it proactively.
Battle tips for beginners
■Use directional derivatives of normal attacks<lf>Derivative attacks can be launched by inputting the move key, etc., in conjunction with a normal attack. <lf>Each class has its own characteristic derivative attack, so check the <lf>Skill Board. <lf>The vanguard class also has an attack method called "assault attack. <lf>Use it according to the situation.
<lf>Watch the movement of the enemy<lf>Because preliminary actions may occur before a powerful attack, <lf>observe the movement of the enemy carefully. <lf>Do not just avoid it, but also aim for just evasion or try to use your <lf>guard well. <lf><lf>■ Be aware of buffs and debuffs<lf>There are <lf>various types of buffs that can strengthen you and your allies and debuffs that can weaken the Enemy. <lf>Some are powerful enough to change the battle situation, so <lf>know the effects of each and use them to your advantage.
<lf>To attack an enemy's weak point<lf>you can make combat easier<lf>by using its attributes to efficiently inflict damage by attacking its weak point attributes or by generating <lf>attribute status abnormalities</lf>. <lf>First, be <lf>aware of the attributes of your weapons, battle imagines and tactical skills. <lf><lf>■ Consider when to use Battle Imagines and ULTs<lf>The longer the interval between them, the more effective they are and <lf>the greater the impact they can have on the battle. <lf>Use them when the battle situation calls for it and use them here and there.
Intermediate Battle Tips
<lf>Be aware of the enemy's targets<lf>It is easy to become the enemy's target when attacking or recovering. <lf>The vanguard should be careful that the target does not go to the rear guard, and the rear guard should be careful not to become the target. If you do not want to be <lf>targeted,</lf> carefully watch the color of the enemy alert and attack when it is yellow, or reduce the frequency of <lf>attacks.
■Check the abilities of your equipment<lf>Check the special effects and attributes of your weapons and the abilities of your imager. <lf>Even the same piece of equipment may have different special effects and abilities<lf>. The <lf>effects of multiple items of the same ability will add up. Try to find equipment with <lf>abilities that are more suitable for your class and set it up. <lf><lf>■ Be creative with your battle builds<lf>Set up class abilities that can help you with things you are not good at, or set up battle imageries that do <lf>lower damage but can add abnormal conditions.
<lf>At class level 30, you can use the shared ability slots and set <lf>shared class abilities of other classes. <lf>Gain access to the shared class abilities of various classes to expand your <lf>battle horizons.
Advanced Battle Tips
■Connect Chains<lf>The more chains you have in your party, the shorter the time you can connect <lf>chains. <lf>But if the number of chains exceeds a certain number, a buff that strengthens the <lf>party will be applied, so be aware of the <lf>time remaining to connect chains.
2<lf>When attacking a mission with a party, try to build a battle build with <lf>party play in mind. <lf>Because you can ask other players to compensate for your weaknesses, it is a good idea to create a structure that allows you and your party members to utilize your strengths and compensate for each other's weaknesses by <lf>forgoing defense and specializing in attack, or <lf>specializing in buffing and recovery.
During the <lf>Burst Bonus, not only do you accumulate attribute accumulation values to increase your <lf>Burst Finish Level, but you also receive a damage bonus multiplier for <lf>attribute attacks. <lf>Attribute attacks by Battle Imagine will increase the <lf>bonus multiplier even more,<lf> so be proactive and aim for it.

Enemy Rush" is an event that occurs during a mission. <lf>If one member of your party enters the area where the event starts, <lf>the rush will start and the Enemy will appear infinitely for a certain period of time. <lf><lf>Since the enemies that appear in the event tend to drop treasure chests, you should kill as many of them as possible within the <lf>time limit!
Enemies that are in a "lucky state" will always drop <lf>materials and treasure chests. <lf>(In some cases, more than one treasure chest may be dropped.)<lf><lf>There is no difference in strength between "Lucky Enemies" and normal enemies. <lf>When you find a "Lucky Enemy", be proactive and defeat it!
Weapon special effects
Weapons have "special effects" with different rarities. <lf>There are three rarity levels of special effects: Legendary, Rare, and Normal, and the higher the rarity, the more unique effects you can expect. <lf><lf>Also, you can replace the special effect every time you <lf>break the limit, even if you have broken the limit to the maximum. <lf><lf>Gather many weapons and carefully select better effects to achieve <lf>higher difficulty content.
Weapon Limit Breakthrough Special Effects
Weapons have "special effects" that can be released when the weapon is pushed to its maximum limit, giving the weapon <lf>status-up effects</lf>. <lf><lf>Even if a weapon has been maxed out, the special effect can be replaced each time it is maxed out. <lf><lf>Gather as many weapons as you can to push the limits and achieve <lf>higher difficulty content</lf>.

<lf><lf>The "Warrior God's Training Ground" is a very difficult mission to conquer. <lf><lf>This mission requires a party of six players to be assembled in advance, and <lf>you must also make full use of "mission-specific skills" in battle. <lf><lf>First, let's practice by going to the "Tutorial" ><lf>"Action Tutorial" on the mission screen.
<lf><lf>"Claw Fang Shattering Bullet" is a mission-specific skill that can <lf>force an enemy to interrupt its action</lf> by hitting it against certain attacks. <lf><lf>It fires a shockwave in front of you if you are a close class, and fires a high-speed bullet that can reach a certain distance if you are a <lf>far class. <lf><lf>In addition, interrupting an enemy's action will increase the <lf>"Mission Skill Gauge" by a lot. <lf>Because the gauge of party members can also be increased, it is important to <lf>continue to increase the gauge by applying skills in cooperation.
Practice "Nail Fang Shattering Bullet" first. By pressing <lf><lf><span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="ContentAction1"/><span color="Action">]</>, <lf>the close range class will release a shockwave in front of you, and the long range class will release a shockwave in front of you. If you are <lf>long-range class, it will fire a high-speed bullet that reaches a certain distance. <lf><lf>Hitting with a claw-fang shattering bullet against certain attacks <lf>forcibly interrupts the enemy's action and increases the <lf>"Mission Skill Gauge" by a large amount. The <lf> gauge is needed to activate the "Guardian Heavenly Shield," which will be practiced next.
The "Shield of Heaven" is a mission-specific skill that can be activated by consuming the "Mission Skill Gauge" and can nullify all <lf>attacks. <lf>(You can extend the time of disabling by holding down the activation button.)<lf><lf>It consumes 50% of the gauge to activate the skill once. <lf>The gauge can be increased depending on your actions during the battle, <lf>especially if you interrupt an enemy's action with "Claw Fang Shattering Bullet"<lf>The amount of the gauge increase will be more. <lf>While maintaining the amount of <lf>gauge, activate the "Guardian Heavenly Shield" against powerful attacks and attacks that cannot be <lf>avoided.
Next, practice "Shogouten Shield". By pressing <lf><lf><span color="Action">[</><key color="Action" action="ContentAction2"/><span color="Action">]</>, <lf>the mission skill gauge increased by the "Claw Fang Shattering Bullet" mentioned earlier will be used. Consumes the mission skill gauge for 50% of the <lf>gauge, and nullifies all attacks of the Enemy. <lf>(You can extend the time of disabling by holding down the gauge)<lf><lf>Other gauges will be increased according to your actions during the battle. <lf>While maintaining the gauge amount, activate the "Guardian Heavenly Shield" against powerful attacks and attacks that cannot be <lf>avoided.
Weapon Aura
When a character's battle score exceeds a certain level, <lf>weapons will display an aura. There are six levels of <lf>weapon auras depending on the battle score. <lf>Increase your battle score and show off your weapon aura. <lf><lf>*The battle score at which the <lf>weapon aura switches changes when the maximum class level is increased.
 <lf><lf>Collected Guardian Seals can be exchanged for luxurious items at the Souvenir Exchange. <lf><lf>Both the exchange items and the Mamoru Marks do not have an exchange period, so <lf>think carefully and do not rush to exchange them.
In this mission, if you pass over the "poison pool,"<lf>you will be affected by a poisonous condition and your HP will decrease rapidly. <lf>Either equip yourself with an E-imagine that is resistant to poison or <lf>avoid entering it.
If you touch the "exploding spikes," they will burst and you will <lf>take damage. <lf>The exploding spikes will return to normal over time. <lf>Attacks cannot destroy them, so <lf>stay away from them as much as possible.

The beaches of Asterlys are now! <cf> It's at its best!
The beach is just down the stairs. <cf>Come on, come on, come on!
It's just for now! <cf> Enjoy your summer in Asterlys!
<cf>Have you been to the beach? <cf>There's a lot of excitement. You'll be amazed!
You'll see something completely different from what you're used to.
You can walk down the stairs to the beach! <cf>You don't want to miss a moment of summer!
Look, look, look! <cf>I got this outfit from the "Souvenir Exchange"!
Pretty cute, right?　It's only for a limited time, so <cf>you'd better get to the "Souvenir Exchange" as soon as possible!
There's a king collector collecting <cf>"Merry Red for the Holy Night" right now!
I suggest you <cf>go to the "Souvenir Exchange" because you can get a gift in exchange for what you collect!
Did you hear that? <cf>The Duchy of Barnhart has been attacked by dragon tribes!
And that's not all.
Rumor has it that <cf>the holy place of the Order of Buffalia</cf> has also been attacked!
Did you hear that? <cf>The story of the incident in the Duchy of Barnhardt: ......
It wasn't just attacked by dragon tribes. <cf>The duke was assassinated. ......
Apparently the assassin escaped and hasn't been caught yet. <cf>This is an outrageous story.
The dragon tribe attacked and the appearance of vicious monsters......
It's getting to be a very dangerous world, isn't it?
Even this seemingly peaceful town could be attacked by the dragon tribe at <cf>any</cf> moment......
You should <cf>decide where to evacuate to in case of emergency, right?
Well, I have a ship, so if things get bad, I'll leave the land.
From here on, the Buffarian cult has jurisdiction.
Outsiders are not allowed here.
This is the garrison of the Buffarian Order Guards.
We are in charge of guarding the sanctuary and the surrounding area.
If you see anything suspicious, please notify the nearest guard immediately.
I can't give you the details, but <cf> you should stay away from the sacred place.
Because it's a sacred place? <cf> Don't be silly, that's not the reason.
Anyway, it's bad out there. <cf>I have a feeling something ominous will happen in the not-too-distant future. ......
Oops, not good if the captain hears about it. ......<cf>This is the end of the story.
The goblins in this area are quite tough.
They've recruited some of the best guards in the Order.
This is the Temple of Asterlys of the Buffalian cult. <cf> Have you come to pray to God?
The Buffalian God is in heaven, <cf>always protecting us.
<cf>This temple, too, was built on the highest ground, the tallest building, to be as close as possible to where God is!
<cf>There are many words that mislead people's minds these days. <cf>Don't forget to be grateful to God, and don't ever bend your faith.
This is the "Mihashira" of "Kamigakari.
Do not approach it without reason. <cf> If you are a believer, you should have a little more common sense.
<cf>There are a lot of people who come here for sightseeing these days. <cf>They are not just casually letting us in, they know where they are going to find us.
Welcome. This is the "Mihashira," or "Pillar of the Gods. <cf> The most important sanctuary of the Buffalian religion.
It is said that long ago, the founder of the Buffalian faith appeared here and told the people the will of the Buffalian gods.
A fitting figure for such a legend, isn't it? <cf>You can't get that close to see the whole thing!
<cf>Therefore, step away a little. <cf>We don't like it when you get too close.
Welcome. <cf>How can we help you?
<cf>For quests, go to the center counter on your left. <cf>The warehouse is available at the counter on your right.
<cf>The Glory Coins can be exchanged at the exchange counter on the first floor. <cf>For research, please use the bookshelf on the second floor.
There he is, that Koshimo guy, ......!
He's so restless, ....... <cf>What's the matter?
I don't think that thick-skinned loan shark would <cf>care about being seen</cf>.
Come to think of it, Koshimo's partner is missing. <cf>Is there something going on somewhere I don't know about......?
What, Koshimo, the loan shark, has turned himself in to the Temple!
Oh no, why ......? <cf> No matter how hard I chased after him, I couldn't get him off my tail.
Who on earth used what method? <cf>Please, tell me!
As an undercover agent in the Guard, I can't overlook this! <cf> Let me see that man!
<cf>What's going on? <cf> First, let's say hello to the innkeeper.
Well, wait. <cf>We'll wait to go outside until we've seen a little more of the city.
<cf>We're going to get pushed around by Feste, but <cf>well, ...... he's a hard guy to hate!
He tried to save you at the ruins, didn't he?
Between you and me, Feste can <cf>blind</cf> himself at least.
He usually uses it to wind up his enemies just fine. <cf> But there you are, in a ruin I thought was empty.
I don't have to tell you the rest, do I?　That's how it is.
He's twisted on the surface, but basically he's a softy, <cf> that guy.
Oh, you don't look familiar. <cf>Are you offering me a job?　Or is it an order?
If you want to get a job here at the Pioneer Bureau, you'll have to take the test for adventurers.
Let's see, the pioneering bureau in Asterlys is ......
Oh, I'm sorry, the Pioneering Station is <cf>just up the street, right?
I just arrived from Salamzat today, so I don't know much about this town.
What?　Are you new to this town too? <cf> What a pity!
Come on, get on with the test!
<cf>If you're an adventurer, there's nothing better than being an adventurer for a living. <cf>More importantly, you can earn money!
<cf>The Lake Tunnel is located in the "Sea Rhythm Meadow". <cf>The test is to explore this place.
<cf>To reach the deepest part of the tunnel, through an old tunnel inhabited by monsters.
I don't think it's that dangerous, but <cf>don't let up. Good luck!
Hey, rookie! <cf>How are you doing?
I'm the one who scouted it out. <cf>Don't let the registration exam trip you up, okay?
<cf> I don't see anything wrong with my eyes! <cf>Easy work for you!
I look forward to hearing your Success report. <cf>Good Luck!
Hey! <cf>You're going to the Lake Lydd Tunnel, right?
It's a long way in there. <cf>If you think it's like "Cliff Ruins", you'll get hurt.
There might even be an unexpected Accident. <cf> But it is also an adventurer's ability to deal with them.
HAHAHA! Well, don't worry. <cf>Well, don't worry, you can handle most things. <cf> You'll be fine!
<cf>Have you cleared the Lake Tunnel? <cf> You're done with the registration test!
What's wrong?　You look like you're in trouble. <cf>There was no Trouble, was there?
<cf>You can go and report to Muley now! <cf>Congrats to the new adventurer!
Oh, I heard. <cf>I heard you passed the registration exam for the Pioneer Bureau.
That's great! <cf>This will make it easier to search for memories.
You'll be going away more often, and don't forget to raise your <cf>adventurer rank</cf> on the adventure board, okay?
That's Buffalia's legacy, too, as I recall. <cf>The more you accomplish, the better adventurer you are.
Jake's guy looks like he's done a hell of a lot of work, <cf>I hear he's done a hell of a lot.
<cf>There are places you can't go if your rank is low. <cf>There's no harm in doing it, so go for it!
It seems to pay well, and <cf>sometimes it's not a bad idea to venture out for the sake of the board.
Did Jake offer you a job? <cf>He's become a full-fledged adventurer.
He's a first class adventurer. <cf>Every job he takes is of the highest caliber.
If you got offered a job there, that's great. <cf>You must have a lot of potential.
<cf>Go out there and do it right! <cf>I'll be rooting for you in the shadows.
What are you doing? <cf>The souvenir exchange is just around the corner.
What? <cf>...... going to "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon"?
And with Jake!
Gosh... ....... <cf>That's quite an honor, Kimi.
But it's pretty dangerous there<cf>and they say there's been some crazy monsters out there lately.
Anyway, you need to be well prepared<cf>and take all possible precautions.
I heard you've been investigating the "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon".
Hmm?　You don't <cf>think</cf> it's just one and done, do you? That would be a waste.
It's such a big place with a lot of mysteries. <cf>We have to investigate over and over again to find the heritage and treasures.
That's what being an adventurer is all about. <cf>Whenever you feel like it, go back. You'll discover something new.
Beyond this point is the "Soundless City. <cf>The ruins are under the jurisdiction of the Order of Buffalia.
I'm sorry, but no one is allowed to enter for a while. <cf>An unidentified monster has appeared in the depths of the city.
It is now off limits until safety is confirmed. <cf>There seems to be no sign of the monster as of late. ......
Anyway, even adventurers are no exception. <cf>Now, just don't go near it unnecessarily.
Ahead is the "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon". <cf>I heard there was some kind of monster out there.
<cf>It's not a situation that can be easily explored. <cf> Usually we can come and go as we please.
What?　You and Jake are going to team up to take it down?
That would be great!　Good luck with that. <cf>Don't make the mistake of trying to do it alone, okay?
I heard you beat the monster that was in there.　That's great, man!
What?　The monster is the legendary ...... avaritia? <cf>Hey, come on, you've got to be kidding me.
Hmmm, but you saw it too, didn't you Jake? <cf>Something about that story is just unbelievable.
Oh well. Now I'm free to explore again. <cf>You should come back later if you're interested.
<cf>I didn't know that <cf>avaritia lived in the Claws of the Giant Dragon</cf> ......
After all, <cf>Abaritia was the cause of the monster turned into flux: ......
Oh, this is an adventurer!
Thanks to your work, what has been a mystery until now is <cf> gradually being unraveled!
Please keep up the good work!
The old man at the coin pavilion said he'd buy you a drink, ze? <cf>You should go now. Or rather, go. Kukuku......
Yo, good job! <cf>Sounds like you're doing a good job, So good!
Did you run into any dragon people or avaritia? <cf>I've heard a lot about them since then. ......
<cf>After all, there is some movement on the part of the dragon tribe. <cf>Their behavior pattern is different from before.
<cf>When I think back, the attack on the Principality of Barnhart was also strange. <cf>The dragon tribe, I heard they "retreated" to some extent.
<cf>Once you get into a fight, you either do it or you don't. <cf>That's why the dragon tribe were such a dangerous bunch. ......
It's called avaritia, and it smells really nasty. <cf>If you think you're in trouble, you can always call on me.
Dr. Wahlkin said he wanted to <cf>research about "The Ruins of the Giant Tower."
He's the kind of guy who acts on the spur of the moment, so <cf>I didn't ask him for the details.
<cf>The Buffalian priests are the ones who teach us how to use our Buffalian heritage.
So the priests are learning a lot about their heritage.
Well, you have to be a smart person to be a priest.
Many of the scholars who study the ruins and history <cf> also studied in the temples of Buffalia.
You know how much of the Buffalian heritage can be found in the ruins?
It's usually the adventurers who find it first. <cf>Once they find it, they take it to the Buffalians.
<cf>Once it is found to be safe, it will be used in the city and so on.
What if the adventurers take it with them?
Imagine is a strange thing.
The crystallization of human thoughts and engrams. <cf> This cannot be created even by the heritage of Buffalia.
It is possible to awaken something that is sleeping, but <cf> to create it from scratch, it is impossible!
How on earth can it be born out? ...... <cf> Hmmm, I don't know. It is a mystery.
Does it go to the "Mihashira" of "KAMIGAKARI"? <cf> That's an interesting story.
<cf> That's a lot of work just to get in there. <cf> That's part of the challenge of being an adventurer.
Me?　Of course I've been there. <cf>Don't underestimate the top of the top, okay?
...... but only in the lower levels due to a maintenance request from the cult.
<cf>The Mihashira of Kamigakari is a precious "living relic. <cf>There is no mercy for intruders. Be very careful.
Adventurers, is there anything you are missing?
<cf>As you become accustomed to adventuring, you must be careful. <cf>The more seasoned adventurers value preparation.
You can't say you're a newcomer anymore. <cf>You, too, must be well-prepared for your adventures.
The doctor is jumping to conclusions too quickly. <cf>Even people in the past lived each day steadily.
They ate rice, sang songs, ....... <cf>The accumulation of such daily life is history, isn't it?
It's not like they're all cannons, ancient weapons, or other such conspicuous things<cf>that are conveniently left as relics.
The Buffalian cult is hiding something! <cf>There must be some secret that they don't want to be made public!
Otherwise, why don't you let us investigate the "Mihashira" of KAMIGAKARI? <cf> Why don't you let us examine the relics that are in the main temple?
<cf>If my discourse is wrong, you can deny it once and for all! <cf>Yet you harass me with your leftward movement and other such tactics. ......
That is the proof that my theory is in touch with the truth! <cf>I will never change my theory!
The founder of the Buffalian religion was a visitor!　The "Ruins of the Giant Tower" is a cannon! <cf>Yes, it must be so!　<cf>Yes, it must be so!
Tell your master to pay the bill. <cf>They're just piling up, I tell you. ......
Wait a minute! <cf>We can't let anyone in without a permit!
Normally, this place is only for limited ceremonies, such as the ordination of the chief priest.
So why was permission granted to you outsiders? ......
Well,...... you are getting into good shape as adventurers. <cf>I see you've cleared some pretty tough hurdles.
It's a real permit for sure. <cf>It's been a long time since I've seen one.
Normally, adventurers alone are not allowed to enter. <cf>In most cases, they are accompanied by someone from the Buffalian church.
<cf>This is a rare case, but I suppose it is the will of the Buffalian gods.
If you have a permit, there is nothing to say. <cf>Please, come in.
[<cf> It is an act of discretion to pry into the affairs of those who have been granted access to the mihashira.
<cf>So I will ask no questions. <cf>And your lady looks very tired.
She should rest at once. <cf>Now, hurry on to Larpal.
You don't come back very often. ...... <cf>No, I mean my colleagues.
After you guys left, <cf>he said he was really curious to see what was inside.
Something seemed to glow at the top of the [Mihashira]. ...... <cf>Well, that's what God does. There's nothing we can do about it.
This is the sacred place of our God. This is the sacred place of our God. <cf> Accept all events as fate.
......Please be quiet!
<cf>Please be quiet!　How was the "Mikahashira"?
[Did you find any visitors or clues to your memory?
Well, it's no use if you struck out. <cf> You'll find out sooner or later. Take your time.
A colleague of mine who used to work with me on security <cf>was tragically injured. ......
He couldn't stop himself from going up there, <cf>without asking me to stop him.
It's not easy to do, but he was a martyr to his duty. <cf>I will continue to stand here to live up to him.
The last gatekeeper was a serious guy.
Hmm, you know him? <cf> I see. ...... Well, remind him of that from time to time.
<cf>You were told not to go, but you went in. <cf>You didn't have to be that loyal to your job. ......
What, you guys are still here?
[You're not supposed to go in there, are you?
Okay, okay. <cf> If you've done what you had to do, get out of here.
Thanks to you, my body is feeling a little better. <cf> But I can't stay resting forever!
I need to go liberate Avaritia as soon as possible: ......
Hey, can you <cf>tell us a little bit about how chronoleaps work?
Oh, I'm not trying to abuse it, okay? <cf> I'm just genuinely curious, okay?　Mm-hmm!
Yes, a little bit is fine. <cf> Because we trust you. See?
Gghh......!　Don't look at me so innocently. <cf>It's hard to trust someone so innocently.
Hmmm, let's see, ...... is how chronoleaps work, isn't it? <cf>It's obvious that you need a device that was in [Mihashira]'s [Mihashira] ......
In order to transcend space-time, you need a special fuel, a 'chronogram'<cf>.
A chronogram?
Yes, it is. The greater the range of time you jump, the more chronograms <cf> you consume.
But chronograms are very precious. ......
With the amount I was able to prepare, Tirith and I were only able to jump in this time period.
Then, when you jumped with us,......
Oh, that's okay. <cf>It was only for a few hours, so we didn't spend that much.
<cf>I can manage to get back to my own time with Tirith, <cf>accurately.
I see. <cf>By the way, how to make those chronograms and stuff [--].
Hmmm, it's a secret.
I guess it's not so easy after all.
Speaking of which, why is Erlinse <cf>so worn out?
...... That device had a broken <cf> energy supply source.
The only way to activate it in that state is to consume the activator's own energy <cf>...... engrams!
Master Ehrinse must have cut his own engram to the limit in order to save us.
He is the kind of person who would easily do such a thing without thinking about himself!
I didn't know that. ...... Well, you know, what the heck. <cf> Give him a good rest.
Yes, sir. Even if it costs me my life, I'll let him rest.
I've heard rumors about you for a while now. ...... <cf>I hear the "Dragon King" has finally revealed himself.
With him at the top, <cf>it seems the disparate dragon clans have come together as one.
What......? <cf>You met the Dragon King Voldigen!
Hey, man, I'm surprised you're okay. ...... <cf>You're no match for him!
<cf>Don't even think about it, okay? <cf>Survival is one of the most important missions of an adventurer.
But why does the founder look so sad?
Eh? <cf>What are you talking about?
Look up at that statue of our founder.
He looks like a mask.
<cf>I run a store, but it's not going so well.
I come here every day to pray for business.
[<cf>My wife tells me to work when I don't have time to pray.
Is that really true? <cf> Doesn't that mean I should just work?
My girlfriend is very religious.
I'm in the middle of praying, so <cf>just leave her alone.
......God of Buffalia,<cf> grant us ......
May we be ......<cf>...... at peace,......<cf> and may we be ......<cf> ......
May ......<cf>...... light of faraway ......<cf>...... be upon us!
I have lived a healthy life without serious illness until I reached this age.
I believe this is because the God of Buffalia has been watching over me.
Mother, what about the "Ojibashira cookies"?
You said you would buy them for me!
If you lie, God will punish you!
As I told you, the information about the <cf>chronoleaps</cf> is highly classified.
Of course, the same applies to the "chronogram," <cf>so please don't tell anyone about it!
By the way, senior, do you think you can get the <cf>"luminous core"?
As Mr. Feste said earlier, <cf>I think there is a high possibility of finding them at the Buffalia ruins.
Why don't you try going to the place called "<cf>[valley] of the [machine ruins]"<cf>......
What's changed recently? <cf>Oh, ...... come to think of it, I heard a strange sound near the village.
What was that? <cf>It sounded like a creature's voice, or not......
Anyway, it was the most <cf>weirdest sound I've ever heard. ......
Are you an adventurer? <cf>Then why don't you go check it out?
There's a hut by a bridge nearby,<cf> and on the way there, I saw a strange shadow.
The shadow was headed towards "The Hunter's Loophole,"......<cf> but I had a really bad feeling about it. ......
Hey, you! <cf>Be careful if you're going to explore this area!
I heard that there were some pretty tough monsters out there to the southwest. <cf>It's rumored that the average adventurer won't be able to stand up to them!
Traveler. Have you seen the Buffalian pilgrims?
This village is part of the pilgrimage route. <cf>Thank goodness it's a small village with nothing to offer!
I thought I'd at least give you something to energize you. <cf> I thought I would serve you a dish with yams from around here.
I wonder if the oracle priestess will be pleased.
Oh, you guys. <cf>Did they do something to you by any chance?
I've stopped hearing those weird noises I used to hear from the mountains. <cf> It was so creepy. That's a relief.
I still wonder what it was, though. <cf> That creepy sound?　The voice?
Was it something in "The Hunter's Loophole"?
Oh, you don't have to tell me! <cf> Was it some weird monster anyway?
You took them down, didn't you? <cf>Then that's fine. Thanks a lot.
Hey!　How was the tough monster!
What, you took them down?　That's great!
Thanks for having a strong adventurer like you!
Hey, you in the same boat? <cf> Then you better watch out!
<cf>I hear there's a tough monster out there in the Hunter's Passage. <cf> I've never seen a monster like that before, and they say it's very strong.
And I'm the girl who's going to beat it and make a name for herself!
...... but I'm not fully prepared yet. <cf> Careful, careful ......
Ahhh, I found rust on my equipment. <cf>I need to get some new stuff.
And maybe the items aren't quite ready yet. ...... <cf>I'll have to buy more of these too.
The monster that appeared in "The Hunter's Loophole" ....... <cf>It's been defeated.
No, no. It's a good thing it got knocked down. <cf> Yeah.
The problem is that I took on the task of defeating the monster. <cf> If I had been prepared, it would have been over.
Let's just say Atashi defeated it. ...... <cf>No, but that's ....... I don't have any proof. ......
I was told by adults not to go outside the city. <cf>Because I could hear the monster's voice.
If you don't hear those voices anymore......, then <cf>the monsters have been exterminated, right?
Well, good, good, good. <cf>I'd just about exhausted all the fun I could have had in the house.
The monster in "The Hunter's Loophole" was defeated. <cf>I don't know who or where did it, but thank goodness!
It doesn't look like the adventurers we hired in the village did it. <cf>So, did a passing adventurer do it?
The fact that you don't give your name means ....... <cf>Are you some kind of saint who needs neither fame nor reward?
Or was there a circumstance? <cf>I really wanted to thank you for your help: ......
<cf>There's a valley on the northeastern edge of the Asteria Plains called <cf>The Clawmarks of the Giant Dragon</cf>.
According to mythology, this is where the dragon tribe and the Buffalian gods <cf>fought</cf>.
Recently, there have been reports of sightings of mysterious monsters. <cf>What in the world is going on here......
Jake is awesome. <cf>He's like that, but when he does it, he does it!
Huh? <cf>For example, ......?
Well, I can't remember right off the top of my head. ......<cf> Well, he's awesome anyway!
It's another beautiful day!
The skyline looks even more beautiful!
Maybe I should use the portal.
Or maybe I should walk.
I haven't been getting enough exercise lately, so I'm torn!
Hah ...... taht ......! <cf>kk...... gwah...... hah, hah!
Hm?　...... don't talk to me for a second. Ha, ha, <cf>I'm in the middle of image training for a battle with a dragon, ha!
What's with that face? I know you're anxious, but don't worry. <cf>We adventurers will definitely protect this town!
<cf>Whenever I get to the stage where I'm about to leave the city, <cf>I always realize I've forgotten something.
I left my recovery medicine behind. ......<cf>I wonder if it's safe. ......
There aren't that many strong monsters around the city, <cf>I'll be fine, right?　Yes, I'll be fine.
It's been a long time since I've been to the "Lake Tunnel,"<cf>but it's all gone.
In the old days, there was a lot of good ore there.
Weapons made from it were much appreciated by adventurers. <cf>Thanks to them, I made a fortune.
<cf>The dragon tribe that has recently been sighted is a lowly "demi-dragon".
But don't underestimate them. <Even a bunch of adventurers can't stand up to them.
<cf>I fought one once upon a time. <cf>See my old wounds?
I'm just joking, here in the streets. <cf> Ha-ha-ha-ha!
This shaft connects ...... like this ......<cf> Wow!　I didn't know it was going to be like this!
This is going to transmit<cf>power to the wheels much more efficiently than I thought!
Hehehe, I want to build a car when I grow up!
Sorry, we're sold out today! <cf>There was a huge line of people waiting to get in!
What?　What were they selling?
Come back tomorrow and you'll see!
We've been selling houseplants for 40 years, 40 years, you know?
But we don't sell much these days. <cf>Maybe they're losing heart?
<cf>That's why I think so. <cf>Surrounded by greenery like this......
<cf>Take a deep breath of fresh air. <cf>See, don't you feel at ease?
How about some spices from around the world?
Hakusetsu sansho and kumari powder. <cf>There is also the much talked-about red hot pepper!
Add a dash of spice to your supper stew and <cf>you'll have a happy family gathering and a happy evening!
Welcome! How about some flowers? <cf>Hana are~......Ohana......
......I told my father I wanted to be a florist.
But there's something a little different about this store. ......
Dad's away stocking up, so <cf>I'm looking after the store for him.
I'm going to be a businessman like my dad someday!
He's awesome!　Dad! <cf> I'm going on a big boat to Barnhart to buy some stuff.
I'll be home a little late this time....
Hey!　You want one?
What?　You see that? <cf> It's a circle, a circle.
Don't tell me you don't know what it is! <cf> Damn, ......, the shabba's changed.
<cf>They're inexpensive, inexpensive, inexpensive tableware!
We've got a large shipment and they're on sale at a great price!
...... Damn, why aren't they selling? <cf>The store is too modest?　I don't like it!
This is "Remi Loire". <cf>This is a beauty salon for you who want to be beautiful!
What do we do inside? <cf>...... interested?
But I'm sorry. This is an introduction-only salon. <cf>We can't let you in, a total stranger.
Hey!　You damn vending machine! <cf>It's broken again!
I want my 100 Lunos back!
What am I doing? <cf> I'm meeting up with a friend.
We're supposed to go shopping together.
Rumor has it that there's a monster out there lately that you've never seen before, right? <cf> So I've decided...
I'm going to be an adventurer!
Someday, I want to wield a cool sword like this and fight for <cf>you</cf>!
200,000 Lunos a month or ....... <cf>The location is unquestionable. ......
Oh, what do you think? <cf>I'm planning to open a skewer shop here.
Smoke?　Well, that's going to happen. <cf> Hmmm, will it work? ......
Today, I got some live silver sand fish from the fish market, so <cf>we'll have white divon.
Hmmm......? <cf>Red Dibon is cheaper by 300 Lunos!
This is the biggest problem I've had today.
Aaaaaaahhhh, nice breeze!
You should try it.
You want to go shopping?
If so, the mall is the place to be. <cf> You don't have to go all over the place.
Location? <cf> Up this hill and to the right.
Weapons equipment, recovery medicine, <cf> good deals all year round[--].
<cf> "Yellow Roof Market", a shopping mall with yellow roofs!
Just up these stairs[--].
The yellow-roofed shopping mall, <cf>"Yellow Roof Market," is a must-see!
Phew...... can finally take a breather. ......
I just came up from [Gaimon Plaza], <cf> the hill, you know, it's hard. ......
<cf>I can't go on for too long, even if it's gradual. <cf>You can't win against age!
What?　[<cf> Is it the street gate plaza? <cf>Where is it? It's just down this central street.
<cf>As you can see, we're a dibon shop. <cf>We have a wide variety of products, from the standard to the finest.
We even have some rare stuff you don't see very often.
Sourced?　Hey, you doubt it? <cf>All of our products are genuine and from reputable sources.
Cheap, cheap, cheap! <cf>Fresh fish, just caught this morning!
...... ain't selling well. <cf>I guess I got carried away and stocked up too much.
I guess I'll just have to pickle them in salt.
I don't like it when I get old and forget things.
...... Did you give him the change? <cf>I forgot.
How do you like it? <cf>Fresh vegetables from the Minsterhorn!
<cf>They're full of nutrients! <cf> Aren't they beautifully colored?　Delicious!
<cf>Meat and fish are good too. <cf>You have to eat vegetables for your health!
Don't be picky eaters. <cf>Well, I bought some!
This cat, he's always here.
I wonder if he is kept at a neighbor's house. <cf>I love it!
My brother is too weak to have a pet.
Hey, hey, kitty. <cf> Can I come visit you sometime?
This is Craftsman's Square. <cf>We call it 'Craftsman's Square.
And what you see there is the "rolling ball kneading ceremony". <cf>That big guy will do the crafting for you guys.
You say it looks difficult? <cf> Don't be silly, it's deceptively simple.
Just throw in a few ingredients, pay a few runos, and <cf>you'll be done while you're yawning!
<cf> You've got to get used to it. <cf>Go by the kneading ritual and give it a try!
......, man, what a convenient time we live in!
...... I see. <cf>The combination of this material and that material
It was dangerous not to mix them. ......
This staircase is a shortcut to the [Gaimon Plaza].
I don't go up them.
Down these steps is the harbor.
My father works at the harbor.
Today, a very important cargo arrives.
Did you know?　This tree is a gift from the Duchy of Barnhart as a token of friendship!
Isn't it wonderful? <cf> Strong branches, roots spreading wide and deep ......
<cf>Sounds like the embodiment of some country that is the leader of this planet!
Long live the Duchy of Barnhart! <cf> Long live my homeland!
Our people asked me to look after the store, but <cf>there's nothing to be stolen!
This is a school for children.
The school is run by the Buffalians, and <cf>anyone is free to attend!
The teachers are also priests. <cf>They teach us all sorts of things.
Not only the doctrine and history of the Order, <cf>but also the use of foreign languages and the Buffalian heritage.
I'm sure <cf>these schools are a big part of the reason why the Buffalian religion is so popular among the people.
I provide security for this pavilion. <cf>What of it?
You ...... if you <cf>have not heard of the Ganador family?
A family that has been instrumental in the prosperity of the city for generations, since the time Asterlys was built?
Let's be clear. <cf>This house is different from those common people.
If you understand that, then don't hang around here. <cf>If you try anything funny, I'll pull you over!
This is the "Mou Tree Square.
That's what the tree in the middle of the square is called!
The name "Mou Tree" is derived from the legendary priest of Barnhart Parish, <cf>Mouwel-sama</cf>. ......
It is also said that it is because of the "moo~~" sound it makes when the wind blows through the gaps in its trunk.
I wonder why such extremes of lore <cf>remain?
I'm closing up store for the day. <cf>It doesn't matter what time it is or what time it is.
I decide when I feel like it!
Sorry, young man. <cf> This is my reserved seat.
I like to drink quietly in the corner. <cf> Well, it's not bad to be lively, either.
<cf>A long time ago, this place was a rundown, deserted, crumbling bar. <cf>Wascha, I've been sitting here since then.
Now it's a great place. <cf>It is thanks to the efforts of the owner that men and women, young and old, can enjoy themselves here side by side!
Mmmm, it was delicious! <cf>The meat was so tender!
I don't know many restaurants like this, so <cf>I'm glad you told me about this good one!
Hey, let's try something sweet next time. <cf>Want to walk a bit?
I don't know. <cf>I'm sure this place tastes great!
So...so...what are we going to do after this? What are we going to do after this?
I'd still like to go somewhere, if possible. <cf> Well, you know, if that's okay with you. ......
Silver sandfish are in season right now.
And sunset octopus. <cf>Mushako mussels and sea honey kinkabukuro.
Gae is good dried, and for daisy sashimi, <cf>makanagi is a bit pricey, so ......
I'm not sure if I'd like to try the giant goliath, tono sappa, or sasibashiri,<cf> or even better, nibe nibe and inaina: ......
I'm a little curious about that. ......<cf> What?　What?
It's that girl over there. <cf>See, she's in the white seat on the balcony by the sea......
She's been glancing at me for a while now. <cf>...... I wonder if she has a thing for me.
I'm a little curious about you. ......<cf>What?　What?
That guy over there. <cf>See, he's drinking alone at the standing table......
He's been glancing at me for a while now. <cf>...... what if he's a stalker?
Hey, come here!
It's cheap!　It's delicious! <cf>And one more thing, it's fresh!
<cf>Asterleys is proud to offer fish from all over the world's oceans!
Come by and have a look! <cf>And buy one extra!
Ahhhh!　......It doesn't fit, it doesn't fit......<cf>it doesn't fit no matter how many times I count it!
......No, I received <cf>a shipment from my business partner from Barnhardt!
No matter how many times I count them, the inventory and the numbers don't match up.
I look at the ship from here every day.
I hear there's an island far away where mermaids live!
Who are you?　Who are you? <cf> And you've left it all alone!
And what are these paintings? <cf> I have no idea!
Oh, you, huh? <cf> You want me to clean it up for you?
Don't be nosy. <cf>I'll let you take care of these things on your own.
I'll put up a sign or something.
Welcome!
Wow!　Don't let the fish get so close!
They smell fishy and slimy. <cf> I just can't stand it!
I can't just skip it because I'm helping out at home. ...... <cf>Oh, how depressing!
Here you go! <cf>How about a fresh fish dish?
Fried, grilled, stewed, salads, <cf>soups, pastas, you name it!
<cf>Asterly's specialty, specially selected seafood! <cf>We'll cook it right here on the spot!
Ah, customers!　You have a nice ogori! <cf>Would you like me to clean it for you?
<cf>I run a small bistro and come here all the time to stock up!
Not only are the fish fresh, <cf>but you can sometimes find some rare fish!
Oops. There's a six-star starfish in the mix. <cf> They can't be eaten, but they are a sign of good luck!
Maybe I'll have a good day.
<cf>There's something wrong with the crane. <cf>I asked them to fix it, but they never came.
I thought I could do something about it, so I started banging on it and it just wouldn't come.
<cf> I thought I could do something about it myself, but it just wouldn't come. <cf>A specialist is the only way to do it.
I may look like this, but I used to be a sailor.
I've been to the Duchy of Barnhart many times. <cf>Not only that. I've been to the outer continent.
A big liner is one thing, but taking on the seas on our own is not so bad.
<cf>There are many lands in the world that have yet to be discovered. <cf>I'd be happy if the young mons could find them.
<cf>Well, what the heck. <cf>These days there's nothing but cancellations.
<cf>Well, maybe it can't be helped, since the dragon tribe is going out all over the place.
<cf>Thanks to them, we can't do any business here. <cf>The inns that cater to sailors are deserted.
Oh, no, no, no. <cf> I wish someone would get rid of the dragon tribe.
What are you doing?　Don't you see? <cf> I'm working on the car.
That's what I do. <cf>I have to feed my little brother.
He likes cars too, and he seems to know a lot about them, but <cf>it's a lot of hard work!
If you want to craft, <cf>you can ask him down these stairs.
I saw it.
<cf>Green Nappo came out of the flower beds over there.
Not just one. Lots of them. <cf>Marching from one to the other, they went away.
But they don't believe me.
Would you like a vase? <cf>It's by a very famous potter.
Let me tell you something. <cf>...... the potter isn't even human!
Actually,<cf>...... there is a dragon tribe disguised as humans,<cf> secretly making pots,<cf>......
.........!　That would be interesting. <cf>So, what do you think?　Wouldn't you like to buy one?
I sell some of the world's rarest spices.
I've walked all over the world myself, and I'm a connoisseur.
Well, there was a rumor of a summit meeting in Salamseert, where I was buying.
I hear that the Commander of the Knights of Barnhart will be there, but he's probably too busy fighting dragon tribes.
Come on, come on, it's cheap! <cf>Every kind of fruit in the world is available!
......Everything is an oversimplification. <cf>There is a certain amount of everything!
......Some is also too much. <cf>A little bit of everything!　...... probably have a little bit of everything!
I should have looked for a bigger store. ......
The brightest star in the night sky is Athenion.
It's the incarnation of the Buffalian god who saved the earth. <cf> Honorable name was given to the star!
You should listen to an old tale once in a while.
You never know what you might hear.
This hill is called "Pineapple Street.
In the old days, during the pineapple boom, there used to be as many as <cf>30 stores specializing in pineapple!
Not only food and drinks, but also detergents, medicines, cosmetics, <cf>everything was filled with pineapple!
<cf>At one point, the pineapple was even tending the store by itself. <cf>Sounds like he was so good that rumors like that started to circulate.
It's hard to know which weapon is right for you, isn't it?
But when you do, it's best to try out different weapons.
Get used to it instead of worrying about it! <cf>Try it out and you may discover something new!
Well, I don't have any money, so I'm just looking: ......
Green Nappo-kun is my friend.
Purple Nappo-kun is a little scary though.
Don't tease him too much, Mr. Nappo!
Up the hill is the Pioneer Station.
Down the stairs is the Craftsmen's Square.
Welcome! <cf> Here you'll find all kinds of unusual things!
I got them all the way from Salamzart! <cf>Will you buy something for me?
<cf>Salamuzat is a long way. <cf>It's through plateaus, canyons, and beyond the desert.
You should be prepared for a pretty long trip.
Sorry. This is a warehouse. <cf>My husband collects all this junk.
Literally, there's enough to sell. <cf> Ah ha ha!
<cf>My husband has a store on Donkey Row. <cf>My boy keeps the store, so you'll know him.
Yeah, I'm a blacksmith. <cf>But I don't deal in any kind of weapons.
I don't even accept re-hammers. Sorry about that.
I swore I'd never get involved in a fight again. ......
I'll never get back into the fight that took him and his daughter from me. ......
I hear vending machine vandalism is all the rage these days.
That's why I'm keeping an eye on them.
Hmmm...!　My eyes are blurry......<cf>I'm getting old. Oh dear!
......You didn't do anything to the vending machine, did you?
Now, which one shall I choose? ...... <cf> mmmmmmmmmmmmmm ......
Hmm?　What is ...... with that old man? <cf>Why is he looking at me all the time?
I can't help it, it's so hard to buy.
It would be embarrassing if he knew I'm a <cf>hidden fan of "Aster Tropical☆Mellow Shrimp Miso Flavor"<cf>. ......
I'm putting up a poster. <cf>I made the poster.
<cf>Advertising the store, announcing live concerts. <cf>I'll take care of anything from flyers to billboards.
<cf>Please come directly to my atelier in Asterleaze harbor if you need anything!
Well, when I say studio, <cf>I'm just borrowing the landing of the stairs of the wharf.
This hill is called "Donkey Street".
<cf>It is said to be named after the donkeys that came and went <cf>many times, loaded with goods to be unloaded at the stores.
You don't see them much anymore, though.
<cf>The gentle but strong donkey is an important friend of humans.
<cf>I've done too much shopping. <cf>I thought I was just passing through. ......
<cf>This hill is a way out from the "Street Gate Plaza," but <cf>there are so many stores, I just end up wandering around.
If you're in a hurry, just keep walking!
Blue sea...... white waves that come and go......
Bright beaches...... shining parasols......
The light of youth...... my lost feelings......
Ahn cheater oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! <cf> Get stuffed in a tar and swept away somewhere ooooh!
Oh, there's oil for the balloon!
My hometown of Salamzat is famous for <cf>floating balloons galore!
They are used for city lights, landmarks in the desert, and <cf>there is a custom to write your wishes on them!
When the wish comes true, they release the balloon into the sky. <cf>This brings back memories. I haven't made one in a while.
Wow, what a beautiful view! <cf>I've always wanted a balcony with a view of the ocean!
I'm so glad we chose this house!
<cf>Asterleaze is getting more and more people, and we're going to run out of houses!
<cf>The good ones are selling fast! <cf>If you like it, there's no time to hesitate!
I bought this house because you said it had a great view!
Where is it? <cf>You can hardly see the ocean!
When I complained, they just brushed it off as ["]I don't care where the other houses are located["]<cf>. ......
Damn, damn, damn!　I was cheated!
This is the main entrance to the Asteria Opera House.
Unfortunately, there won't be any events for a while. <cf> Usually, the "Star Festival" is held here.
<cf>This year, there has been no announcement yet! <cf>I'm looking forward to it too!
I can't wait to see the divas on stage!
Up this hill, you'll find the temple.
It's the biggest temple in the world! <cf> Of all the ones I've seen!
Don't be surprised! <cf>["]They say you can't hear a song when it's stopped!
[<cf><cf>It's important to keep a normal mind and finish the job. I was taught this at school the other day!
That's the Asteria Plain you see across the ocean.
That broken tower is the ruins of Buffalia.
Broken...... I know, right? <cf> It's supposed to be broken, but there are pieces of it floating in the air.
Adventurers go to ruins like that to solve mysteries, right? <cf> That's amazing, isn't it?
Well, well, it's a magnificent garden.
It is indeed a great temple of the Buffalian religion. <cf>I bet they have a lot of money to spare.
<cf>No, no, it's fine. <cf>I am an impious man of little faith.
<cf>As long as the house is lit and there is running water,<cf> I don't want anything more than that.
Damn. ....... <cf>The guards' eyes are shining here too!
Whoa!　What is it? <cf>I'm just an old man passing through!
<cf>I would never think of sneaking into the temple from such a place!
Oh, no, no, no, no!　Just go away!
This is the Temple of Buffalia. <cf>Welcome, you have come!
<cf>Pray to the Lord, and He will bless you. <cf>The temple is open to all.
Of course, there are unbelievers, but <cf>we, the Order's Guard, will not let them pass.
As long as we keep an eye on them, they will not be able to approach the Temple. <cf> Rest assured, we will not let them pass. Hahaha!
From here on out, this is a sacred place. <cf>No frolics and no fuss.
And of course, no business.
<cf>I would never allow anyone other than the cult to use such a delicious place where people come even if you keep quiet. ......
Gohon, gohon! <cf>Anyway, what's no good is no good!
Hey, why don't we open a stall here?
I don't think there's any competition here, <cf>I think it would be a good idea!
Oh, there's something about the guards looking at me. ...... <cf> He's looking at me like I'm rather no good.
What, stinky~. <cf>The good places in the city are already filled.
What?　Don't be early?
Don't get me wrong. <cf>I love the sunrise from here!
But your kindness has touched me.
Let me tell you something good in return.
Try going to the remote backcountry once in a while. <cf> I bet your map will expand!
You're not allowed to go underground.
Well, if you go down there, <cf> the door is locked.
The back of the temple houses precious treasures and <cf>Baphalian heritage.
Unless you have a good reason, you are not allowed to enter. <cf> Go home in peace.
I came here to see the "Priestess of the Oracle."
You are the highest-ranking person in the Buffalian religion.
She is a special priestess who receives the word of the god of Buffalia as an oracle and delivers it to us.
But there is no way that such a noble person would <cf> be in a place like this, is there? Oh, well...
Only one "oracle priestess" is chosen from generation to generation.
The oracle is given by the gods[--] and that duty can only be fulfilled by someone with <cf>special powers.
Who is chosen and how? <cf> Only God knows that.
The chosen priestess will offer herself for God, for the Order, <cf>and for the people.
This light must not be extinguished.
This is the light that was separated from the light of hope that the God of Buffalia once gave to the desolate earth.
As long as this light remains lit, <cf> we can continue to receive God's grace!
When this light is extinguished, hope is also crushed. <cf>Are you ready?　This light must not be extinguished!
It's a big temple, isn't it?　Do you know that this temple is <cf> the ruins of Buffalia?
This place is huge, but <cf>"Mihashira" in the ruins is also huge!
It is one of the largest ruins on the Baha Mar Plateau and is said to be a masterpiece in terms of beauty.
I've never seen it.
...... They say the holy city of Buffalia has been hit.
The world wants to make it a wrinkle for the dragon people, but ....... <cf>Yes, they do. We know it.
There's no doubt about it. They're on the move. ......
We are the only ones who know the truth. ...... <cf>You know what you have to do ......?
...... silly, it's too early!
You can't mess with the holy land of Buffalia. ...... <cf>What are 'they' thinking?
We are the only ones who realize the world is in danger. ...... <cf>What a lonely battle......!
<cf>Is there no one somewhere who can share this weight with us? ......
The God of Buffalia is in heaven.
He has given the earth to us mortals, <cf>and has moved himself beyond the sky!
Do you see the "heavenly crests" that adorn the sky? <cf> That is the sign left by the God of Buffalia.
May we all look up to the sky from time to time, and let our gratitude to God be engraved in our hearts.
Sorry about that. We are still preparing.
We are going to deal with the heritage of Buffalia. <cf>But the finished products are too expensive for me to afford.
I'm thinking of <cf> selling and buying broken parts and junk parts.
I may request something from the adventurers as well. <cf>Thank you in advance then.
Hey, you know what?
It's the "oracle priestess" of the Buffalian religion. <cf> She's going on a pilgrimage at a time like this.
<cf>They say that the number of monsters has been increasing recently, and <cf>the dragon tribe has invaded the Principality of Barnhart, hasn't it?
I wonder if it's going to be all right. <cf>I hope it doesn't happen too often.
Welcome! <cf>How do you like it?　Isn't our selection amazing?
<cf>It's hard to collect this much fruit now. <cf>Monsters are suddenly increasing and attacking the fields and such.
Sometimes they destroy our wagons. <cf>And now we're seeing bandits and thieves too!
I wonder what the Buffalians are doing about it. <cf>[They're] protecting the people ["]"] or something like that.
One, two, three...... Okay, the numbers are right on.
It's my job to keep track of the stock. <cf>If even one number is off, it's a lot of work.
<cf>I mean, that's what every job is about, isn't it? <cf>You should get in the habit of checking every detail.
<cf>If you're missing one thing or one material that you need to deliver, <cf>it just adds to the hassle.
Mhm~! <cf>It's good. I feel really good!
The food tastes good!　The breeze is pleasant! <cf>Dibon is going to go on and on and on and on!
<cf>Mmmmmmmmmmmm! <cf> Bring me another bowl of tar!　<cf>That's right~!
What did you say about the transfer portal? <cf>Hmph!　I don't like that thing.
<cf>We used to walk on our own two feet. <cf>That's why vegetables and fruits tasted so good!
<cf>And the food gets damaged when you do space transfers? <cf> I know that!　Don't mock old people!
According to ...... information, this should be the site of the transaction.
Don't worry. They couldn't have known we were here.
Koshimo, the loan shark. <cf> I'll grab that source of funds, sir.
There's a "Canaroan" today?
I'm so glad. I'll have a double.
Hmmm, the aroma is very strong. I can feel the northern air.
Could you please be quiet? <cf> I came here to listen to this fine performance.
Sometimes it's good to stop and listen to the music.
Welcome! <cf>Welcome to the "Kaiten Kaiten"!
Would you like to dine?　Or would you like something to drink? <cf>Please take your time and fill your stomach!
How do you like the music? <cf> My friend's band is playing.
I hope you like it.
The arena is a lot of fun.
A lot of adventurers are taking on challenges. <cf>It's exciting to watch!
The fish here is actually more affordable than at the market.
<cf>There's no better place to shop than by the arena. <cf>I'm such a good shopper!
Ah, it's a nice breeze.
The view is nice and it's quiet. <cf>A surprisingly refreshing place, isn't it?
And most of all, it's nice to be able to look up at the temples.
Well, God of Buffalia. <cf> I'm going to do my best to take care of my husband and son today, let's see.
Mmmm! <cf> A commemorative collection to commemorate the arena spectacle, you say!
A limited edition platter handmade by the Champion. <cf>I don't know why I let the champion make it.
<cf> I don't know why he had it made, but it makes my collector's soul tingle! <cf>What do you say, me!
I'm here to take the top spot in this arena!
Some have made a name for themselves here, becoming Buffalian Guardsmen or joining the <cf>Barnhardt Order</cf>.
I can't let my parents worry about me forever. <cf>I'll make it to the top, I promise!
............
Don't talk to me. I'm trying to stay focused.
The next fight is going to be a tough one.
O God of Buffalia. I am Athenion, incarnate of battle. <cf>Give me strength!
<span size="Big">Yes I have done it! </>
If I didn't miss there......<cf>I must have missed there!
Everyone says ["]don't worry about it["], but<cf>I can't face them......
...... No, don't be depressed. <cf>I'm going to have to brush up on my skills and try again!　This time!
This is the arena of Asterlys.
This whole building is a legacy of Buffalia. <cf>That's why it's such a popular tourist spot!
My friend wanted to see it too<cf>so I decided to show him around: ......
You're late. Did you get lost somewhere?
Welcome to the "Asterlys arena".
Are you a spectator?　Or are you a contestant?
Adventurers come here to test their skills. <cf> You, too, can show off your skills to the fullest.
Wow, it smells so good!
The smell of a bakery is unique, isn't it? <cf>I like that about them.
And of course it's delicious, okay? <cf>But a good smell makes me happy.
<cf>I'm getting hungry when I smell it. <cf>Which one shall I have?
The leaves are growing nicely.
I came to look at flowers for the house. <cf>But it might not be a bad idea to decorate with plants.
I heard that there is such a culture in faraway foreign countries. <cf>Bon something, Wabi something, etc.......
I don't know how difficult it is, but <cf>I might give it a try!
Nice shoes. <cf>Asterlys is indeed the cutting edge of fashion!
<cf>If you call yourself an adventurer in this town, <cf>you should take care of your appearance as well.
I'm going to change the coloring of my outfit, too. <cf>Let's see, the dyes I have on hand are ......
......Uh!　Not enough at all....... <cf>I'll have to finish the request first.
So this is the furnishings we received from Barnhardt.
The name of a trading city is not a given. <cf>This city gathers goods from all over the world.
Many requests for adventurers are escorted by merchants. <cf>I see. If this is how it is, I understand.
Welcome. <cf>Welcome to the "Yellow Roof Market.
Let us do all the shopping for you. <cf>We have a variety of stores here.
Please speak to a shopkeeper and we will be happy to show you around. <cf>Please enjoy yourself!
Newcomer adventurer to the store, ....... <cf>I see. I guess you are preparing to go out of town, right?
The Asteria Plain is a big place. <cf> Especially medicine to heal wounds is a necessity.
<cf>Don't push yourself too far. <cf>You may run into some tough monsters.
Oh, sorry. <cf>This isn't for sale.
It's more of a thing to get rid of. <cf>To put it bluntly, trash.
In a city this big, there's a lot of garbage. <cf>We need a job to collect it and throw it away.
Some of the stuff is still usable, though, and it's a waste. <cf>We should take good care of our stuff.
Wow!　It really is a beach!
Yo, all right. <cf>And then tomorrow, I'll invite my senpai to go swimming: ......
<cf>I've prepared a rather easy swimsuit. <cf>I'm embarrassed, but I'll do my best!
I'll be there. ...... <cf>Otona are carefree and carefree!
<cf>Monsters come out of the sea too, you know. <cf>There are times when liner boats are attacked.
<cf>Why would you go all the way out to the ocean to swim and imitate bait? <cf>I don't think an intelligent person like me would understand.
<cf>The beach is protected by security guards to make sure everyone can swim in peace.
There are no monsters out there.
Don't worry about what the neighbor kids say. <cf>My brother, he just can't swim.
Asterlys is on the southern tip of the Magna continent.
That's why the sun is so strong. <cf>I'd appreciate a place with a roof over my head.
I hear there are <cf> harsher climates on the outer continent, but I can't imagine what it's like!
ff...... ff......<cf>How did you even know I was there?
Hmph...... Hmph......<cf>I'll tell you something nice as a reward!
HUFF...... HUFF......<cf>Don't be careless with the mushrooms you don't understand!
Hmph......<cf>I haven't stopped laughing since a while ago.
I'm on guard duty, keeping an eye on the beach.
I don't want anyone doing anything dangerous or polluting the beach or the ocean<cf>.
This beautiful ocean is the pride of Asterlys. <cf>We all need to protect it.
<cf>Asterleaze became independent <cf>about 400 years ago.
At that time, it was unsettled, with only a few houses and farms.
Now it's the largest trading city on the continent. <cf>That's kind of a crazy story.
Hey, what's going on? <cf> Don't just stand there, come over here.
I have an empty seat next to me.
Let's forget about the time and talk to each other today!
<cf>The casual memories we share here may become an "Imagine" and remain for posterity. Isn't that romantic?
<span size="Big">A~~E～～～～♪</>
What~?　<cf>I'm just practicing my singing~?
<span size="Big">Swa～～～～♪</>
It's a folk song from my childhood island.
<span size="Big">Rae～～～～～</>
Meaning?　I don't know~ It's a subhuman language~ <cf>I don't think it's goblins or mooks~
Nah, it's gone!　My yacht is gone!
Oh, no!　I had it hooked up properly!
Did it get washed away?　Or did it get stolen?
You yacht thief! <cf> I'll ask an adventurer to catch you!
Have you gotten the hang of fishing yet?
Do you keep the rod in line with the direction of the fish, and keep it loose?
It's important to draw the fish in so that the line doesn't break!
If you are tired of adventures, how about a leisurely fishing trip here?
You can even sell the fish you catch and <cf>earn a little extra money</cf>!
Dead end.
Sounds like my life. ......
I came all the way from rural Kanaroa to get rich <cf> doing business.
But now it's ....... <cf>Sorry. Leave me alone.
If you go down these stairs, you'll come to a sandy beach.
Up there is the pioneer station. <cf>Don't ask about other roads!
It can't be helped! <cf>This town is so complicated that even locals get lost!
I should have looked at a map! <cf> Do you know which way is Donkey Street?
What?　What am I doing?
You'll know it when you see it! <cf>I messed up again!
Oh no, my master is going to give me a hard time!
I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere...
That's the one. ......
What was I looking for?
Ha-ha-ha-ha! <cf> Oh no, that's funny!
Let me tell you something.
The best adventurers are obsessed with Enhanced Imagine.
It's not flashy, but it's a surefire way to get stronger.
Do your own research and master it!
I'm negotiating with this guy right now.
I'm having a hard time finding the right guy.
You think he's just going to take advantage of you just because you're a woman?
Do you know what you're getting paid? <cf>...... That's not possible nowadays!
Welcome!
<span size="Big">! </>!
Oh, sir,<cf>...... Excuse me, but you know <cf>Mr. Feste, don't you?
If you need anything, <cf>please contact the manager directly!
Wow, I can't help you with ......, but <cf>I can't help you~~~!
Once upon a time, this world was ruled by a god.
That was the era known as the Buffalian civilization. <cf>There are still ruins left in many places today!
God then moved to heaven. <cf>And he gave the earth to mankind.
We must be grateful to the God of Buffalia, <cf> and make this earth richer and more prosperous!
Asterlys has grown too.
And then the politics are complicated. <cf>There are so many different people's opinions.
The Congress, the Buffalian Church, and the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>The three organizations talk to each other and make policy.
Well, ...... on the surface everyone is cooperative. Yup.
There's a lot of interests, popularity, physical appearance, and so on. <cf>The Pioneering Bureau does well in that regard.
They're all about "pursuing the equitable interests of all mankind. <cf> They're relying on me to be the go-between.
The Nappo are friendly, <cf>non-violent, mysterious monsters.
The green one was the original kind, <cf>and it got along well with humans.
But then, <cf>purple-colored dangerous ones started to appear.
They would harm people. <cf>The green nappos are getting annoyed too.
You see Yee all over town, don't you?
They're like mascots. <cf>They're pretty amazing creatures.
<cf>They regulate the flow of engrams throughout the city so that the legacy of Buffalia runs smoothly.
<cf>Well, it's a comforting thing to see. <cf> People are not always what they seem!
Ahhh, Yee is so cute!
I wish I had one of those ....... <cf>But we can't take it home because it's public property of the city!
...... haha!　I see! <cf>If Ee-chan follows me around, it's legal......!
I'm going to go <cf>purchase some toys to attract Yi's attention!
Do you know the Principality of Barnhart?
It's a military power in the north. <cf>It's a reliable country that protects mankind from the dragon tribe.
It also has long-standing ties with the Buffalian religion, and is <cf>also known as the "Shield of Buffalia.
As long as the Knights of that country are alive and well, <cf>society will continue to develop forever.
There is a <cf>long history</cf> between the Duchy of Barnhart and the Buffalian religion!
It is said that the founding of the country itself was based on a special permission from the Buffalian Gods!
A nation of knights to protect the Buffalian Gods! <cf> Duh, that's so cool!
<cf>The Buffalian cult is believed in all over the world, you know. <cf>The authority of the Order is a very big thing.
Even the presence of that Duchy of Barnhart is because <cf>the Order of Buffalia is behind it!
Since its foundation, the Duchy has had a great mission to protect the Buffalian Faith.
It is, so to speak, a country recognized by the Buffalian gods. <cf>No wonder it is the largest nation on the Magna continent.
<cf>The guard of the Order of Buffalia and the knight of the Duchy of Barnhardt. <cf>Who do you think is stronger?
They have friendly matches every now and then. <cf> Neither of them is inferior to the other, they're both great.
What would happen if they really clashed ....... <cf>I'm honestly curious.
But there is no way<cf>that the Order and the Duchy would ever fight.
They are the strongest because they support each other. <cf>If they were to clash, there would be a hell of a commotion!
Did you hear that?　Rumor has it that the dragon tribe attacked the holy place of the Buffalians!
What a puny thing to do. <cf>The Duchy of Barnhart will not remain silent.
There are ranks among the priests of the Buffalian faith.
There is a chief priest, the most senior, and a first class priest who assists him. <cf>The core of the Order is carried by a chosen few.
Below them are the second and third priests. <cf>I, too, am a young man who has only just become a priest of the third rank.
Rank is not everything, but <cf>I would like to have an appropriate position as a sign of faith.
<cf>Wouldn't you like to take a break once in a while? <cf>I recommend fishing.
It's a great way to relax and play by yourself, <cf>or to pass the time while you're waiting for a meeting.
You can brag to each other about the fish you caught, <cf>or just start a conversation!
This is the "Asterlys Bridge".
As the name suggests, it is a bridge that spans the <cf>trading city of Asterleaze</cf>.
After passing through this cave, you will reach the Bachmar Plateau.
This is Minsterhorn. <cf>An agricultural village.
You would be surprised how quiet it is, unlike Asterlees. <cf>I like the tranquility.
I moved here from Asterlees, <cf>and I like it very much.
...... Well, farming is a lot of work. <cf>especially when monsters ravage it....... Ugh!
Hey, you. <cf>Did you hear about the attack on the Duchy of Barnhart by the dragon tribe?
Barnhart has a strong knighthood. <cf> But even they had a hard time.
And the dragon tribe also attacked the holy place of the Buffalians.
What's going on in the world? <cf>...... I can only plow the fields, but I'm worried.
Have you ever heard of avaritia?
It's a monster from a fairy tale! <cf>It's very strong and very scary!
I wonder if the monster the adults were talking about was <cf>Avalithia?
No one believes them, but I'm sure they are! <cf>Because it's a huge monster, isn't it?
<cf>Lately, the livestock are getting scared of monsters. <cf>That's not a very good sign.
Livestock are sensitive. <cf>They are sensitive to the slightest change.
They're not going to give us good milk if we don't do something about it.
But it's our job to do something about it! <cf>We'll deliver good milk to the world, don't worry!
The minster wheat is doing very well. <cf>If we don't do something about it, we're going to catch too much.
<cf>Well, if we get too much, the price will be too low. <cf>We are in danger of a price collapse.
Fortunately, minster wheat is a specialty of this village. <cf>It's a variety that's not produced anywhere else.
<cf>I guess we don't have to be too pessimistic, though, since the price won't collapse that much.
<cf>The big tower you see over there, it's the ruins of Buffalia, you know. <cf>It's called "Ruins of the Giant Tower.
It's been there since I was born. <cf>My father said it was there when he was born too.
It's still full of mysteries, and sometimes adventurers go there to investigate. <cf>I think a priest named Wahlkin was investigating it too.
<cf>This is a big place for me, I see it every day. <cf> Yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
There's a variety of bitter carrots. <cf>It's just so bitter, and it's my favorite variety. ......
This is, by golly, a goblin's favorite!
When I grow them, goblins come to me. <cf> That's why it's forbidden to grow them.
I wonder if my taste buds are the same as goblins. ...... <cf>Sometimes I get nervous ......
Do you know.　Minsterhorn was the name of a <cf>test farm.
A guy named Minsterhorn <cf> built a test farm named after himself.
The test farm became more famous than the village, so <cf>the village was named Minsterhorn!
That's nice. <cf>I want to do something that will go down in the village's name, too!
Huh. <cf>That priest Wahlkin is in trouble, isn't he?
<cf>When Grandpa told him about the lore from long ago,<cf>he asked questions one after the other.
<cf>It's a strange priest to get excited about lore, isn't it? <cf>He looks unreliable and ......
But he's probably a nice guy. <cf>Because he looks so happy.
Are we going to "Claws of the Giant Dragon"? <cf> Watch out for the 'flux' in the back.
He looks like an ordinary monster, but he is strangely black with red eyes. <cf>It has a strange atmosphere, something like this: ......
It's far more ferocious than your average goblin or landfox.
<cf>The Flux is distinguished from ordinary monsters. <cf>You'll know it when you see it.
Also, rumor has it that there are a ton more <cf>monsters further in. Be careful.
Beyond here are the "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon. <cf>The ruins of Buffalia are under investigation.
An unidentified monster is appearing now. <cf>It is dangerous to go exploring alone.
At least have a skilled adventurer accompany you.
Oh, dear, have you come to pay your respects too? <cf>I hope it brings you good luck!
I've gained a lot of weight recently, <cf> so I thought I'd ask you to help me lose it.
[<cf>I was going to ask for help to lose weight, but my husband was sarcastic and said, <cf>"If you're asking for help from the gods, you'll only get what you want!
I came here today to <cf>petition</cf> my husband to get fat!　Ahhhh...!
Did you hear that?　Did you hear that big noise up there?
It was a very loud noise. ......<cf> I hope it wasn't a harbinger of bad things to come.
Ha!　Could it be that <cf>God is angry</cf> because I prayed for someone's misfortune......?
<cf>I'm in trouble! <cf>I'll have to go to the shrine again and apologize to God!
Are you an adventurer? <cf>So you came here to pray for a safe trip?
Many adventurers come to Lalparu to pray for safety.
But be careful if you buy a good-luck charm.
Some merchants may try to get you to buy strange items just because they have good luck.
It seems <cf> like something happened up there.
Maybe there was an incident, but I don't think you should get involved.
<cf>The sacred site of Kamigakari is a holy place for the Buffalians. <cf> It is also the territory of the priests.
<cf>They would not be amused if adventurers intervened in a problem that arose in their sacred place.
What is it?　I'm not really interested in Buffalianism.
She wanted to come with me, so I had no choice but to go with her.
She's a fan of the divas. <cf>She wants to tell me how great she is. ......
<cf>I'd rather have a stylish date in the city than worshipping in the countryside like this. ......
<cf>She's making a big deal about something glowing at the "Mihashira" in Kamigakari.
It must have been lightning anyway, right? <cf> I don't think it's a big deal.
I'd rather rest now. ......<cf>I'm exhausted from all the walking.
I'd love to have dinner somewhere close by, just the two of us. <cf>We should at least do something a little date-like......
Ha...... divas are so nice, aren't they? <cf>I wish I could be like her......
<cf>The Buffalians value singing. <cf>The divas sing chants at the Star Festival.
But my boyfriend doesn't seem to be interested in either the divas or <cf>Baphalianism</cf>.
I wonder why he doesn't find me attractive. ...... <cf>I'll have to be more persistent in my proselytizing!
Hey, you saw it, didn't you? <cf>There was a flash of light at the top of the [mihashira]!
I also saw something flying toward the top!
And he wouldn't take me seriously, saying it was probably just lightning or something!
I knew it wasn't good to keep going like this. ...... <cf>We need to do more proselytizing.
Totally, all of them. <cf>All the worshippers these days don't know the etiquette.
Worship is not about making requests. <cf>God is always watching over us.
First of all, we should give thanks for our daily life in peace and quiet, and ask for His continued protection.
But nowadays, people are making convenient wishes <cf> before God. It's a lamentable story at all. ......
You see what I'm talking about! <cf>God is angry!
I have heard it all. I heard a terrifying roar emanating from the "Mihashira," or "Pillar of the Gods.
It was because the worshippers had forgotten their daily gratitude, <cf>and had only imposed their selfish wishes on the gods!
They will be punished <cf> sooner or later by God</cf> for their continuous mistakes. ......
Hi, I'm visiting the shrine with my mom. I'm here to pray with my mother. <cf>Buffalian worship!　Isn't it great?
We pray to the Buffalian Gods!
The Buffalian God has gone to the sky, hasn't he? <cf> How did they go there?　It's amazing, isn't it?
I wonder if I can go to the sky someday like the Buffalian God?　I'd like to go!
Hey, hey!　I saw something amazing!
Something flew over the top of the "Mihashira," or "Pillar of the Gods"! <cf> It was glowing, and it was really bright!
<cf>Then there was an amazing sound! <cf>A very loud bang!　A loud, booming sound!
What was that?　Is it the god of Buffalia?
Here in Larpal, you could say that this is the town in front of the sacred "Mihashira" (the pillar) of Kamigakari.
You can <cf>see</cf> the "Mikabashira" from here, too, can't you?
<cf>The town is crowded for its size because of the large number of worshippers who visit.
The large number of people praying <cf>encourages our Order's guards</cf>.
What a relief! Are you also taking seriously the <cf>rumors</cf> that the dragon tribe is attacking the holy place?
How can that be? <cf>It's just a rumor. Ralpal will be fine.
The god of Buffalia would <cf>not</cf> allow such a thing!
Just a rumor. Rumors!
There would be no such thing as a dragon tribe attack. <cf>There are still many guards like this!
The Order Guards are all very diligent. <cf>There is no way they would allow an attack!
<cf>You must not be misled by such rumors.
If others ask you about this, <cf>tell them it is just a rumor.
<cf>The entire building, including the tower, is a legacy of Buffalia.
However, the statue of the founder of the Buffalo-Brahman faith in front of the building......<cf>was not there in the beginning.
It is said that after the founder passed away, <cf>the people of the time added to it.
He must have been a very beloved person.
The "KAMIGAKARI" [Mihashira] is very beautiful. ......
Around Lalpar, you can see the "Kamigakari" pillar from anywhere <cf>, but ......
From here, the cliff is in the way, so you can't see the <cf>"Mikabashira".
I like to look at the "kamigakari mihashira," so <cf>that's a bit of a pity!
This area is the shopping district of Lalparu. <cf>Isn't it a busy shopping street for the size of the town?
Because not only the residents of Lalpar, but also those who come to worship <cf>visit this shopping street.
That's why we <cf>have a lot of goods for travelers and adventurers.
You might want to take a look around the stores too.
Did you <cf>hear about the attack on Berkmar a while ago?
Berkmahl is a <cf>settlement in the valley east of here in Lalpar.
Rumor has it that it was attacked and destroyed by some unknown monster.
It's a scary story. <I'm so scared I can't sleep.
You see over there?　Under the cliff. <cf>That's the settlement of Berkmar.
I think it's better to call it the ruins of Bergmar. ...... <cf>It's all abandoned.
<cf>There are stories that it was turned into such a mess when monsters appeared. ......
What kind of monster could appear and <cf>turn an entire village into ruins? ......
I talked to a priestess for the first time! <cf> She was very nice. ......
<cf>The oracle priestess. <cf> She is a very important person in the Buffalian faith.
<cf>I was in L'Alpar with a pilgrimage group of the Buffalians.
If only you had come a little earlier, you would have met <cf>the priestess</cf>.
I was a little surprised <cf> when the pilgrims came out of nowhere.
Usually they don't come this time of the year.
...... I wonder if it has something to do with that.
You know, Berkmar's. ...... <cf>It's scary, really.
<cf>I hear that a Bafarian pilgrimage group is on its way to Berkmar.
I'm very grateful to hear that.
I have relatives in Berkmahal.
I hope that the pilgrims will pray for me as well.
The other day, a pilgrim group stopped by Lalpar, and <cf>I had a lot of trouble!
Some of the guys were complaining about the pilgrims. <cf>There was a bit of a stormy atmosphere.
I think it's probably because of the Bergmar incident.
People are worried. <cf> What is God doing?
What was that thing you were talking about earlier ......?
No, it was just a huge sound. <cf>It was like when a huge thunderbolt struck.
The sound was in the direction of the mihashira. ...... <cf>It doesn't sound like anything.
Hmmm, maybe I heard it wrong.
I told you I really saw it! <cf>I'm not lying!
For a second, there was a shadow on the ground. ......
I looked up at the sky, and something flew by at great speed!
Which way did it go? <cf>I'm pretty sure it was the "Mihashira" from "Kamigakari"!
Hey there, fellow. <cf>Are you heading this way too?
Then be careful. <cf>I hear it's pretty dangerous down there.
Well, I don't see what's wrong with that.
<cf>You and I are both adventurers because we enjoy that kind of thing.
Did you come here to accept a request for this mansion, too?
If so, that's too bad. I'm the first one to accept your request here.
I get paid a lot of money just for guarding the mansion.
How could I pass up such a lucrative offer?
<cf>I thought Lalparu would be a more prestigious place, <cf>with the "Mihashira" of Kamihagari so close by.
But looking at the stalls like this, <cf>it seems like a pretty normal town.
Look at this. <cf>Cookies and wooden dolls!
...... Is it a normal town or a <cf>touristy place?
The young man there. <cf>How about a bottle to accompany your trip?
You can drink it or pour it. <cf>You can be sure that any wounds will be healed in no time!
<cf>The ultimate holy water purified by the oracle priestess. <cf>This is a precious item that can only be purchased here.
<cf>It's a bit pricey, but it's absolutely worth it. <cf>It is definitely worth it!
<cf>The best souvenir from Larpal is these "Ojashira" cookies!
<cf>They have a rich buttery flavor with a mild, soothing wheat taste!
You look at me and say, "That's just an ordinary cookie! <cf>They even come with the blessings of the Buffalian gods!
Not quite as good as ......! <cf>They're delicious!
Oh, sorry. Sorry, adventurers. <cf>The store is still in preparation.
<cf>As I get older, it takes me longer to prepare.
Now, I have to close the store when it opens so I can get home in time.
......? <cf>When do I sell my goods?
You have a good selection of vegetables. <cf>They go best with my steaks.
Hmm?　Adventurer. <cf>If you've earned your money, <cf>I recommend the "Strongest Beef Pavilion" where I work.
Ralpal's Kiraki beef is a premium brand. <cf>Everyone wants to eat it at least once before they die.
And I will serve you meat that lives up to its reputation. <cf> A taste worth telling your children and grandchildren about!
Maybe they're replenishing the guards? <cf> You look like an adventurer from a pioneer station.
What, no? <cf>As you can see, we're rich.
<cf>That's thanks to generations of <cf>faith in the gods of Buffalia.
But that's why we have to hire adventurers to guard our house.
Now, take a look at this. Our vegetables and fruits are not like the rest of the land.
We grew up in a field overlooked by the "Mihashira," <cf>hearing the voices of the divas.
And this year's crop was bountiful and tasted great! <cf>They really are God's beloved crops!
You can cook them right up and eat them, <cf>or give them as souvenirs!
I'm Dr. Volker from the hospital, and <cf>my kids are afraid to get patched up.
<cf>He's a good doctor, but he's a bit of a mess. <cf>I'm having a hard time getting him to stop hurting.
<cf>And those subtle jokes and giggles. <cf>The kids have a bad reputation.
<cf>I'm grateful to the adults, though, because they're honest and don't misdiagnose.
This is a very tense situation. <cf>Will you listen to me?
What's in the taru of this cart is milk. <cf>But it's from a month ago.
They left the leftovers from the last stall stacking up and left it there<cf>.
Is it rotten or is it yogurt? I<cf>...... haven't worked up the courage to open it yet.
I don't know......<cf>what in the world to do......
My chickens have escaped. <cf>As you can see, we have three chickens.
I caught one with my right hand and one with my left, and <cf>I was about to start on the third one when I realized that ......
You realize you don't have a shot. <cf>I've done that ten times already.
Oh, you are an adventurer, aren't you? <cf>Welcome to Larpal, the home of the [mihashira] of [kamigakari]!
This is the town where many pilgrims come to catch a glimpse of the "Mikahashira".
You've already seen it, haven't you? <cf>It is a great structure that no human hand could have built.
<cf>It has become one of the most important holy places as an unquestionable proof of the existence of God.
<cf> It's a very crowded place. <cf> It's very different from Litze!
You want to know about Litze? <cf>It's a small village in the mountains.
You can find it by following the road all the way to the east, in the Montenol valley.
It's a bit far, but it's a nice village, so <cf>you should visit it if you get the chance.
Just up ahead is the "Mihashira of Kamigakari". <cf> Isn't it imposing!
You see it, don't you? <cf> A magnificent statue in the shape of the founder of the Buffalo-Brahman religion.
The entrance is at the foot of it!
Well, <cf>normal people can't go in there, though.
You can't go in there. Sorry about that.
Ha, oracle priestess ...... Suteki ......
O priestess of the oracle, the one who delivers the word of the god of Buffalia. <cf> You don't think I don't know that!
She is the symbol of Buffalianism, the one who is at the top of the heap! <cf> And yet she's so lovely and fragile, like she wants to protect you. ......
Oh, how can I be like that? ......
Looks like you can't get through.
Are you from Lalpar too? <cf> I'm seeing more and more people using that street over there.
It's well-maintained, busy, <cf>and you can carry your stuff safely.
I'm really glad it's not a beast of a road. <cf>Thanks to you, even an impotent person like me can come here safely.
Well, today's work shooooooo! <cf>Let's go back to Larpal!
Yo, I'm at work right now. Bouncer, you know. <cf>Let me know if there's anything out of the ordinary, okay?
There's a lot of bloodthirsty bastards here. <cf>I'm on call if there's any trouble.
<cf>There's talk of banditry in the area. <cf>Be careful, will you?
<cf>I work like that all the time. <cf>Bouncers are a lot more work than you might think.
<cf>Welcome to Ritze village. <cf>Have you come from Lalpar?
<cf>Thank you. <cf>There are many cliffs around here, aren't there?
<cf>This leads to the Evergreen Desert. <cf>Many people stop here to rest before continuing on.
It is ...... good for your back ....... <cf>The seven-colored water is good for old people. ......
Are you an adventurer? <cf>The hot springs at Hotel Limestone are great......
<cf>Soaking in the seven-colored water and drinking sake while looking at the scenery. <cf>The best luxury. ......
The hotel there is frequented by adventurers, <cf>they never get tired of telling us stories about their travels!
Asterlys, I like it. ...... It's cool. ...... <cf> It's a big city, man.　I'd love to live there. ......
<cf>I'd love to live in a big city...<cf>I'd love to live in a big city...<cf>I'd love to live in a big city...
Boy meets girl, right?　<cf>I should start practicing my singing now!
Let's go to Asterlys and come back big! <cf>It's already been a year since I thought of ...... ...... haha ......
There's a lot of metal work in this village. <cf>Men and women can't afford to eat.
<cf>They work with metal and craft metal. <cf>I hear that there is a lot of demand for these jobs.
People come from outside the village looking for work.
I'm going to work hard and earn a lot of money!
I think there are jobs for adventurers, so if you want money, why don't you look for one?
I'm going to be a great adventurer in the future!
I'm going to find a lot of treasures and become very rich!
Yo, adventurer there. <cf>How about some freshly picked mountain vegetables?
Look at those tasty looking mushrooms. <cf>We get a lot of them in the mountains around here.
They go great in soups, stir-fries, and everything else. <cf>They're crunchy, crispy, and very tasty!
How do you like it? <cf>Mushrooms will be the meal of the night!
Would you like a woollen coat, guest?
It often gets cold here, <cf> with the cold winds blowing in the valley.
The wool from the sheep that grow in such places is fuzzy and <cf>very good quality wool.
How about a pair for the winter? <cf>I highly recommend it!
Would you like to try some vegetables from Montenol?
If you are an adventurer, I recommend potatoes. <cf>They last a long time, so they make a great travel companion.
<cf> but freshly picked vegetables are the way to go! <cf> Enjoy the crispy and crunchy vegetables!
Phew. That's depressing. ......
I don't like crowds. <cf>That's why I'm disqualified from being a peddler, I'm often told.
The road I'm on my way to Salamzat is <cf> a place with a lot of people coming and going!
Commercially, it's an important place, and there are many peddlers who commute from Asterlys. I don't like it.
No, you can't. <cf>At the moment, the gates are sealed.
I can't give you the details, but it is for diplomatic reasons. <cf>It will be for some time yet.
<cf>This is a very important barrier, <cf>even though it is at the end of the earth like this.
I feel very proud of my duties here.
You know, <cf>beyond the barrier is a desert area.
Even if you're an adventurer, <cf>you'd better be careful!
<cf> Humans are the best food for starving monsters.
Have you ever been to Salamzat?
It's an oasis town in the Evergreen Desert just down the road.
It's a totally different vibe than Asterlys. <cf>I think you'll get a taste of a new culture.
How's it going?　How's life as an adventurer going?
Well, it seems like you've been to a lot of places. <cf>No, thank you.
The world is a big place. <cf>Walk on your feet and see for yourself.
There is a sacred place called "The Soundless City" just ahead. <cf>We are the Order Guards who guard there.
But there was a little accident. <cf>The holy place is now in a dangerous state.
We had no choice but to pull up here, <cf>and we're working on countermeasures.
Just a few minutes ago, there was a guy running <cf>alone</cf> towards the "Soundless City" ......
Things are a bit dicey in that area right now.
I hope everything is ok. ......
That monster......<cf> is beyond our ability to handle.
We have no choice but to abandon that place. ......
I've just escaped with my life from a monster in the Soundless City......
Oh, I didn't run away, I just followed orders to ......<cf>evacuate. Yup.
Come to think of it, we passed an adventurer on the way. ...... <cf> You didn't mean to say you were headed for the "Soundless City"?
The commotion in Avaritia is over thanks to you guys. <cf>Thank you.
<cf>We will continue to be on alert, however, as the situation could become dangerous again at any moment.
But <cf>the "Soundless City" is a strange place, isn't it?
It used to be a city called "Andorra"<cf> though it was destroyed in the war and lies in ruins. ......
Not long ago, there was a huge explosion underground, <cf>and it's been under the control of the Order ever since.
They're not sure what caused it.
Or if they do know, they can't disclose it: ......
Oops, I'm done talking about this.
You guys beat that thing!
You're not as impressive as you look!
But if we were saved by an adventurer, <cf>we've lost our face.
I guess we're going to be getting a lot of heat from now on. ......
This is the "Soundless City" back here.
We've been ordered to remain on alert.
I'm <cf>relieved</cf> that the young man has recovered safely!
But still, how did he end up in that place ......? <cf>Did he know he was dealing with avaritia?
In any case, that young man. <cf>He looked like no ordinary man.
Is the desert next......
...... Huh?　Oh, no, I'm fine! <cf>I'm not tired!
We are trying to save the future. <cf>I have to work hard too!
Oh, no. <cf>I can't get a guarantor right away.
I used to be so lax about checking the customs.
<cf>You don't have to be so tense just because Dunkirk-sama is here.
He's the commander of the most powerful knighthood of mankind, isn't he? <cf>If something happens, Dunkirk-sama will take care of it.
Oh dear. ...... <cf>Would you be willing to take on a guarantor or something at the Pioneering Bureau?
The Duchy of Barnhart is in some kind of trouble.
The dragon tribe attacked us, and the Duke has fallen. <cf> I hear that Master Dunkirk is practically in charge.
Even though he is the strongest knight, politics is not his specialty. <cf>Is there someone to assist him?
Hey, listen!　I made eye contact with the priestess!
What?　Don't you know? <cf> The pilgrims passed through here and entered the desert.
But the priestess is surprisingly young. <cf> I was so surprised!
That's just a child, you know? <cf>And yet, it's so hard for her to walk all over the place!
<cf>If you want to pass through the customs, you'll need a certificate of guarantor.
<cf>You need a certificate of guarantor. <cf>Please go through the confirmation process here.
We cannot let you through until it is done. <cf>Please understand.
Once you pass through this barrier, <cf>you will be in the Evergreen Desert!
If you are going, please be prepared. <cf>Don't underestimate the desert!
Are you guys going to Salamzat?
It's nice there. It has a unique atmosphere, <cf>I even travel there every year!
It's a town built in a desert oasis. <cf>There is something very comfortable about the waterfront.
<cf>Only those who have traveled in the desert can understand that feeling. <cf>I'd love to discuss the charms of Salamzat with you!
How are you doing?　How are you?
<cf>"Sap of the spiny dogwood" is all that is needed to repair the Imagine Seed.
You can find it in the Ritze Trading Post in the Montenegro Valley.
Hey, what are you doing? <cf>You're going across the barrier into the desert, aren't you?
I've gone to the trouble of vouching for you, <cf>so don't waste your time, okay?
I heard you went to Salamzat.
Unlike Asterlys, I'm sure you found many unusual things there.
Here, take it. Take it.
Oh?　You bring me souvenirs, <cf> that's a thing that happens.
I was just contributing to the economy.
You know, I lent you the money in the first place.
If you don't like it, I'll ask for it back.
<cf> No silly, it's a souvenir from a very beautiful girl. <I'll be damned if I don't accept it.
Don't talk like a creep!
Ha-ha-ha! <cf>That's what you always say.
<cf>A little advice in return for your Salamzat souvenirs.
<cf>Be careful in the Evergreen Desert, there are many ruins and caves<cf>that can be dangerous.
The Pioneer Bureau may give you a strong warning. <cf>If you're not good enough, don't go near them carelessly, okay?
Ah!　You guys, thanks for that time.
I know you're going to be in Salamzat for a while, right? <cf>You should definitely come see our troupe perform!
They are all amazing performers! <cf>Of course, my songs are the most popular. Heh heh.
Looking forward to it! <cf>I'm looking forward to seeing you all too!
Come on, come on by! <cf>Here's a performance by the Gilwet Traveling Troupe!
<cf>Miss Charlotte, the hottest diva in town, and other skilled entertainers will enliven the desert city!
A moment of rest and relaxation in a beautiful oasis! <cf>We invite you all to join us!
Come on, come on, Zilwet Traveling Troupe! <cf>The Gilwet Traveling Troupe!
Did you see the "Gisai-fu"?
It must have been a magnificent thing. <cf>Only in Salamzat can you see it so clearly!
I think it is the most beautiful in the world. <cf> "The winds of light and color" are the specialty of Salamzat.
Hey, adventurer. Haven't you been asked to find a lost child? <cf> That's because... ......
I saw an unfamiliar child playing with my [son]. <cf>Maybe he's a traveler or a pilgrim.
She was dressed like a shrine maiden, and her hair was a pale green. <cf>A very floaty looking girl.
Oasis attracts good people and bad people, you know. <cf>I'm a little worried.
I think I <cf> saw the oracle priestess a while ago: ......
I'm sure she's feeling <cf>open-minded</cf> after coming to Salamzat.
I've heard that pilgrimages can be tough, and <cf> it's good to take a break once in a while.
I'm sure Master Einlein is somewhere in this city.
<cf>Whenever I take my eyes off of him, he goes wherever he wants to go. <cf>We are having a hard time too!
If he is the head of the temple, he should be more patient.
So, I'm sorry, but please <cf>look for Mr. Einlein.
That's the Barnhardt Knights, isn't it? <cf>They were so polite and nice.
Especially the leader, Mr. Dunkirk! <cf>I admire his dignity.
He is so different from my husband. <cf>I wouldn't have left him alone if I were a little younger.
So that's the Knight Commander Dunkirk we've heard so much about.
He's so great that he's acting on behalf of the king, isn't he? <cf>He's an official representative of a state delegation.
<cf> He's even doing Salamzat a favor. <cf>I'm thrilled that you came all the way out here.
What's the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart doing in the desert?
No, I know they came as an envoy. <cf> They've been in and out of ruins all over the place.
I don't know what their purpose is, but <cf> I don't think it's just a courtesy call.
What?　You met Dunkirk? <cf>Where?
Oh, oh, ......<cf> I believe that was the "Mushitoride of the Dawn", wasn't it?
He saved our lives, <cf> didn't he, my servant?
What was Dunkirk doing there?
How would we know that?
But you said something about an investigation ......
Investigation ......?
What?　You're really into this, aren't you?
Oh, no, it's ....... Things are a bit crazy these days, aren't they? <cf>I'm a little concerned myself.
In addition to the Salamzaat meeting, <cf>the Knight Commander's personal investigation at the insect stronghold......
I don't think it's related to the attack on the duchy, but <cf>I've been busy.
There's a troupe of traveling entertainers here right now. <cf>You should check them out if you like.
It's called the Gil Wet Traveling Troupe,<cf>and they're very popular!
Oh, I'm looking forward to it. <cf>I've been waiting for this day for so long!
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! <cf>This is the moment I've been waiting for!　It's finally here!
The Zilwet Traveling Troupe's performance at Salamzaat! <cf>I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for this day!
<cf>Of course, this is who I'm looking for. <cf>The diva of the troupe, Charlotte!
Her clear and beautiful voice is truly a miracle!
You should see it too. <cf>If you don't see her, you will definitely regret it!
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!
Soon, the Gil Wet Traveling Troupe will be performing!
There's a diva who sings really well. <cf> She has a really nice voice!
Run, run, run, run, run...<cf>I want to be a diva in the future too!
You are not an adventurer around here. <cf>It must have been hard for you to come to Salamzert, wasn't it?
<cf>I was also a bit nervous when you suddenly told me that I couldn't use my pass.
I heard that Dunkirk is coming to <cf>Salamuzat</cf>.
I guess they don't want Dunkirk to get hurt <cf>. ......
If there's a bandit who can wound that man, <cf>I'd like to see him.
I've seen him fight in the Principality, <cf> but a normal person couldn't even touch something like that.
My sister's song was a buzzkill! <cf> Good for you!
I wish I could go to the Star Spirit Festival in Asterlys. <cf>A star spirit diva sings, right?
I wonder if a diva is a more amazing singer than her sister. <cf> I'd love to hear it!
That story is boring, sis. <cf>She told the story for me.
<cf>I fell down. <cf>I almost cried because it hurt so much.
Then my big sister came to me. <cf>She told me a story to take my mind off things!
But the story was boring... ......
Hey! You were with a nice lady earlier! <cf>What's up with them?
What, are you trying to pick up girls?
No! I didn't see any familiar faces. <cf>And I'm all about the mullies, you know?
Hmmm......... that's right!
Would you mind sneaking a look at them? <cf>...... they're a bit more dangerous than you'd think.
...... have their reasons, don't they?　OK! <cf>I'll take you up on your request, of all people!
But where did you meet these girls?
The long-haired lady's dress is <cf>unny, I've never seen anything like it before. ......
Oops, no prying, sorry!
What, now we're going to Salamzat?
That's an oasis town in the Evergreen Desert. <cf>There's also a lot of trade with the Asterries.
The exotic atmosphere of the city makes you anticipate new adventures. ...... <cf>Adventurers should visit there at least once.
You can help the girl who took the bait.
It's just down the road to the left!
I'm asking you!
<cf>This area is off limits to the Knights of Barnhardt, as they are currently investigating.
Under the command of the Knight Commander, <cf>they are surveying all the ruins in the area.
It will take a while to complete. <cf>I'm sorry, but we're going to have to ask you to divert to another road.
This is also our mission. <cf>We ask for your cooperation for the time being.
The Knights of Barnhardt are investigating beyond this point.
<cf>No one is allowed to pass, as we have a direct order from the Commander of the Knights.
We are aware that there are ruins here. <cf>Originally, our purpose is to investigate them.
As adventurers, we understand your desire to enter the ruins.
<cf>We ask that you wait until we have completed our investigation. <cf>This is my job too. Sorry about that.
Hey, where are you going? <cf>Wouldn't you rescue the decoy first?
This site is to be <cf>investigated by the Order of Barnhart.
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to ask you to stay out of the way for a while.
Hi, are you looking for Charlotte too? <cf>I'm looking forward to it!
I wish I could be like Charlotte!
Contrast, dance, street performance, <cf>I knew this troupe was the best!
Charlotte is just down the road at the entrance to ...... town. <cf>That way, they ran away......
But the attackers went that way too. <cf>Please!　Please help Charlotte!
I know because I was in the same troupe! <cf>I can't lose that girl's song in a place like this!
And yet ....... <cf> Damn, why won't it move, my leg. ......
Looks like there was some kind of commotion. <cf>There's a little traveling entertainer who ran away in a hurry.
<cf>I think we were being chased by a group of armed men. <cf>That many people for one girl. ......
There are not many guards in Salamzat. <cf>They must be busy defending the Temple of Buffalia.
Here, theft and violence are solved by the adults around you. <cf>So, someone has to help that girl too: ......
I don't have long to live. <cf>The only thing left to enjoy in life was singing. ......
<cf>What a disservice. <cf>I would take her place if I could.
My ancestors....... God of the Buffalians....... <cf>Please, whatever it takes, may he be spared.
You can have <cf> as much of this old man's body as you want. ......
Sure, Salamzat is a bloodthirsty place, but <cf>that was crazy!
To attack a place so brazenly in the middle of a performance, that's crazy!
Was there a reason for such urgency? <cf> or ......
Salamzaat is being licked! <cf>Does he think it's okay to make a scene?
<cf>I was so scared! <cf>My legs were shaking......
I'm an aspiring hunter. ...... <cf>It's no good being stuck at the critical moment. ......
<cf>What are they doing here, those guys? <cf>What were they after?
No way, I'm one of the most ordinary men in Salamzat, <cf>they were after my ordinariness......
Were they trying to kidnap me and turn me into an ordinary bandit! <cf> Oh my god!
Damn, this is not good! <cf>I should be more like a normal person and less frightened!
Ummm. <cf>That's a hell of a thing for people to do, attacking this oasis!
It is against the law for desert people to raid a town or an oasis. <cf>Even wild thieves don't do that.
You're dealing with people who don't even care about the law. ......<cf> They wouldn't hesitate to kill people or worse.
What in the world would happen to a kidnapped diva? <cf> Honestly, it's frightening to even imagine.
Hey, adventurer. I have no position, no money, no power,<cf> but I'm asking you.
<cf>Can't you help her out?　If we don't, <cf>not only will she suffer, but everyone in the desert with a conscience will suffer.
That's the look on your face when you want to know <cf>where the outlaws who are chasing the ...... girl went!
They ran out of the oasis. <cf>Hurry after them!
That girl's terrified face......<cf>You can't leave her alone!
Already!　If only they hadn't asked me to wait here, <cf>I'd go!
What the hell?　Some scary guys just ran outside after one of the girls.
Is this some kind of clan festival? <cf>Maybe it's some kind of big wedding celebration.
...... Huh!　A raid! <cf>No, that would be bad!
Charlotte fled to the south, pursued by them! <cf>Please, help me ......
Please, you have to help her.
We have to help her, we have to. ......
There might still be bandits lurking around there. ......
...... let me handle it here. <cf>You guys, that girl!
I'm worried about Charlotte. ......
Please go to her as soon as possible.
Senpai, please take care of Miss Charlotte! <cf>I will get Lady Erinse to a safe place [--].
I will chase after her right after that!
Nah, what's going on! <cf> Oh, what the hell are those guys ......
No, it's not that, it's Char. <cf>They were after that girl: ......
Oh!　Adventurer! <cf>Please help our Char!
Traveling troupes are always in danger, but <cf>I've never seen anything like this before......
The young men followed them, but <cf>I'm worried about them alone. ......
Adventurers, can you help us? <cf>Please help Charlotte!
She's as good as our daughter.
Oops. Looks like we won't be getting any additional performances. <cf> I was relieved to hear that the diva was saved.
Well, it's a traveling troupe of performers, so I guess it's inevitable. <cf>I guess they can't move the show to the next town or something.
Maybe next year when they perform in Salamzat again? <cf>I'm looking forward to it, she had a lovely voice.
She'll probably be even better next year. <cf>That's all I can say: ......
<cf>I'm a little disappointed that we didn't get to hear her voice and singing all the way through just this year.
Charlotte, ......<cf> That girl is a guess, hands down!
Back and forth across the rough desert. <cf>I, a humble peddler, have seen an angel!
Charlotte-chan is the moisture of life. <cf>An oasis appeared before the dying traveler!
I will do my best to support you in your next performance. <cf>Will you join us?
After seeing a traveling performer on stage, <cf>I feel like after a vivid dream!
Even the unchanging everyday life feels fresh. <cf>I like that, as well as the stage.
That's why I come to see the cleanup like this. <cf>I like to enjoy the aftermath.
This dream got rough in the middle, though. <cf>I hope next time I'll be more at ease.
I'm <cf>wary that some of the guys from earlier might be lurking around.
I'll be damned if Charlotte and her friends are going to get attacked again.
I'll have to protect them this time. ......
Oh, did you hear that? <cf> Dunkirk is in Asterlys.
<cf> I mean, he's just stopping by on his travels, though. <cf>A public visit would be a big deal.
<cf> He's come to eat at the "Kaito Kaito". <cf>The beautiful vice-commander is with them.
<cf> Why the hell is he at the Quartermaster's, that bastard? <cf>He should have thoughtfully chosen the Coin Pavilion.
However, if he had come to our house, <cf>he would have gotten into all sorts of trouble. ......
Thank you <cf>so much for helping Charlotte!
She's a very responsible girl, <cf>I hope she doesn't get too worked up about this case: ......
Hey everyone. <cf>Thank you so much for helping Charlotte!
The boy wants to leave the troupe for a little while. <cf>After all that's happened, it's not too much to ask: ......
If I had been more firm, <cf>I wouldn't have frightened that boy.
I heard that. <cf> Charu was worried about us, so he went into hiding somewhere?
You're a silly girl. You don't have to worry about it. <cf>We're like family.
Totally ...... I should make <cf> her favorite food to make her want to come home early!
She'll come home to the smell of food. One of these days.
Don't you know anything about that? <cf> about the old man I've been seeing a lot lately.
He's either praying, or when he's not<cf> staring at one passerby after another.
I once asked him if he was looking for someone,<cf> and he laughed sadly, shook his head, and said
["[I can't stop looking for someone who shouldn't be there ["]"]. <cf>I wonder what he meant by that?
That man, now he's being left alone,<cf> but when he was young, he had a hard time, you know.
<cf>I heard that he got caught doing some crazy research at Mihashira, and he was forced to come here.
What?　Who? <cf> The old man who comes here every day.
But still, I can't believe that <cf>things</cf> appear in the desert like this. ......
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I just can't stand that thing. <cf>Ugh, I can't even imagine ......
Usually I try to keep <cf>scented oil</cf> on hand to keep the thing away, not the insects......
Flowers are so precious in the desert. <cf>I doubt I'll be able to get new ones.
How about. <cf>Do you think you'll be able to find "Flowers of the Sand and Wind"?
<cf>I don't know how to thank you for your kindness to this old man's selfishness. ......
<cf>You are good people. <cf>Just being able to meet you has made my life worth living to this day!
The place Elektra mentioned......<cf>"Ruins of Boluom", I think.
Ruins of Sand, Path of the Wind: ....... <cf>There might be ...... "Flower of the Sand and Wind" there: ......
Defeat Avaritia, please ......
If we don't, we won't be able to continue our pilgrimage and <cf>everyone is anxious about it......
We've been looking around the city, too, and <cf>what an amazing place it is!
Even in such a harsh environment, it is bustling with life, and <cf>everyone is full of life!
Where we live, although comfortable, <cf>none of the places we visited were so lively. ......
There was a [kosai-fu] blowing a while ago, but <cf>it seems to have subsided</cf>.
[<cf>The winds are the winds that blow in the desert. <cf>It's very sparkling and beautiful.
But the sand flies with it, and visibility becomes poor.
So when the wind is blowing, <cf>you have to travel more carefully.
What, <cf>that some ruffians tried to kill a girl in the desert?
Bandits and thieves are everywhere, but <cf>attacking a traveling entertainer's stage</cf> is curious.
They would avoid such a high-profile move.
Some kind of shady organization on the move? <cf>Thanks for the info, I'll check it out too.
Hey, that's interesting information. <cf> There have been an increasing number of dragon tribe sightings in the Evergreen Desert.
They were just over in Salamzat, right? <cf>Let me know if you notice anything.
There's also the ones who attacked the diva. <cf>I don't see any connection between that and the dragon tribe, but ......
Anyway, be careful. <cf>You never know what's lurking around the corner.
Huh? <cf> The priestess of the Buffalia cult was a dragon tribe!
And they ran into Voldigen again. ...... <cf>Hey, isn't that something great?
Still, I'm glad you're safe. <cf>Hard luck, but good luck surviving!
The experience of fighting the dragon tribe is great ze? <cf>I think the atmosphere has become Big, if you don't mind me saying so!
...... Electra was a dragon tribe?
Yes,......
<cf>The dragon tribe is those who avenge God. <cf>They are the unforgivable, the incompatible, the unforgivable.
..................
...... sometimes scared me, but <cf>I didn't hate Elektra!
Have you seen the market? <cf>You should take a look around, it's interesting.
<cf>There are all kinds of stores open by people who are trying to make a break in the business.
<cf>You may be surprised at how many stores sell strange things!
Sometimes you can find unexpected treasures.
Why don't you go around the market like a treasure hunter?
I came here today to buy some textiles.
<cf> Look at all the colorful fabrics that adorn the city. <cf> Aren't they beautiful?
I try to decorate it with different colors according to the season. <cf>This kind of thing is a lot of fun, isn't it?
Now, what color should I choose next?
I wonder if there are any goats for sale anywhere.
It was my son's 10th birthday. <cf>I'm going to celebrate it in a big way!
...... Oh, and when I say celebrate with a goat, I don't mean <cf> eat it!
When he turns ten, we give him a goat and let him take care of it. <cf>That's the nomadic tradition.
Salamzat is a town that was formed by the indigenous people of the desert and <cf>the immigrants from the outside.
<cf>There are many conflicts. <cf>The settlement authorities and the Buffalians mediate, but it's not easy.
It's a very difficult issue, with traditions and customs and all that.
<cf>It's also affected by the situation in Barnhart, <cf>so it's a surprisingly complicated town. Even this.
You adventurers are from across the desert, aren't you?
That's nice~. That's amazing! <cf>I wonder what's out there in the desert?
I want to go there someday too!
<cf>Did you see the ruins in that endless desert?
I don't know when it was, but <cf>there used to be a thriving city there.
According to the lore of Salamzat, <cf>it was a beautiful city!
I wish I could have seen it with my own eyes, just once.
How about some fresh fruit?
Plenty of juice. <cf>This is the best way to quench your thirst.
You might not think fruit in the desert, but <cf>it's possible to pick it around here too!
It's all a blessing of the oasis. <cf>Thank goodness!
Would you like to buy some exotic and unusual goods? <cf>We have clothes, jewelry, perfume. Take a look!
Not interested?　Don't say that. <cf>You might just meet your destiny!
I've found these things in all sorts of places.
Hey, you're an adventurer, aren't you? <cf>You're not from Salamzat, are you?
In Salamzert, it only rains once in a while, <cf>just a little bit.
But it doesn't in other places, does it? <cf>I wish I could go there.
And is it true that sometimes white, cold stuff <cf>does fall?
I dream of traveling there someday and seeing <cf>that cold stuff!
Whew, that's quite a sale today. <cf>After all, business is about location, too.
This city has a lot of travelers and is a good place to do business, but <cf> not all of the city is good!
<cf>Where you set up store makes all the difference in the number of customers. <cf>You know what I mean.
That's why it's so hard for street vendors like us to compete for space.
Have you eaten in this town yet?
I'm a street vendor here and there, but <cf>I like the food here the best.
The nomadic lamb meat, cooked <cf> with a lot of spices</cf>, is just delicious!
I <cf>recommend</cf> eating it with thin bread made from corn flour!
In this city, strong warriors are respected. <cf>There are so many monsters outside the city!
It's amazing that people can beat them!　<cf>That's why adventurers are so respected. <cf>That's why we welcome adventurers!
The next most respected people are craftsmen who can make things. <cf> clothes, carpets, glassware, and so on.
My parents are merchants, so I'm helping them, but <cf>I want to be a cloth weaver someday!
This is the Temple of Buffalia.
Salamzat has its own belief in ancestral spirits. <cf>But it is still the Buffalian faith that has the most followers!
We, the priests, are also trying our best to pray for the believers who visit us<cf>!
But there aren't too many priests. ...... <cf>It's a long way from the Holy Land. ......
Oh, sorry. It's nothing, so <cf>please don't mind me!
I go to this Buffalia Temple <cf>every day to pray!
If you pray every day, <cf>I'm sure the God of the sky will hear you!
But I would also like to visit the big temple someday, and even the <cf>"Mihashira," or the "divine pillar.
It must be a very divine place. ......
I hear that the number of dragon people seen has increased, and I hear some disturbing stories.
The most important thing to remember is that the city is not a place to be worshipped, but it is a place to be visited by people who want to be respected.
I hope no dragon tribe will come near ......
This is a pretty interesting city, man. <cf>Outside of the city is a desert and all you see is sand......
<cf>There are many things to see in the city. <cf>This scenery is different from other towns, isn't it?
<cf>There's plenty of food for the adventurers! <cf>Don't forget to check in with the Pioneer Bureau!
Hello. Are you an adventurer? <cf>Is this your first time in Salamzart?
Salamzart is a town centered around an oasis on the edge of the Evergreen Desert.
It is the halfway point on the <cf>trading route between Asterlys and the Principality of Barnhart.
That makes it easy for people to get together. <cf>There are many adventurers and merchants.
I'm sure you can get all sorts of things here. <cf>Please, go check out the stores.
<cf>And I'm sure there are many adventurers who would like to lend a hand.
Hey, hey. <cf>When I grow up, I want to be rich and I want to be a strong warrior.
<cf>which do you think is more likely to come true, <cf>the wish to be rich when you grow up, or the wish to be a strong warrior when you grow up?
I want to put one of these wishes in a balloon. <cf>But can't both come true at once?
Which wish should I put in the balloon? ......
Are you a traveling adventurer? <cf>Have you been to the waterfall yet?
<cf>It's the coolest place in town!
It's like an oasis, really!
But it's where everyone uses it. <cf>Directly bathing in the water is not allowed!
Are you a traveling adventurer? <cf>Let me tell you something about the Salamzat way of life.
Don't even think about stealing in this town.
You mean like in any other town?　Maybe so, but <cf>not here</cf> in particular.
If you're caught stealing, you'll get <cf>busted</cf> by the townsfolk who are there. Remember that.
Are you a traveler?　This town is fun. <cf> Look at those balloons.
<cf>These balloons are all over the city, and they have wishes on them.
When you have a wish, you write it on a stone and put it in the balloon with <cf>an offering.
Then, when the wish is granted, <cf>the balloon's string is cut!
I still deal in all kinds of products, but <cf>my dream is to deal in the most exquisite gemstones.
Salaamzad is a big jeweler, so I want to save up some money and open a big jewelry store with the best jewelry artisans.
<cf>I want to open a big jewelry store with the best craftsmen. <cf>I'm going to put up a big gemstone necklace as a centerpiece.
Well, I haven't found the gold yet, I haven't found the craftsmen yet, and I haven't found <cf> the big jewels yet!
Adventurer, how about this fabric? <cf>I can tailor clothes for you if you wish.
It's a crystalline silk fabric, a specialty here in Salamzat. <cf>How do you like it?　Isn't it beautiful?　It's so soft to the touch.
And the colors! <cf>And the colors!
Want to look around the rest of the place?　Too bad. <cf>Our cloth is the best!
Adventurers? <cf>The sun must be hard to beat in this city!
On top of that, it's this hot!　I'm used to it, but <cf>the nights get much cooler!
<cf>Salamuzat's way is to take a rest in the shade before you feel the heat.
<cf>The water tastes good. <cf> Oh well, I can finally take a rest.
Ouch. My back hurts. ...... <cf>This desert trip is becoming more bearable. ......
I'm getting used to it, but <cf>the desert trip is still hard.
You're carrying a heavy pack, chugging limited water, and <cf>fearful of the sandstorms that are coming!
When I see Salamzat across the road, <cf>I'm relieved from the bottom of my heart!
The water in the oasis looks like it's bouncing off the light and glistening. <cf>I really think it looks like a gem!
Hey there, adventurer!　Aren't you tired?
This is the resting place of Salamzert. <cf>It's literally an oasis for everyone's soul!
We don't take Lunos, you know. <cf>Rest to your heart's content!
Oh yeah, and don't get carried away and go into the water. <cf>I don't want to drink the adventurer's broth!
Have you ever heard of "whispering cliffs"?
I went there the other day to test my mettle with my buddies. <cf>That's a scary place ......
I thought I heard a cold whispering voice <cf>from the bottom of the high cliff ......
It's true!　I felt like I <cf>heard</cf> it! <cf>You be careful if you go, too!
Wow, wow! <cf>Are you an adventurer by any chance?
You know what? I've never been outside the city, so I don't know what it's like out there.
So I've been wondering <cf>I've got a question for you: ......
Is it true that there are <cf>wolibos bigger than mountains out there in the city!
Gah!　You're lying! <cf>Dad fooled me again. ......
Oh, you came to visit again? Good, good, good.
There are a lot of hunters around here. <cf>Get to safety before they find you.
<cf>I see now that you are not a horned goat, but an adventurer. <cf>I've been making that mistake a lot lately. Please don't be offended.
Mr. Guido is a strange man, isn't he? <cf>I hear he's a detective. ......
Every time I see him, he asks me, "[Is there a case? [<cf>"Is there a case?
<cf>I haven't had a single case. <cf>I wonder if he doesn't have a job.
Don't detectives usually show up <cf>after</cf> a case has happened?
There's an old saying in Salamzat, <cf>'Tomorrow has a song for tomorrow.
If today doesn't work out, there's always tomorrow. <cf>The opportunities are not endless, but they will come every day.
<cf>It would be a shame to let today's failure hurt us so much that we can't sing tomorrow's song.
Yesterday is yesterday, today is today, tomorrow is tomorrow. <cf>Love each new day with all your heart.
<cf>You think our tent has a plain pattern. <cf>I used to be a lot more flashy.
It had my face embroidered all over it. <cf>I know, it makes your heart shiver just thinking about it, doesn't it?
But I got complaints from all over that kids would cry when they saw the tents. ......
Now it's just a safe pattern. <cf>I guess my sex appeal was too much for the kids. Ha ha ha!
Welcome! <cf>This is the Imagine Institute.
<cf> Don't be fooled into thinking this is a laboratory in the desert! <cf>The facilities are all state of the art!
...... Well, every city is up-to-date!
Hello. It's another beautiful day for crafts.
This is the Craftsman's Square in Salamzat. <cf> You can use the kneading rituals at your disposal.
The Evergreen Desert is a <cf>desert, and the monster life is unique.
<cf>Get your hands on rare materials and craft new weapons!
I've never been to Salamzat before, but <cf>it's a really nice town!
The food is good!　The people are jolly! <cf>Clear and understandable climate!
<cf>It's like the city was made for me! <cf>I've decided to make this my base of operations!
<cf>I've been concentrating on my crafts and I'm starving. <cf>I think it's time to get something to eat!
<cf>I've come all the way to Salamzat, <cf>I'd like to try some of the local specialties!
I believe Salamzat is famous for its meat dishes. <cf>Meat after craft!　Yeah, maybe it's not so bad!
I've been to the "Mushitoride" in Akatsuki,<cf> and it's still a creepy place no matter how many times I see it.
<cf> The "Mushitoride" in Akatsuki is a huge nest of insects in the east. <cf> Monsters that look like bugs are everywhere.
Unless you like bugs a lot,<cf> I don't think it's a comfortable dungeon for you.
You ever heard of <cf>The Ruins of Boluom</cf>?
It's a very unremarkable ruin where you won't find any Buffalian legacy.
<cf> Sometimes miraculous treasures are born due to the mysterious power of the wind that blows through the ruins.
<cf>But it's said to be a very rare phenomenon, so it's a waste of time and effort to enter the ruins for the sake of treasure.
I've been going there for about five years now, and I've seen the results. ......<cf> What the heck?　What's wrong with being romantic?
I was attacked by bandits and a hunter saved my life. <cf>The hunters in this town are so strong.
Maybe I should quit being an adventurer and become a hunter too!
Hey brothers!　Are you doing good? <cf>This is Salamzert's settlement office.
<cf> Isn't it very different in appearance from the other buildings in town? <cf>There are many adventurers who don't even know it's a pioneer station.
<cf>I'm standing here to show them around.
If you want to get a job, come inside and visit ....... <cf>I don't need to explain that much, do I? Good luck, brother!
I was admiring the kids as they ran toward the pioneer station, <cf>thinking they were reading a book or something,</cf> when I saw them running toward ......
<cf>They went straight into the back of the tent. <cf>Goodness gracious!
I guess that's where the bad kids <cf>have their hidden playgrounds.
<cf> Well, the best thing for a child of the desert is to be cheerful. <cf>Bad boys, bad boys, good mischief, all right!　Ha ha ha!
In this town, they are thankful for rumble-boats. <cf> Because in the desert, rumblebores dig in the sand.
They do this to find veins of water in shallow places. <cf>They can't live without water either.
Maybe because they have a good nose, <cf>they find water veins well.
So the rumblebore is the beast that brings water. <cf>You hunt them, you get fur and meat. It's a bargain creature.
If you go east through the Evergreen Desert, you will see a cliff. <cf>In the center of the cliff is a place called "The Hermit's Fountain.
<cf>A recluse lives at "The Hermit's Fountain. ...... <cf>It is said that a recluse lives in "Hermit's Fountain," but the truth is not known.
Even the locals seldom go near the place. <cf>Some people go there from time to time, but the purpose of their visit is ......
Quite frankly, it's a lovers' rendezvous.
This city is too open. <cf>It's hard to find such a place.
I may look like this, but I used to be popular.
When I was an active hunter, all I had to do was kill a sand viper and <cf>yellow screams would echo through the city.
In this town, warriors and hunters are especially respected. <cf>Now, adventurers are respected as fighters, too.
Is that me now? <cf>...... I wish I had married back then.
<cf>The sand viper is a monster that has no place to go. <cf>It can be eaten if you de-poison it, and the poison has its uses.
Moreover, if you soak them in certain herbs, the poison will denature. <cf>The denatured venom is used as a tonic and is delicious.
The skin is also strong and hard, resistant to drying out. <cf>It is used to make belts and boots!
It's even considered a blessing of the desert. <cf>Of course, be careful of the poison when hunting!
Light flowers, sand wind flowers, and moon flowers: ....... <cf>All of these beautiful flowers are said to be found in the desert.
The desert is a harsh environment for people. <cf>If we let our guard down even a little, we could lose our lives.
<cf>So, at the very least, I want the flowers to bloom so strongly and beautifully that they will not be defeated by the desert.
That thought is what makes beautiful flowers bloom in the desert. <cf>......
Hmmm, nice colors. That's the cloth I dyed. <cf>The sun has given it more and more texture.
How do you like it?　Adventurer. I'm sure no other pioneer station in the city has such a magnificent tent.
<cf> What, it wasn't a tent to begin with? <cf>A whole stone or wood building?　What?
You can be so extravagant! <cf> People in other parts of the world are so strange!
<cf>The nappos are so energetic in this hot weather!
<cf>They're in Salamzat, too, Korokoro. <cf>They come out everywhere!
Sometimes they dry up and roll their eyes.
But, if you throw them in an oasis, they'll be back to normal. <cf>We're good, aren't we?
Look at this!　Yee's stuffed animal. <cf> Isn't he cute?
My dad bought it for me at Asterlys. <cf>It's my treasure.
The oracle priestess is the most powerful person in Buffalianism.
Only the priestesses can hear the voice of God. It's a wonder.
I wonder if the Buffalian Gods are good singers too? <cf> If a priestess heard them, would she tell us?
<cf> What's with the difficult face? <cf> You're a customer, aren't you?　See, I laughed, I laughed!
I'm just thinking about it. <cf>I've got a lot on my mind.
<cf>I don't know what's going on, but if you look like that, <cf>you're not going to get any customers.
Please, smile. <cf>I'm the one who's going to be in trouble if this place goes under!
Hey!　I'm the one who's in trouble. <cf>...... you son of a bitch!
<cf>......　Welcome!　Welcome!　<cf>Welcome!　......Welcome back!
...... not quite the same. I wish there was some kind of <cf>phrase that was unique to the coin-operated pavilion.
I'll talk to Jake about it. ......
Hey, Master. Take me with you. <cf>I'd like to return the favor to my mentor now, when he's in trouble!
Thanks, but I'll save that for later.
No, but [--]
Now doesn't seem to be the time, Carveen. <cf> I bet there's only so much we can do.
Right?
Mm. <cf>You keep your skills sharp for when the time comes.
...... Yorke's right.
I understand. But if you need me, just let me know. <cf>I'll be there to help you.
Hey, you, <cf> what the hell is up with this pendant?
I think it's a clue ...... to my parents. <cf> He was holding it when he was found.
I'm an orphan. <cf>I've been through a lot, but since the troupe took me in, I'm happy.
But still, when I look at that pendant, I feel <cf>I had a mom and dad. ......
You may have been a diva, you may have been a diva, you may have been a ......
...... simple, but I thought if I became famous, <cf> I could meet my mom and dad, you know...
Can I have something as important as that?
Such an important thing, okay?
You guys have saved me twice<cf>I'd be happy to return the favor with this.
You can help Erinse, can't you?
What is it about "oracles" that suddenly ......, <cf> just pops into your head?
...... because I was "made" to!
Was ...... it?
But lately it's been strange. <cf>...... more than one, like there are
......Nothing. I only deliver oracles.
Oh, oh?　Good luck. <cf>Sometimes I have a question for you
Which is your true love, ...... Carveine or Yorke?
......?　They are both dear friends. <cf> They are both very kind and ......
I see. So you're too kind to see them as the opposite sex.
Is that good?　Always be sensitive to people's sexuality. <cf> You never know when something might become a deal breaker.
See, just like Jake the other day, right?
...... I just wanted to know if you simply wanted to know...
Ho-ho-ho!　That's exactly what I'm talking about!　<cf>There's nothing more interesting than hearing about other people's flirtations!
I can't seem to help you now, Master. ......
<cf>I will definitely return the favor someday! <cf>When that time comes, don't hesitate to ask for help!
If my pendant will help you, go ahead and use it!
...... I was only obeying the oracle!
If I can be of any help to you ......
I thought I would try a little harder than usual.
Like you, <cf> I'll do what I have to do now.
There are many things I would like to discuss with you, and <cf>we should set up a time to talk somewhere!
Take care. <cf>Good luck to all of you in your fight.
I never thought this would happen, you know. ......
What? I mean Barnhardt. <cf>I can't believe that the Duke was assassinated: ......
But I'm sure the Knight Commander, Lord Dunkirk, <cf>will do something about it.
Do you know?　Rumor has it that the murderer of the Prince is fleeing here.
If we catch him, <cf> there will be a big bounty on his head.
That's what I'm talking about! We'll be living happily ever after for our grandchildren!
Well, I'd be surprised if it's true!
Rumor has it that the assassin of King Barnhart is a member of the Order of the Knights.
Lord Dunkirk can't be too happy about that...
The death of the king means that it must be a state funeral.
How early do they usually hold it?
I have a bit of a connection to the Duchy of Barnhart, despite my appearance.
So I thought it would be a good idea to attend the state funeral. <cf>ohohohoho......
I heard the assassins are <cf>hiding out in the Asteria region.
It would be a disaster if they suspect we're harboring them. <cf>If this triggers a war, ......
<cf>I still can't believe that the great King Norbert is no longer with us. ......
But I have to accept it: ......
Perhaps, for the time being, Knight Commander Dunkirk will be at the helm of <cf>my homeland.
<cf>He's a bright man with a good family background, I hear. <cf> I'm sure he will serve us well.
Wow, I still don't have the right number of cargo!
Oh no. <cf>Because of the Barnhardt Knights, if the numbers are wrong, it can be quite a big problem.
Lately, the cargo bound for the Duchy of Barnhart has been a lot of Buffalo legacies.
It's all about the weight of the cargo, and we have to get it right. <cf>Ah, more annoying work!
I never thought the Duchy of Barnhardt would <cf>be like that......
It used to be a good country. ...... <cf>I'm a sailor, and I've been there many times.
The Barnhardt souvenirs were all of good quality and <cf>was much appreciated by everyone. ......
Even at my age, I'm still a connoisseur, <cf>walking around the world on my own two feet......
Let's not go to the Barnhart area for a while<cr>. <cf>Until things calm down.
It's another beautiful day, but ......<cf>I can't seem to clear my mind.
There have been a lot of scary incidents lately. ......
Hmm?　...... Don't talk to me for a second. Ha, ha, <cf>catching an assassin, ha, I'm doing image training.
What's with that face? I know you're anxious, but don't worry. <cf> We adventurers will definitely protect this town!
Huh?　A supplier? <cf>Barnhardt, but ......
Don't worry. Dad will be back soon.
If it's just the dragons, <cf>Barnhardt's in that mess too, right?
Oh, no, no. <cf>Somebody's got to do something about it.
...... They say Lord King Barnhart has been killed.
People are assuming it was one of his own people, but <cf>Yes, yes. We know.
We are the only ones who know the truth. ...... <cf>You know what you have to do ......, don't you?
You can't just kill the king out of the blue. ...... <cf> What are 'they' thinking?
It's the 'oracle priestess' of the Buffalian religion. <cf>It looks like she had a meeting with Lord Dunkirk in Salamzart.
<cf>But when she came back, she locked herself up in the temple because she had an important ceremony to attend.
<cf>I'm not at ease with the King of Barnhart. <cf>I have a feeling that something bad is about to happen.
I've seen you around a lot lately.
Where ......? <cf>Ehhhhhh, ...... various places!
...... the boy in the quirky white outfit?
Yeah, I saw that one behind the arena<cf>I don't know if he's still there or not......
...... Merlouf? <cf>I've never heard of such a name, but ......
Features are ......?
Whitish quirky clothes, light purple hair......<cf>Age is early teens......
Oh, by the way, I've heard that such a person <cf>often appears in the arena.
Mr. Dunkirk......I wonder if he was that scary.
I saw him in town, but <cf> he didn't look very approachable. ......
He had an air of ["]stay away["] all over him. <cf>You used to be so friendly and kind.
Oh no, I was choked up.
The Barnhardt Knights were here until the other day. <cf>It was tense and very inaccessible.
I know the country's in trouble, though! <cf>I wish they wouldn't drag us into it too.
My little girl, she's stuck at home.
I've been looking forward to <cf>Master Dunkirk, who I've always wanted to see, coming to our house. ......
When I called out to him, he just gave me a huge glare!
I don't know if he's the greatest knight or what, but <cf> he's a terrible man!　I can't believe it!
Adventurer!　Did they get him?
That thing, that thing! <cf> Some assassin on the loose or something!
That's scary, isn't it? <cf>I hope he's not hiding in this village.
I heard Dunkirk-sama came to Salamzat.
I heard there was some kind of meeting among the top brass.
I heard it wasn't a very good atmosphere.
Dunkirk-sama did a terrible thing.
I hope the Gods of Buffalia don't get their just deserts.
Things are getting very noisy these days...
I wish Berkmar and Barnhardt could spend their days with a little more peace of mind.
Everyone is praying to the mihashira every day!
Asterlys was a bit noisy.
There's talk that some assassin or other may have taken refuge there.
There's been a lot of that going on lately. <cf>I wish I could just relax and grow vegetables.
I've been wanting to go on a trip for a while.
<cf> The ferry from Asterlys has stopped.
I don't know the details, but it doesn't look good.
Have you ever heard of the Kingdom of Drava?
It was a country that existed before the Duchy of Barnhart. <cf> In the duchy, there is a research institute that dates back to that time.
<cf>The Royal Institute of Drava. <cf>It's an old facility that is still in use today.
<cf>The headquarters of the Buffalian religion is in the Principality of Barnhart.
The temple in Asterlys is also very fine,<cf> but the history is older in the Duchy of Barnhart.
<cf>It is said that the research facilities for the Buffalian heritage are more extensive there.
<cf>In the Buffarian Diocese of Barnhart, there is a facility called <cf>"Royal Institute of Drava.
It's a place where they do research on Buffalian heritage and technology, and <cf>they also cooperate with the Duchy of Barnhardt!
That's why the Order has its own equipment.
Hey! How are you doing?
What am I doing here?
My dad asked me to stay here. <cf>Totally, you're a real jerk.
Well, now that I'm in charge, I've got to do it right. <cf>Welcome. Welcome to the Two-Faced Coin Pavilion.
You want a meal?　Or would you like something to drink?
Make yourself at home. <cf>This is the adventurers' Oasis.
<cf>We can't afford to do anything sloppy now that we've taken charge of the Coin Pavilion.
For starters, I've been reviewing the ledgers, <cf>and they're not very clear!
The handwriting is dirty, the lines are distorted, and ...... ah, it's unforgivable!
The typeface is Clear and the borders are Straight! <cf>I'm rewriting this whole thing from scratch!
<cf>I'm rewriting the whole thing from scratch!
<cf>The Seido of Heavenly Blessings is a sanctuary originally reserved for oracle maidens and a limited number of others.
But you are special. <cf>Because you have been asked for your power by God through the oracle.
For us, the oracle is absolute.
The oracle priestess who receives and delivers it is the symbol of <cf>Baphalianism</cf>.
God watches over us. <cf> The oracle priestess teaches us this.
<cf>Hasten to the [seidō] of [the] Blessed Virgin. <May God bless you all.
<cf>To get to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings", please use the spatial transfer portal in the basement.
This portal leads to <cf>"The Seido of [Heavenly Blessing]".
Please use it.
The entrance is at the end of this ward.
Please, remove the monster inside. ......
I can only watch from here.
Please follow the oracle and guide us.
Thanks to you, the monster that is poisoning the cathedral has been removed.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Leave the matter of the "messenger of God" to the priestesses.
This spatial transfer portal leads to the temple of <cf>Asterlys</cf>.
Please use the portal in <cf>Asterleaze's Temple</cf> to return here.
This portal leads to the Duchy of Barnhart.
However, for various reasons, it is currently unavailable.
The [mitsuka] of God ......
You say that the priestess is the will of God, but <cf>can we just put it away with such a word ......?
I heard that soon after the messenger appeared, <cf>Bernhardt's researchers came.
I don't hear much good about that country these days<cf>I think things are getting a little fishy.
Oops, this is between us. <cf>I don't want to end up like Mr. Wahlkin.
Thanks to all of you, we were able to successfully ward <cf>"God's messenger.
[The "messenger of God" had been investigated by a research institute of the Principality at the request of the Diocese of Barnhart, but there has been no report since then.
There have been no reports since then. ......
With the assassination of the Duke and the appearance of the dragon tribe, <cf>they may not be able to do much about it.
[--]I can't help complaining to you people. <cf>I am sorry.
We may <cf>need your help again.
I would appreciate it if you could help me then.
I thought <cf>everything would be fine as long as I could get the avalitaire released!
I can't believe this is happening. ......
The effects of the Avalitia Shell are immeasurable, and <cf>Voldigen, the Dragon King, is still breathing somewhere......
We must find a way to save Tirith and save the future <cf>again</cf> from the ground up!
What will happen to us <cf> from now on? ......
Thank you for calming the [mitsuka]y!
If we get this close, <cf>we can hold the rest. ......
We don't know why or where the ......[messenger]came from!
If we should know, God will tell us. ...... <cf> If not, we don't need to.
Tsk ......! <cf>The guards' eyes are shining here, too. Damn!
Hm?　What the hell is wrong with you? <cf> I haven't done anything yet!
Oh, no, I'm not doing anything to the temple. <cf>That ...... thing you're talking about, I know someone who knows someone who knows someone!
Just get out of here and go somewhere else!
<cf>Are you going to the "Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon"? <cf>There are indeed reports of sightings of Avaritia nearby!
However, since it is rarely visited by people, <cf>the Order is not taking any action beyond surveillance.
The location is in the southern part of the Montenol valley. <cf>It is a corner of the "Galley Ridge Abandoned Road".
We have heard that the monsters in the area are ferocious. <cf>Please be careful.
<cf>Welcome to our home. <cf>Please pray here!
May your daily prayers bring you <cf>God's blessings.
Lady Einlein has been at ......
I heard there were quite a few injured. Some of them died: ......
What is the principality thinking?
This is a lie, of course!
I can't believe they would attack a holy place. <cf>Oh, how horrible!
O God of Buffalia, ......<cf>forgive these foolish people!
He said that the cult cooperated with the assassins: ......
They're not going to attack us because of this, are they?
What is going on in the Temple?
What will happen to the Order now?
I'm sure Master Lugerio will take care of it.
He is a man who has achieved an unprecedented <cf>rare</cf> ascension in the history of the Buffalian faith.
If we leave it in his hands, it must be all right!
This is unprecedented, isn't it?
If what the principality says is true, ......
Wow ...... what should we do ...... Kaa-chan!
The portal to Barnhardt in the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings has <cf>been sealed off!
However, it is only temporary. <cf>Is there any drastic solution?
<span size="Big">We need to arrange a ship ASAP! </>
Send a messenger to check on the situation. <cf>If we don't do something, this could turn into a war!
Request security for the adventurers, and arrange for additional doctors and medicines. <cf>Contact the Pioneer Bureau!
<cf>I know this is early in your assignment, but could you please report to the "Diocese of Salamzat" <cf>on the current situation?
<cf>Since that is also under Mr. Lugerio's control, <cf>let's ask for his cooperation.
It would be better if we could <cf>contact the "Diocese of Barnhart" from there. ......
The "Khartoum Ruins" are the ruins of an ancient city located in the <cf>center</cf> of the Evergreen Desert.
If you take the "Old Rainfall Road" <cf>east from Salamzat, you will find it on a high plateau.
It was once the central city of the region and the base of the <cf>Order of the Faith</cf>.
It is a place with which we are also familiar. <cf>These are the ruins of ancient Buffalia.
<cf>Anyway, gather accurate information. <cf>In the meantime, contact the Principality of Barnhart.
If we lose not only the main temple, but also the oracle maiden, the very survival of the Order will be at stake.
We will do whatever it takes. <cf>As soon as possible, contact the right person!
Hey, what's going on?　It's been a long time. <cf>How is your adventure going?
I'm going to be doing some research around here for a while. <cf>I heard about some interesting ruins!
I think they may be from a time <cf>older than the Buffalian civilization!
I have no choice but to investigate this! <cf>I can't wait to see what we find!
<cf>What a surprise! <cf>Our oracle's priestess is ......!
The deeds of the Duchy of Barnhart are against God. <cf> Now will come the divine punishment!
<cf> Our oracle priestess. Please be safe. <cf>We will never cease to pray to the gods!
 <cf>Yes, you hard-headed gatekeepers!
<cf>Yes, you stubborn gatekeepers! <cf>That you are so afraid of me revealing the truth about the visitors!
In this case, I will not choose any means. ......
<cf>I will write down in detail what the cult has done to me and bury it in this place!
Decades or centuries from now, someone who follows in my footsteps will <cf>excavate this letter</cf>!
Only then will the <cf>truth that the cult has been hiding come to light!　Justice will prevail!
And the meanness of the gatekeepers!　The meanness of the priests! <cf>I will bury everything here and leave it behind!
Ha ha ha ha! <cf>It's too late for regrets!
The door is tightly shut.
Due to an emergency, this area is now sealed off.
Carveen and Charlotte are supposed to be in <cf>"Kartoum's Sandstone Corridor" ......
I hope nothing is wrong ...... but ......
In order to rescue Mr. Einlein, we must go to <cf>The Principality of Barnhardt!
I can't be of any help to you. ...... <cf>Mr. Jake, I'm sure you're familiar with the situation.
I am concerned about Tirith, but <cf>I am even more concerned about Mr. Einlein.
Please, please help her.
How are you doing?　Did you find the sailor?
In this day and age, we're going to board the Barnhardt. <cf>Please get me some guys with hot Spirit!
When you've got everyone, come back here. <cf>I'll be ready to sail, Hurry up!
How's it going?　Did you hear anything useful?
I've been asking a lot of people, too, but <cf>I don't know how to sneak into a castle, as I'm sure you can imagine!
While we're at it, <cf>Carveen and Einlein are at ......
Let's hurry. We need to find <cf>any</cf> clue, no matter what it is!
Hey!
It's going to take a little longer on my end. <cf>Continue listening to the villagers!
Hey, welcome aboard! <cf>This is Dairitenshu, who was taken in by Jake!
<cf>I'll have the coin-operated pavilion daihanjyoed! <cf>Aukini, you're making a racket, aren't you?
What's wrong?　You think it looks bad?
No, no, no!　This is Saisin! <cf> Bad Guy Fashon!
It's a sturdy door. <cf>It can't be opened by force.
<cf>You said in your letter that the key was hidden in the abandoned mine at Alston, didn't you?　Come on, let's go.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
I'm not leaving without Jake and Charlotte.
I'm Andy.
I've known Jake a long time, <cf>he's heard a lot about you guys.
I've heard a lot about you guys. <cf>It's pretty rare for Jake to approve of something like that.
<cf>Good luck in the future!
<cf>Well, I guess we'd better get the rest of the people on the trading ship out of here.
Do you think you can make it to Barnhart Castle?
As far as I know, most of the royal palaces and other important buildings are equipped with emergency passageways.
A secret route that is not publicly available: ....... <cf>There may be one at Barnhardt Castle.
Of course, it would not be easy to enter. <cf>I think you need to find a key or something somewhere
<span size="Big">Oh, Kanaloa!　My hometown! </>
Look at this open road! <cf>It's not me standing around at a dead end anymore!
I got some good stories early on, too. <cf>They asked me if I wanted to use my experience at Asterlys!
I know what it's like to be frustrated. <cf>They said it's the kind of job they only ask people like that for.
If it goes well, they're going to offer me my next job. <cf>Well, that's a great start!
Thanks to you guys! <cf>My life is not over yet!
I hope Mr. Einlein is safe. ......
I hear that Mr. Carveen is also a prisoner. <cf>Stories of public executions are reaching us here as well.
Those people are innocent. <cf>Please help them as soon as possible!
I wish I could <cf>communicate with Mr. Dunkirk and Veronica and understand each other through words. ......
Have you finished your business over there? <cf>Oh here, I'm done sending the guys I want to cross over to Barnhardt.
[--]So, you got in touch with us through that route.
The seal on the letter is genuine. <cf>The route into the castle also appears to have been secured
Once His Majesty is present, <cf>we should be able to enter with impunity.
Make haste. Quickly and carefully. <cf>Continue to make arrangements.
But why has the Duchy of Barnhart suddenly turned against the Order?
Mr. Dunkirk has nothing but good things to say about his reputation. <cf> that he is a reasonable and honorable knight. ......
I can't believe that he would cause this <cf> without a reason.
Can we hear the <cf>truth from Mr. Dunkirk's mouth ......
It's good that the distribution has been released. <cf>We have a lot of work to do!
I'm going to collapse from overwork!
<cf> I know it's you, right? <cf>So you and Carveen beat Dunkirk together...
You're really impressive!
<cf>To defeat that Dunkirk, who was said to be the strongest knight known to mankind!
Well, I've known for a while that you were something else!
I never thought that Dunkirk-sama was the one who started the <cf>rebellion</cf>!
But I heard that Hugo was deceived. <cf>I'm relieved that he didn't plan it.
The Prince has come all the way to the castle to hear the people's opinion.
I came all the way to the castle.
It's a very good thing <cf> that the monarchy is taking steps that it hasn't taken before. ......
I've been sitting here in a daze, <cf>because it's not my turn to speak.
Well, I wondered what was going to happen at one point.
I'm glad Master Norbert is back......
I know you've been given permission to enter the castle by the High King.
Please don't wander around too much.
Listen to me!
I heard that the High King has given word that he will listen to the people's opinions.
I think I <cf>should</cf> go to the castle for a while too!
<cf>At the same time, there was a lot of commotion in the church. <cf>Something big has happened.
I hear that contact has been made with the Duchy of Barnhart. ...... <cf>We may soon have a solution!
Just ...... is this all over? <cf>I'm kind of getting a bit of a chest cold ......
<cf>We can't relax yet until everyone is back safe and sound.
Peace has returned to the temple. <cf>Oh, Lord!　We thank you, my friends.
This, too, is a trial brought about by the Gods of Buffalia. <cf>We are one, and we have overcome!
I hear that more and more people are neglecting their daily prayers these days. <cf>This may be God's condemnation of mankind
We must not forget to thank God. <cf>It would be good to pray again!
What?　Shopping?
Yeah, a little bit. I've been thinking about something.
I've been thinking about getting some new weapons.
After what happened with Carveen and Einlein, I thought, <cf>I'm not strong enough now. <cf> I felt like I'm not strong enough right now.
I want to have the strength to protect the people I love like you do. <cf>I want to gain the strength to not be defeated by difficulties.
It's not something that can be changed by weapons alone, though. <cf>I was just wondering if it would be a good opportunity.
So far, it's been to protect me from monsters, but <cf>I may have to fight a different enemy in the future.
I need to be prepared for when that happens. <cf>I have a feeling about that.
Hey! It looks like the Barnhardt thing has been taken care of.
<cf>Ostensibly Carveen is a major player, but <cf>I know what you guys have been up to!
<cf>I know what you guys are doing! <cf>So why don't you get it off your chest?
I've got a lot of work to do at the store. <cf>I'm not going to be able to show up at the pioneer station for a while, but you'll be there.
<cf>I won't be able to make it to the pioneer station for a while, but you're there. <cf>Tell everyone I said hi.
<cf>You can tell Mullie about Jake's big success, okay?　Nah?
Thanks for all the things you did for us ......<cf> and for helping us out.
Yoruk, and ...... for Dunkirk. <cf>............
If you say that was God's will too,......I'm ......
But ............
I'm worried about ...... Carveine. <cf>Call him if you want.
I'm fine. <cf>I'll keep an eye on Tillis, too.
Yes, I will. Bashlar is right.
Voldigen was made a <cf>test subject</cf> of the Avaritia Shell project.
The result was a failure, but <cf>now he plans to merge with the Shell of his own volition.
The goal is to bring the planetary beast under control,......<cf> which means he wants to make the world his own.
But in order to do so, they must take in a compatible <cf>me</cf>. ......
I will not be careless, but <cf>when the time comes,<cf>I will trust you.
We have been able to save you, Lady Einlein. <cf>We owe it all back to your efforts.
You are indeed God's chosen people. <cf>On behalf of the Order of Buffalia, I thank you.
<cf>The relationship between the Order and the Principality has been completely restored with the ceremony held by Prince Norbert.
The reconstruction of the main temple and the parish of Barnhardt is progressing swiftly with the cooperation of the Duchy.
Our faith will not disappear. <cf>The day will soon come when we will be able to deliver our prayers to God as before.
Oh, Master. <cf>Thank you so much for this opportunity.
I can't express it in simple words, but ......<cf>I've had a lot of things happen to me, and Master has helped me a lot.
My mother was taken away by someone and <cf>my father fell ill on the way to find her.
Still, there was Yoruk, and there was Einlein. <cf>Commander Dunkirk and Deputy Veronica both ......
So many people were there for me, and <cf>I'm sorry it had to come to this......
...... sorry. This is not the time to be whiny, but...
Master. You don't have to leave. <cf>I will always fight with you if you want.
Don't keep me alone. I promise.
You've really taken care of me on this one.
I'm following up on the case again, but you can check out ....... <cf>It seems the story was more deep-rooted than I thought.
The secrets of the Dorava Royal Institute in Avaritia. <cf>And there are reports that the dragon tribe was involved.
It will take time to unravel the whole story.
It's a case of this magnitude. <cf>It can't just be the sole decision of Dunkirk.
Perhaps there are still people behind the scenes who have been involved in this. <cf>You guys should be careful.
I can't just <cf> casually help you out like I did at the coin pavilion anymore.
It's inconvenient being king. Oh dear.
Oh, you are ......! <cf>Please come on through.
My fall saved this country. <cf>...... isn't it?
Without speaking too deeply, that is!
Because these women insist on <cf>standing up to keep the angel at bay.
I was left here ......
I've been thinking lately that a life like Mr. Wahlkin's isn't <cf>so bad.
Adventurer Anchan. <cf>Please deliver fish again.
This time it's not dried fish. <cf>Please hurry up and get them to the castle.
<cf> Don't complain all the time, move your feet!
That's impossible. <cf>A knight is a very important man, you know?
<cf> You're a Barnhart soldier, aren't you?
Knights are so cool, aren't they?
I'm going to be a knight of the duchy in the future! <cf> Isn't that awesome?
Dried fish, dried fish. Dried fish today, dried fish tomorrow.
I love dried fish. <cf>I could eat it every day and never get tired of it!
So, we'll have dried fish on our table tonight, too!
The sea is shallow around here. <cf>Big boats can't dock here.
That's why only small boats come here.
Ahhhh... I'm longing for a big ship, aren't I?
I'd love to travel around the world on a big ship someday!
Maybe even have a nice romance?
Hey there, travelers. <cf>How about some foreign fruit?
You don't see them around here. <cf>They're ripe and taste exceptional.
<cf> Look at me, look at me. <cf>Your skin will be so soft and supple!
Hey, there, customer! <cf>These colorful fruits are rare around here!
<cf>They come from across the sea! <cf>These fruits are from the resort town of Jubilia!
<cf>The other day a scholar came by to do some research on our way of life. <cf>It seems that our way of life is a historical document.
He said that a long time ago, this area was a separate country. <cf>They say it was called the Kingdom of Drava.
<cf>The festival songs and dances in the village are remnants of the Dorava culture.
Most of the men in this village would be fishermen. <cf>Because that's the most solid way to make a living.
While the fishermen are at sea, the women do the work on land. <cf>They make dried fish and dibon, and prepare for the festivities.
The young guys seem to aspire to be knights and castle soldiers. ...... <cf>You'll get to see how this village works sooner or later.
The twin kings bring bad luck. ...... <cf>That's the legend of Barnhardt.
The fifth Duke was a twin, but he was defeated by his brother. <cf> Famous as the last of the kings known as the "Ruthless Kings."
His twin brother was king during the War of Independence of Asterlys. <cf>There are a few more episodes.
It's just bad luck to say. <cf>That kind of thing is curious, isn't it?
Our Barnhardt Army, which prides itself on its military strength,<cf> places great emphasis on practical training.
That's why we wear out our weapons so much and <cf>renew them so often.
It's good that the military has a high level of awareness.
That's why the amount of weapons being discarded is so high. ...... <cf>Once, there was an incident where a gang of wild thieves armed themselves with discarded weapons.
The boats are very important to us fishermen, our lives are in their hands. <cf>We take good care of them.
We've been living on these boats for a long time. <cf>The people in the castle must be grateful for our fish!
I wish I could join the knight's school.
<cf>They have a retired knight teaching there. <cf> I'm sure I'd hear some great stories.
<cf>I hear they give you a "water bottle for the test", but what's a "test"?　Is it the name of a sword?
<cf> Look at this beautiful dyed cloth, made with Barnhart's traditional technique.
The colors are not too assertive, not like those of Asterleaze or Salamzaat.
Don't you think that <cf>these colors, which are not so strong as those of Asterries or Salamseert, <cf>remind us of the powerful history of this land?
'Canaroan' ....... <cf>In the past, it was only drunk in this village. ......
Now it's a popular divon. <cf>Even the locals can't drink it anymore.
It became popular with travelers and sold well. ...... <cf>They are not good for making large quantities.
Sometimes I miss the days when I could drink as much as I wanted.
<cf>Outside the village lie those who died fighting the dragon tribe. <cf>These graves contain the victims of a war that once took place.
<cf>For hundreds of years, the people of this land have fought against the dragon tribe. <cf>The ancient battlefield outside the village also conveys the ferocity of the battle.
<cf>Now that the knights have come to our village, we are at peace. <cf>We should be grateful to the men of the castle. ......
Barnhart is the largest nation on the Magna continent. <cf>Barnhardt is the largest nation on the Magna continent, though I hear it used to be much larger.
<cf>The third Duke, known as the "King of Invasion,"<cf> ruled over most of the Magna continent.
...... Since Barnhardt is that big, <cf>I'm not going to find out if I'm the only one slacking off here!
Eww, another fish delivery! <cf>I'm an adventurer! ......
Well, it's safer than fighting, <cf>so I'll take the job.
But hey, I'm getting tired of delivering all the time. <cf>I'm not a delivery guy......
Oh! If you're looking for sightseeing, ruins and old battlefields are popular.
If you're looking for food recommendations, fish is the way to go. <cf>Fresh fish is landed every day.
It's a nice village, enjoy yourself.
Peace is the best, I think to myself.
We should be thankful to the heroes who saved our country!
Hey, hey! This is between us. <cf>The other day I went to the Tower Rock mine to get some ore.
<cf>I found a path through a collapsed mine shaft, <cf>so I managed to go deeper.
And then I found these ruins that I'd never seen before!
[--]And this excitement is still mine alone. ......<cf>Would you like to go with me sometime?
Hey, hey, if you keep quiet about it, the cult will be very picky. <cf>You'd better report it to the settlement office quickly before they find out.
I remember there was a guy who wanted to keep the relics to himself and didn't report it.
The chief priest got angry, and there was a lot of tension between the cult and the settlement bureau.
The adventurer who didn't tell anyone got a good scolding. ......<cf>[--]That's you, isn't it?
<span size="Big">Oh!　What am I supposed to do? </>
......Excuse me, I'm distraught!
I am a spice shop in Asterlys. <cf>I came all the way to Barnhardt to stock up. ......
The liner stopped and I couldn't get back to <cf>Asterleaze</cf>!
No, the spices I just stocked up on are fine.
I'm just worried about my son I left behind in the store. <cf>I hope he's doing well......
I'll pretend I didn't see you come in from the outside,<cf> so you'd better leave here before you cause a scene.
Soldiers are stationed there too. <cf>If you stay quiet, you won't get caught.
<cf>so long as you don't cause a commotion</cf>.
How long will the <cf>export ban to Asterlys last? ......
I can't get my shipment to Asterlys <cf> for how long?
The sky is always cloudy around here.
We fishermen use the overcast to predict the fishing conditions and the waves.
We rarely see clear skies, but when they do, it's a bad time to fish.
The cloudy days are better for us.
We ain't killing nothing, right? <cf>The priestess and the knight, they ain't kids yet.
When in the world did this country become so <cf>barbarbaric</cf> ......
I hear it's almost time for Carveine's execution.
Damn, a knight of the dukedom, plotting to assassinate the <cf>king</cf>. ......
He's a real asshole!
[But you know, after the assassination of the Duke, <cf>Mr. Dunkirk and Mr. Hugo are very good at what they do.
Everything they did was right on the money.
I think we can leave the country in their hands. <cf> I think so.
<cf>Civilians aren't allowed in the castle, you know.
Of course I'd like to see inside the castle at least once!
In this day and age, you know?
They're not going to let you into the castle for a long time, and <cf>you'll get caught if you try to sneak in!
I'd like to make a delivery to the castle,......<cf> but I don't know what to do.
Just after the long break, I went to say hello to the Lord Commander, and he surprised me.
I knew everyone at headquarters had been screaming about how scary he was, like he'd changed.
His hair had turned white,......<cf>and that signature all-back style,......
[I know that everyone at headquarters was in an uproar,<cf>but I also know that his hair had turned white and that his distinctive all-back style had<cf>been replaced by a white one.
Dunkirk-sama loved Carveen <cf>like his own child</cf>, but ......
I never thought he would return the favor.
When I think of Master Dunkirk, I think of ......
Master Dunkirk may act stout-heartedly, <cf>but I'm sure his true feelings are very painful......
Oh, it's you. ...... <cf>Thanks for bringing me home.
But,<cf> look, look at this.
It's a dead end. ......
The guy who got you the job? <cf> Come on, ...... I don't know, I can't reach him anymore.
I thought there was hope for me back in Kanaloa, but <cf>I knew it was my life. ......
It's not your fault. I appreciate it, I really do.
But I'm not ...... anymore. <cf>Sorry. Leave me alone this time. ......
Welcome to the "Two-Faced Coin Pavilion"!
Thanks to you, the restaurant is thriving. <cf>Sales are even higher than they were when your father was here.
<cf> I'm so proud of you for even having business acumen. <cf>I guess I'm destined to be the top of the top no matter what I do.
Now, what's the Order? <cf>If you're just chillin', I'm back!
Oh, it's you guys. <cf>Have you had anything to do with the dragon tribe since then?
Was it Leanbrum, lurking in our home? <cf>That dragon tribe is the most troublesome type I've ever seen.
<cf>They're the most troublesome type of dragon tribe I've ever seen. <cf>We're still in the middle of rebuilding, and it's been a mad rush.
<cf>They can't even deploy their soldiers and knights. <cf>They tried to cut down the duchy from the inside.
<cf>I thought there were very few people with that kind of cleverness.
If you run into them again, watch out. <cf>The dragon people, they seem to be doing things differently now.
Mr. Tirith seems to be ...... asleep.
[<cf>The warding of Mitsuka is fine. <cf>We take turns putting up the wards.
<cf>We don't have to be here all the time. <cf>I want you all to take a break whenever you can......
I'm fine on my own. <cf>This is also the role of ...... the oracle's priestess, so
Gnnnnnnnnn......! <cf>I'm so close...... to solving the mystery!
Listen to me! <cf>The ruins I found the other day were really interesting!
We hired adventurers and camped on our own. <cf>I've been doing all I can to investigate ......
I'm one step away from running out of funds! <cf> Ah!　A great discovery is waiting for me right there!
<cf>I'm running out of money and people won't help me! <cf>The world is a bitter place!
I've got no choice but to go to ....... <cf>I guess I'll just have to make money from "that thing" after all these years.
You must really cherish that pendant.
Yes, I do. I wonder if it's the only clue ...... to my parents. <cf>I don't know.
Someday, I'd like to <cf>go find my mom and dad with the pendant as my guide.
Oh, I didn't know that. ...... <cf>Sorry!　That was tactless of me to ask.
Ah, yes! <cf>Then how about I lend you my pendant?
It looks almost identical, and <cf>I'd feel a little safer if you had it, wouldn't I?
Ha-ha-ha!　What are you talking about already. <cf> That's what Carveen gave you, isn't it?
My pendant and your pendant <cf>neither of them can be replaced!
So you have to make sure Carveen takes good care of it.
That's true. <cf>I said something that didn't make sense.
Anyway, don't lose heart. <cf> I'm here for you, and so is Einlein.
Hmm, thanks. <cf>That's sweet of you, Carveine.
Charlotte. That pendant: ....... <cf>It was a clue to finding your parents, wasn't it?
I don't mean to blame the masters, but ....... <cf>It's that ...... that's broken.
It's ok, Carveen. <cf>Thanks for your concern.
I may have broken the inside, but I didn't <cf>lose the pendant.
It's <cf>nothing compared to the fact that everyone is safe. Really.
...... Right. I'm sorry. <cf>I didn't mean to make light of your feelings.
Someday, when you're looking for your parents, I'll help you. <cf> Don't hesitate to reach out to me.
Yup. Thanks.
Aw, thanks. <cf>Well, have you seen our apprentice?
We've been doing research as we please, at our leisure. <cf>We often work separately.
He seems to be more interested in older civilizations than the Buffalian civilization.
<cf>It's good to be interested in your own way. <cf>If you imitate others in everything, you will never progress.
You say "master and disciple", but it doesn't matter. <cf>It is good to find your own way forward
But there is no tension these days, or ....... <cf>I don't know what it is, but I'm not in a good mood.
Oh well, I finally made it home.
I was stranded in Kanaloa. <cf>I was afraid of what I would have done if I had stayed there!
I wonder what the Barnhart Knights were thinking too. ...... <cf>It was a good inconvenience for folks like us.
It made my son worry too. <cf>I'll even be selfish for a while.
Dad is back!　Yay!
I wasn't worried at all, though, was I? <cf>It's just that the liner stopped for a bit?
<cf>A merchant like Dad is used to accidents like that.
Hehe, I'm glad to hear that. ...... <cf> Let's have lots of fun on our next vacation!
An adventurer who went to Cape Lawehala gave me a picture of a creature <cf>called a mermaid</cf>!
A big shark stands up and looks <cf> like a subhuman with a weapon as it is ......
Something different from what I thought it would look like: ......
We, the Zilwet Traveling Troupe, have decided to <cf>stay in Salamzert for a while!
We have been in the midst of some very noisy events, such as the Duchy of Barnhart, and we have decided to take this opportunity to take a break.
I thought this would be a good opportunity for the group members to get some rest.
Speaking of which, the Star Festival will be held soon, and <cf>some of the young people are going to go and see it.
If Char had been here, he would have been <cf>pushing me to take him to the Star Festival.
I was looking forward to seeing the divas. <cf>I think we can relax here this time!
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>How is Charlotte doing?
She can be a bit of a daredevil. <cf>Tell her not to do anything reckless.
<cf> Wasn't there a commotion in the Principality of Barnhart? <cf>I hope you don't get involved in that kind of thing.
Hey! <cf>Would you like a little taste?
It's a special☆Menu only available at the Hoshirei Festival!
We've been paying close attention to the ingredients, and the price is even more affordable! <cf>How scary that I have the business acumen to make it happen!
I've been thinking about it for a while, and I've got all kinds of ideas. <cf>Coin-tei will take the top sales position!
What!　The Seirei Matsuri has been canceled?
Gimme a break! Are you kidding? <cf>We've already ordered the ingredients!
You can't CANCEL it now!
What?　If you guys find a diva, <cf>we can have a Star Festival ......?
Tell me that as soon as you can!　So good!
I'm asking you ze!　The fate of Coin Pavilion depends on you guys! <cf>Good luck!
That armed group, it looks like they were hired for money.
I still don't know who hired them, but <cf>I hear they didn't just give up and walk away.
That employer, he must be a shady guy! <cf>He's been sneaking around, hiding in plain sight.
If I knew where he was, I'd go get him myself.
<cf>They'd be looking for you, not the other way around. <cf>Maybe that's why he attacked the masters.
<cf>Don't try to stand out too much. <cf>Your safety is paramount.
I know. But I'm ...... bummed.
God ......!　I really can't believe you were there......
I'm so surprised....... <cf>Because his voice is so different from the oracle's voice.
The oracle is much flatter and ...... colder, more like it.
But Mr. Ehrinze is different. <cf>It feels very gentle and warm......
I can't say this for everyone, but ...... <cf>I am happy to see God ......
Master ....... For me, it still doesn't feel real.
I can't believe that I'm free to go back in time...... past and future. <cf> It's so tremendous, I can't even imagine it.
That's exactly what God does, but ....... <cf>Is that possible for the Buffalian Gods?
...... Don't tell me, my mother too? <cf>Can it really be done if you are a Buffalian God Tribe?
No, I don't understand. ...... <cf> My head can't seem to sort it out.
I wonder if Yoruk could understand it. <cf>This kind of talk, he'd love it.
Far in the future...... this world is going to be destroyed.
I don't know why ....... Ever since I heard that story, <cf>I can't stop shaking.
It's thousands of years away, but <cf> somehow it feels like it's right in front of me. ......
Heh, that's weird, me! <cf>I don't think I'm that scared.
Um, ......!　I have a favor to ask: ......
I need a favor from God ...... and Erinze ......
Um, well, I'll keep it ...... to myself.
I want ............ your autograph. ............
God's autograph. I will treasure it. ......
I'll treasure it. <cf>Please do it secretly!
I'm not a [well, I don't know] about worldly things, <cf> but it seems that your singing voice is well received by the people!
I have heard many divas' voices, and <cf>they are as good as any of them!
Moreover, I didn't realize that you really have the qualities of a diva: ......
With all due respect, being a star-spirit diva is not a role that can be filled <cf>by a traveling entertainer.
Does Ms. Charlotte have some secret identity? ...... <cf>No, that would be too much of an evil guess.
It is all the will of the God of Buffalia. <cf> Let us take all possible measures to ensure that the Star Festival goes off without a hitch!
I heard you met with Hugo. <cf> They reported back from the other side.
He was a tough guy, wasn't he? <cf>He's a very brave and smart man.
<cf>He couldn't go against Dunkirk, but he was able to get around him.
<cf>Restoring relations between the Principality and the Order, supplying the Knights, and so on. <cf>The fact that we're getting around somehow is a credit to Yugoslavia.
I can't quite read some of the ideas, but you can read them at ....... <cf>Well, you're in good company.
Hey! How's it going? <cf>Did you find the diva?　Are you okay with the Seirei Festival?
...... one more? <cf>Haven't you confirmed it yet?
<cf>Are you sure you don't want me to run? <cf>OK! Music, Come on!
Hmm?　Do I need any special qualities? <cf>Okay. I was going to show off my beautiful voice.
No, on second thought, I can't leave the store empty. <cf> I'll leave you to it here!　Go for it!
In our time, the Star Spirit Festival was a phantom celebration that <cf>has long since ceased to be held!
There are records that there was a Star Spirit Diva, but <cf>we do not know who she was or how she performed the ritual.
I understand that Ms. Lalaforte, who was the previous diva, <cf>is in Cape Lawehara.
Please find her so that we can hold the Star Spirit Festival. <cf>I would like to talk to her personally.
<cf>The forest people are a subhuman race whose appearance and way of life are very close to that of humans.
We have had some interaction with them, including at Cape Lawehala. <cf>Sometimes children are born to both.
Lalaforte is one of them. <cf>Of course, one's origin has nothing to do with one's belief in God.
<cf>She has fulfilled her duties and served God well, both as a priestess and as a star-spirit diva.
She should be back in her hometown now, recuperating. <cf>I'm sure she would love to serve as a diva if she could.
It is all God's will. <cf>Please meet Lalaforte.
By the way, this is a pretty nice place.
There is a tranquility that makes you forget the hustle and bustle of the city, <cf>and yet there is the vitality of a growing city. ......
I'm looking forward to <cf> this place becoming a part of Bernhardt.
What a joke. <cf>We will not rule by force.
Our goal is to establish friendly relations. <cf>We are here on an inspection tour for that purpose.
It would be better for the future if you sell your gratitude to us. ...... <cf>Oops, now that was a naught.
I'll behave for the benefit of the locals. <cf>Please, don't worry.
Lalaforte's, nasty. <cf>You didn't have to make me sing all of a sudden.
You seem to be in a bad mood. <cf>I was a bit out of line earlier.
<cf> Don't be so cross with me. <cf>Your singing is not so bad either. ......
<cf>That's the thing!　It has a unique flavor,<cf> it's one-of-a-kind!
...... I said it was bad!
Oh, no!　I'm getting more and more bent out of shape!
This is no good. I'll leave him alone for a while.
I'm practicing my song at ............
He's gone all sulky.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
"Slime Moss" ...... please ......
Found ...... in the Valley of the Coral Rocks. ......
I am relieved to see that Tirith's expression has <cf>softened</cf>, if only a little!
I can't even <cf>imagine</cf> what she is feeling right now. ......
I'm so glad <cf>that the suffering has lessened, even if only slightly!
We must be <cf> very careful in order to rescue him properly.
First of all, let's hold a star ceremony.
I will take care of Tirith. <cf>Thank you very much.
I heard a very beautiful singing voice just now.
Oh, was it that woman's singing? <cf> That's amazing.
If she could sing like that, <cf>it must have been painful for her to lose her voice.
I'm glad your throat has healed. <cf>I hope one day you will be able to hear her sing slowly.
The political upheaval in the Duchy of Barnhart has subsided, but <cf>the wounds inflicted on the Order are not healed.
The two "Star Spirit Divas" who fell to the [deadly] blade ....... <cf>They will not return!
<cf>Only the "Star Spirit Diva" is responsible for the songs dedicated to the gods in the Buffalian celebration.
Even if they had no role to play, they were <cf> fascinating and irreplaceable figures!
It was taken away from them by the Duchy of Barnhardt. <cf>...... I still cannot accept it!
Please, may the two divas rest in God's hands.
The forest people are a <cf> subhuman race living in the Koaniani forests of the Outer Continent.
They are very close to humans and have been in contact with them since ancient times. <cf> Unlike goblins, they are highly intelligent and understand language.
They are a race of equals and friends.
They have many interesting characteristics. <cf>One is their youthful appearance and longevity.
They live for hundreds of years, and some of them have been trading with the Asterlys <cf> since the Asterlys became independent.
So maybe the diva Lalaforte will <cf>live a long life, too!
If she is the diva of the Star Spirit for many generations to come<cf> her name will be engraved in the history of the Order!
Lalaforte is a priestess of the blood of the forest people.
Although born into a different culture, she has a deep understanding of the Buffalian faith and is a model member of the faith.
She is also an accomplished diva. <cf>He even holds classes and teaches singing!
Sometimes I get a little overzealous in my instruction. ......
Hey, I see you found a medicine for your throat.
A unique medicine passed down to the forest people. ...... <cf> Well, no wonder we don't have it in our store!
Well, I thought we should have some in the future. ...... <cf>That doesn't seem to be in demand. What should I do ......
Hey, hey, that priestess Lalaforte, <cf>she's got her voice back!
The medicine seems to have worked. I'm so happy for her.
I think she's going back to Asterlys now. <cf>Buffalian priests are busy, aren't they?
Lalaforte, did you know that you are the "Star Spirit Diva"?
That must be tough not being able to sing. <cf>I'm so glad you're cured.
Are we going to have a Star Spirit Festival? <cf>Maybe I'd like to go listen to Ms. Lalaforte sing!
Oh, you're looking for little Lalaforte?
I'm sure she's renting a room at the "Pupu House". <cf> Just leave the village and go along the coast and you'll get there.
She's a nice, polite girl, isn't she? <cf>That's why I feel so bad that she can't speak.
Would you be willing to help her, adventurer? <cf>Please.
Lalaforte, you seem to be getting better!
I'm glad, I'm glad. <cf>I came all the way here to thank you, too.
[Thank you <cf> for sharing your fish with us. It was delicious.
<cf>We're both here for each other in times of trouble. <cf>I hope you'll come visit us again.
I think I found our third diva.
Go to the Minsterhorn. <cf>Lugerio will go first.
Charlotte is training with Lalaforte.
Not singing, but the rituals and greetings of the Star Festival. <cf>Ms. Lalaforte was very excited.
[I'm going to beat it into you until your body moves on its own, even if you're sleeping! <cf>Familiarize yourself rather than learn!　Feel rather than think! ["]......?
I'm in the basement over there, but <cf>no one is allowed in there, no matter how many people are there.
Sometimes there are tremendous screams and whip cracks, but ....... <cf>It's Charlotte. I'm sure she'll get over it!
The "Tower Rock Mine Site" was reported the other day, and <cf>the management of the site has just begun at the Order!
As is customary, a report should have been made to the <cf>Organization</cf> at the stage of discovering the ruins.
Apparently, some adventurers neglected to do so. ...... <cf>This is a total headache!
As for the "metal plate," we will keep it for now, but <cf>if there are no problems, we will return it to Myrlene.
It is for the sake of the Star Spirit Diva. <cf>Please investigate the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins", thank you!
Oh no, but I'm not the star spirit diva. <cf> I was surprised, but I'm honored.
I've been watching the Star Spirit Festival since I was a little kid myself. <cf>I've even admired divas for a while.
I've always loved singing and I'm good at it. <cf> Sometimes I even sing to earn money for research.
Oh, are you okay with that kind of thing? <cf>It would be bad if a star spirit diva sang in a bar or on the street, right?
Hmmm ...... Well, we can think about that later! <cf>Anyways, metal plate, metal plate!
Come on, come on, come on, come and get it! <cf>Ha~ Oh my gosh, now I'm looking forward to it!
The third diva ...... Myrlene, you say?
I'm glad you found someone who is qualified. <cf>I think we can now have a star festival......
Everyone is looking forward to it. <cf>I'm happy ...... if we can do it again this year. ......
I may not be here to stay ....... <cf>I hope everyone enjoys the Hoshirei Festival!
I hear a passionate voice coming from behind the door.
Yes, there - there!　I stand up straight and pinned! <cf> Hold still!　See, I won't lower my chin!
You're drawing back!　Smile, sm~il! <cf>Don't pull your arms!　Keep, keep!
You can't even ......, limit ......!
It's the people who think it's impossible who can't do it! <cf>Now then, let's move on to the vocal exercises!
Keep the posture as it is, and start with deep breathing!
This is ...... in this position!　No way! <cf> Absolutely, I can't ...... make a voice!
Oh, no~?　You've got a good voice now, don't you? <cf>If you're that energetic, you still have time to spare...
As expected of the reputed diva, Charlotte. <cf>It's worth training! Ummm, ummm, ummm... ......
Hiccup!　Ka, carvein!　Einlein! <cf>Please, help me!　Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
<cf> Show us the hidden mysteries of history today, my little metal plate!
Oh no, this is really amazing! <cf>The more I look into it, the more things come to light!
<cf>The more I look into it, the more things come to light! <cf>It's going to be a great research project!
<cf>The people who built their society older than the Buffalian civilization. <cf>The mysterious songs they left behind that are not handed down today: ......
This is a lie that needs to be unraveled! <cf>Come on, let's do it!
Mwah!　...... Oh, it's you!
No, I was just passing by. <cf>I was just passing by and saw it.
What does the chief priest of Lugerio want with that thing?
<cf>The chief priest is the one who unites those stone-headed priests. <cf>He has repeatedly interfered with my research.
<cf>Has he interfered with my research as well? <cf>Or are you going to blow my stuff up ......?
Oh, you~! <cf>There are some things you can do and some things you can't do,<cf> no matter how much you call yourself a chief priest!
I heard that you got to <cf>open the Star Spirit Festival in Asterlys for some reason.
I had heard that it was cancelled this year. <cf>We'll be able to do it, that's great news!
When people are in turmoil, it's a great relief to know that the festival will be held as usual.
The Principality is sending troops to guard the festival. <cf>The Hugo guy is supposed to be in charge.
<cf>Are we in some kind of trouble again? <cf> I'm sure I can be of some help to you guys.
<cf>I'm asking you to take care of the Star Festival. <cf>Get it over with and put people at ease.
<cf>I heard about the attack on the divas at the Star Festival. <cf>It sounds like it was a bigger story than we thought.
We are responsible for the hole in security. <cf>We owe you guys again. Sorry about that.
When Hugo comes back, I'm going to ask him about the details.
I don't think it's as important as Dunkirk. ...... <cf> I don't like the idea of someone messing with the Star Festival as well.
It's show time!<cf> Finally, it's the Stage for the divas!
<cf>The store is important, but you can't miss this one!
<cf>The shop is very prosperous thanks to your support, and the sales are record-breaking. <cf>I have to say a word of thanks to the gods of Buffalia.
I'll leave the store to the part-timers. <cf>To that guy I asked when I went to Canaroa.
Let's <cf>pray quietly in a solemn chant for today, at least.
Foo...... is still excited!
That was a great festival, the Seirei Matsuri! <cf>I've never seen such an amazing Stage!
The usual solemn chanting was good, but <cf>I guess the cult approves of such groovy songs too!
It changed my eyes a little. <cf>Wouldn't that make it easier for the young guys to go to the ritual?
I'm glad the Star Festival went well. <cf>Lugerio was ...... a little angry, but ......
I heard that Charlotte and her friends sang a fancy song on stage:......<cf>Really?
It's a place to thank God, <cf>I don't think that kind of thing is very good...... but......
......I kinda wish I could have listened to it.
Well, it's indeed a Hoshinreisai. <cf>It's so lively and nice!
If I didn't have to work, I would be giving myself up to a moment of <cf>relaxation</cf> accompanied by a beautiful woman.
Our soldiers are excellent, and we have guards from the Order. <cf>I think it will be all right if we leave it to the field.
There are also skilled adventurers like yourselves, aren't there?
Well, I will enjoy my visit. <cf>I will also see the Star Spirit Diva on stage.
With the addition of Miss Charlotte, this year's <cf>stage is going to be a highlight!
I'm looking forward to it now. Oh, I can't wait!
Oops, well, well, well. <cf>I wonder if you have also come to see the Star Spirit Festival?
I am one of the priests, you know. <cf>I should at least show up for the Star Festival.
Well, I wasn't invited.
But really, I didn't know that she was chosen to be the Diva of the Star Spirit. ......
Yes, a diva does not have to be a priestess. <cf> There are records that she was chosen by citizens.
But that thing is ....... <cf>She sang, well, she seemed to be pretty good at it.
No, I didn't come here to check on you! <cf>I just wondered if you've been neglecting your research. ......
......Mmmm. Well, that's for him to decide. <cf>If you're doing your duty, that's fine.
I will see the city as I see fit and return to my research. Bye.
<cf>With all the recent turmoil, I thought it was too late for the Hoshirei Festival.
It is a pleasure to welcome the Star Spirit Diva and to hold the <cf>Star Spirit Festival</cf>.
<cf>We thank the Gods of Buffalia. <cf>and to all of you for your efforts.
Thank you very much.
This diva's stage is a very special one. <cf>We, the priests, will be present as much as possible.
As many as possible, we must express our gratitude to God. <cf>For today, the theater is the center of Buffalianism.
<cf>Thank you, sir, for protecting our temple.
How could there be such <cf>unfreindly people who would attack the temple during the Star Festival? ......
It is truly deplorable. <cf>And we should be ashamed of ourselves for allowing it to happen.
We need to strengthen the security of our temples in the future. <cf>We must be more sure of our faith in God.
Oh dear. <cf>I thought we would be able to return home easily once the Star Festival was over.
<cf>With all the commotion, we can't just pull out the troops.
<cf>We're also looking into the infidel who attacked the diva and the temple.
However,<cf> I'm surprised that Miss Charlotte survived. <cf>You allowed the bandits to enter the back of the theater, didn't you?
<cf>Well, normally there's nothing we can do when they come up to our throats like that, is there?
It seems that you are a man of bad luck. ...... <cf>No, I'm talking about us.
I will let the Temple know if I learn anything. <cf>See you then.
As you can see, we are the guards sent <cf>from the Duchy of Barnhart.
We just had an incident like that happen. ...... <cf>We expected that there would be a strong wind against us.
The people of Asterlys and the people of the Buffarian Order are <cf>willing to help us with the Star Festival.
I'm ashamed of myself for being so anxious.
I know some of you may not be able to resolve your differences.
But this exchange is good for both of us. <cf>It is our responsibility to try to make it so.
Good right!　Left good!　All clear today!
I am a soldier of the venerable Principality of Barnhart! <cf> I won't let a suspicious man get away!
Mwah!　You think I'm suspicious? <cf> No wonder the people of Asterlys think so!
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you in the last incident. <cf>I can't apologize enough to the Order of Buffalia.
At the very least, <cf>we are sincerely determined to protect the Star Festival that you are all looking forward to!
Right, good!　Left OK! <cf>Mmmm!　We must also keep a close watch on the top and the bottom!
We are from the outer continent.
We heard there was a Star Festival. <cf>I thought it would be nice to take my grandchildren to see it.
There were all kinds of stalls, so <cf>we just got hungry!
Now, we could go to the theater, right? <cf>But where is it?
This city is too big, you know. The streets are so convoluted, <cf>I'm more lost than in the woods!
Wow, ni, I got talked to by a human ......!
You know, that ......! <cf>I'm not used to big cities. ......
Oh, grandma, I'm still scared!
The Seirei Festival is finally starting!
Well, I'm glad we could hold it again this year. <cf>After all, the Hoshirei Matsuri is something special.
<cf>When I hear the singing voice of the Star Spirit Diva, <cf>I feel so refreshed, you could say.
<cf>I'm on guard here, so it's a pity that I can't see the diva directly...<cf> Well, I can hear her voice through the door.
Well, I can hear her voice through the door. <cf>I will enjoy that.
The Star Spirit Diva will be here soon!
<cf>I'm looking forward to hearing what kind of singing voice she will bring to us!
Well, ...... the song was far beyond my imagination!
I'm talking about the Star Spirit Diva, of course. <cf>You don't expect a stage like that, do you?
I heard so many cheers, and I got as excited here as I did <cf>inside!
I couldn't help but open the door and take a peek. <cf>You'll have to submit your reflections later!
Hey, I did it!　I get it!
The guards are making their rounds all the way to the edge of the temple. <cf>They're surprisingly thin on the ground in the most conspicuous places!
<cf>They're trying to sneak in, and that's impossible! <cf>If you go in with the assumption that you will be found from the start, you will find ......
...... who the hell are you? <cf>No, no, when did you hear that?
No, that was ...... a joke, of course! <cf>I'm talking about the fact that you can't sneak into the temple, so don't!
Here!　<cf> You'll be suspected, too, if you stay in a place like this! <cf>I left early, I left!
Did you see the Star Festival?
My Charlotte!　Our Charlotte has performed the great role of <cf>Spring Diva of the Star Spirit</cf>!
<cf>I was so surprised! <cf>I hadn't even been told about it.
<cf>I would have flown in if you had told me. <cf>Totally ......
Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing well. <cf>It will be a foil for our next show, I hope!
No, but is it safe to invite a star-spirit diva to <cf>the troupe's performance?　Hmmm... ......
I heard. <cf>Charlotte has performed as the Star Spirit Diva?
I'm in awe that she has such a big role. <cf>I hope I didn't cause you guys any trouble.
Whatever the case, I'm glad to hear that she's doing well.
If she's a star spirit diva, her name will appear in all sorts of places. <cf>Maybe it will reach her real parents.
I hope it turns out for the better.
Well, well, the Hoshinrei Festival was a big deal.
I knew that Lalaforte likes cheerful songs, but <cf>I thought she would be quiet at the Star Festival.
I didn't see any ruffling of feathers last time either.
But ...... with Charlotte and Myrlene, <cf>the stage was lively and good!
The chief priest Lugerio looked bitter, but <cf>the people of the city liked it very much!
<cf>Traditions and customs should be respected. <cf>But not too rigidly.
<cf>I think it is the passage of time when new traditions are created in this way.
I wasn't the diva this time~♪
<cf>The Buffalian Order is so blind~~~<cf>They can't see my qualities....
I wonder if I won't be chosen because I'm talking like this~~<cf>I'm sorry if that's the case~~~ but it's fun to sing with everyone in the city.
But it's fun to sing with everyone in town~~~<cf>Bafaria~~~to our~~gods~~~!
The Star Festival is a solemn and prestigious celebration dedicated to the gods of Buffalia.
Do you understand?　It's definitely not some kind of frivolous festival.
The diva of the star spirit must also be accompanied by holiness and elegance.
<cf> You decorate your posters with such things! <cf> What do you think you are doing, praying to God? It is inexcusable!
The Seirei Matsuri is not a game. Muttsumuttsumuttsumuttsumuttsumuttsumuttsumuttsumuttsum ......
<cf>No running and no noise in the theater. <cf> Please be careful not to disturb others!
The gods of Buffalia are watching you, you know.
Don't panic, there is still time to start. <cf> Let us pray serenely with the divas!
It's almost time for the divas to take the stage. <cf>Well, I'm looking forward to it!
I've been waiting for this ever since I saw the poster for the Hoshinrei Matsuri.
This year's Hoshirei Matsuri is something different. <cf>It's going to be an awesome memory. I have a feeling about it!
Oh God, it's so late!
I left my husband in charge of the kids. <cf>I got there before you did.
<cf>I'll miss the diva if you don't hurry up! <cf>Totally, I don't know where you've been wandering around!
<cf>Master Carveen has captured one of the attackers of the Star Festival.
He is being interrogated in the basement of the Temple of Asterlys. <cf>Please be present, everyone.
I am finishing up the rest of the process. <cf>Please let me know if you need anything else.
I must <cf>write something down for the Order's reference <cf>about the recent Star Festival: ......
<cf>What do you think is the best way to describe that second song?
There has been so much commotion that I've lost track of it: ......
Isn't the biggest problem in the eyes of the congregation <cf> that a song like that was offered at the Star Festival?
No tradition, no prestige, nothing, <cf>just a flirtation like that ...... Oh, how lamentable!
This is no way to show the congregation. <cf>Totally, they have taken the liberty of doing this!
How many bones we have broken for the Star Festival. ......
[--]Excuse me. I have no right to blame you people. <cf>Please do not listen to what I just said!
Hah ....... It's all a headache: ......
Grizonia grass should be <cf>growing in clusters in several places in Cape Rawehara!
And in order to use it as a poison, it must be <cf>collected and primed immediately!
If there is a hiding place, <cf>it would probably be very close to the colony.
The local people would not go near it because they know that it is a dangerous poison.
I think it would be a good idea to <cf>examine the area around the Grizonia grass colony.
After Dunkirk, Yugoslavia is next: ......
No, not next, they were connected from the beginning. <cf>Maybe it was Hugo who was the mastermind.
I didn't see it coming, and I <cf>may have caused trouble for Charlotte and you guys. Sorry.
As for Hugo, he is still on <cf>inspection mission at Cape Lawehara.
He went to investigate the backcountry and disappeared. After a while, <cf>a report of death arrives from the area: ......
If a high ranking civilian officer dies after the head of the Order, <cf>everyone's upset will be uncontrollable.
And if he was involved in something wrong, it could shake the entire principality.
<cf>We'll wash the hands of those who have Hugo's breath in their veins. <cf>Leave this to me.
The excitement of the Star Festival seems to have calmed down. <cf>We're back to business as usual.
<cf>But it takes an ordinary businessman to relax here. <cf>The top of the top is not so easy!
We're holding the Seirei Matsuri☆Thanks campaign! <cf>We're going to start selling our new menu items in a big way!
<cf>Golden Chance to make a difference!
My Business Sense screams. <cf>This road leads to Coin Pavilion and my future!
Tirith...... how in the world......
Where have they gone this time? ...... <cf>I thought I had made it all the way here.
...... No, this is no time to be brokenhearted. <cf>Now it is up to me to bring Tirith back.
I don't <cf>feel</cf> as disturbed by the engrams here as I did when Shell chronolepted before.
Perhaps they just moved locations. <cf>Tillis will still remain in this time period.
Now we just have to find out where he is. <cf>I guess we'll just have to look around for him. ......
<cf>We will not give up, though. <cf>Please lend me your help too!
Tirith-san is ......[Mitsuka]igai is ......
If I had a firm boundary, ......
There is no oracle, no nothing. <cf>I ...... don't know what to do ......
I'm sorry......
That voice that called my name, was it really ......<cf>Mom?
The more I think about ...... my mother, the more I <cf>don't know!
She was a member of the Buffarian Gods, she had a history with Hugo, <cf>and now she's an avaricious shell. ......
What in the world happened to my mom?
And the master[--]Oh, the master Merlouf. <cf> I knew he was strong, but I didn't know he had such mysterious powers.
I don't know ...... too much about anything!
...... that's why I want to know. <cf>What should we face and do now?
Master. Let's find Mr. Tillis, let's find my mother. <cf>We shouldn't stand still!
Maybe I shouldn't be saying this, but <cf>Thank you for Hugo!
It was unbelievable and <cf>we couldn't have gotten through it without you!
So I just wanted to say <cf>thank you properly. <cf>Thank you so much.
I'm worried about you, Tillis. <cf>I need to find her and help her as soon as possible!
I may not be able to help much, but <cf>I can at least encourage Einlein and the others here!
And ...... let me think about it. <cf>What it means that I was born and met you.
I have received reports. <cf>I heard that an ambassador has disappeared from the "Seido of Heaven's Blessing".
As an organization, we will devote as many people as we can to <cf>searching</cf>.
However, there is also the matter of the attack on the Seirei Matsuri. <cf>We must also strengthen the security of the <cf>Sacred Temple of Heavenly Blessings</cf>.
We must not allow anything to happen to the oracle priestess, as it did to the Duchy of Barnhart.
I will inform you of the whereabouts of the [mitsuka] as soon as I know. <cf>Please wait for me.
His Majesty the Prince has changed his mood lately, hasn't he?
I <cf>heard</cf> that he hardly ever smiled when Dunkirk was around.
<cf> I hear that now he smiles openly more often.
It must be hard in the castle after an incident like that. <cf>He's a strong man who is carrying his country on his shoulders!
I heard that Hugo-sama is still missing.
He was involved in an incident or something. ...... <cf>The details are still unknown, but he is an indispensable man for the Principality.
<cf>I hope he's okay. <cf>I hope he's okay.
<cf>I'm having a hard time cleaning up after the Star Festival. <cf>I don't think the public will be allowed in the theater for a while.
<cf>But there are so many people who just want to see the entrance, it's like a tourist attraction!
<cf>These star divas must have gotten a good reputation!
Oh, grisonia grass? <cf>We don't deal in it.
It's a poisonous plant that's useful for hunting animals in the forest. <cf>I hear the forest people have been using it for a long time.
<cf> But in Jubilee, fishing is the main way to go. <cf>We can't just spray poison in the sea, can we?
I've never heard of a store selling it around here. <cf>I guess if you want it, you'll have to collect it yourself.
There seem to be several colonies of them. <cf>But be careful when you touch it, it's dangerous.
<cf>It is interesting that in Jubilia, the goods that customers are looking for are different from those in Asterlys.
<cf>Seasonings, sturdy clothes, and farm equipment sell well. <cf>Buffalian heritage is not so popular.
Jubilia is still in the process of development. <cf>It seems that too much wealth is too much to take.
<cf>It would be nice if trade were to flourish more, <cf>so that we could have an abundance of things.
I haven't seen any change in Tirith since then.
When Einlein sang, <cf> why did Tirith's consciousness come to the surface?
I also tried singing Tirith's favorite song, <cf>but unfortunately there was no change.
Ms. Eirinse, who worked here during the Star Festival, <cf>I heard she was only there for a limited time.
Oh, I wonder if I will ever see her smile <cf>again
I wonder how many <cf>adventurers were healed by that smile: ......
This is Jubilia. Welcome.
[This is a settlement on the edge of the Outer Continent. <cf> It's also a resort that can be easily accessed from Asterleaze.
What do you think?　The sea and sandy beaches are magnificent, aren't they? <cf> It has a different charm from the beaches of Asterleaze!
<cf> I love the atmosphere at night. <cf>The stars are full of stars and the sea is a beautiful reflection of them!
<cf> A glass of Dibon and you'll feel like you're in heaven!
Cottages and guesthouses line the streets. <cf>Wouldn't it be nice to walk along the seaside?
Jubilia will continue to grow and develop!
You are from the Magna Continent? <cf>Wow, you are very welcome!
The village of Jubilia is putting a lot of effort into tourism. <cf>We are still small and our other industries are weak.
But we are slowly increasing the number of local products. <cf>We sell traditional textiles from the region.
Another popular item is pearls. <cf>The processed goods are sent to Asterlys.
<cf>Please come and visit us and bring your friends!
Hmmm?　Are you guys looking for a throat remedy too?
I was asked by a forest woman not too long ago. <cf>I think I hurt my throat so bad that I lost my voice.
I wanted to help her, but <cf>I'm not sure what she needs.
<cf>I didn't know what she needed, and I didn't think we had it. <cf>I left disappointed.
Over there you can see Jubilia's famous "sea cottages"!
This is where everyone will be staying today. <cf>Please rest while being surrounded by the sound of the rippling waves!
Breakfast will be fresh seafood and fruits <cf>fill you up!
We hope you enjoy your trip to Jubilia!
......Good, it's almost time for the tour group to arrive. <cf>We'll guide you well, ooh!
Are you a tourist in appearance?
I have come from the forests of my homeland to do business!
<cf> I would like to ask the villagers here to teach me how to do it.
You may say that I am an eccentric among the people of the forest.
If you wish to tour the forest, be careful. <cf> For this is not a land that welcomes outsiders with open arms.
[There are subhumans called "forest people" who live in the outer continent.
They often come to Jubilia. <cf>Some of them even stay there.
They have been in contact with humans for a long time, and <cf>some of them even get together and become married couples.
<cf>But even when humans and forest people do get together, <cf>I think it's hard for families to live together.
They are always small in stature, and <cf>their children will probably have a hard time.
In that sense, Lalaforte is admirable. <cf>She worked hard to become a star spirit diva.
<cf>She has a special status in the Order of Buffalia. <cf>They say she's treated as well as a First Priestess.
I'm glad her hard work paid off.
Welcome!　Looking for some meat?
We have everything from Minsterhorn to Larpal to <cf>Barnhardt</cf>.
Of course, we also have Jubilia, but <cf>they're still working on it, it's just got a little bit of a smell that's stuck.
I like it, though. <cf>Customers can choose what they like.
I'll grill it next to you and you can eat it right away. <cf>Hanging out with skewers in hand is a fun way to see the sights!
Thanks every time! <cf>Jubilee style roast meat!
Don't be fooled into thinking it's just a skewer! <cf>They are very particular about the meat and the way it is roasted!
Especially the firewood. We go to great lengths to use <cf>wood from the depths of Cape Lawehala</cf>, which has a very appetizing aroma!
The appetizing aroma permeates the meat. <cf>They are best when sprinkled with local seaweed salt!
A cheap and tasty specialty of Jubilia! <cf>The meat can be bought next door. Here you go!
What's that?　I thought this place used to roast potatoes.
Jubilia's specialty is roasted potatoes on skewers. <cf>They were tasty, but a bit plain.
Maybe they didn't sell too many.
I think it's a good thing they switched to meat. <cf> I think this one will be more popular as a specialty.
We're getting some good fish from Asterlys and Canaroa. <cf>It's a bargain!
We can catch seafood in Jubilia, too. <cf>We don't get enough to sell.
It's mostly ornamental stuff, not much flesh,<cf> and a lot of it is poisonous.
Meat is more popular than fish. <cf>It's strange that a seaside village is so dependent on trade.
I am a boatman on a pleasure boat.
Well, in short, I just take the boat around the area<cf>!
<cf>We weave through the coral reefs and rocks. <cf>Surprisingly, it's very popular and well received!
Sometimes running into a monster is also a treat! <cf> Enjoy the thrill of the ride!
<cf> I'm just kidding. <cf> I'm just joking! <cf> I'm going through a safe place.
Hey, hey, did you hear about the priestess who can't speak?
A woman from Asterlys. <cf>She's looking for medicine.
<cf> She's looking for medicine, but the stuff she can get in Jubilia doesn't work. <cf>I feel sorry for her, she hasn't been able to speak for a long time.
<cf>Mr. Lalaforte, is it? <cf>The priestess with the bad throat.
It's tough, isn't it? <cf>A Buffalian priest's job is to sing, isn't it?
Is there anything I can do to help?
I moved here from Salamzat.
I knew the quality of the sunlight is different! <cf>It's still hot in both places.
<cf>The heat is the same in both places, but Salamzat is way over the limit.
It's refreshing to be so close to the ocean here and <cf> it doesn't get too cold at night!
Comfort itself! <cf> Hmmm, I'm glad I moved here!
<cf>It's almost time for the Star Spirit Festival in Asterlys!
The "Star Spirit Divas" will be leading the singing for the Buffalian Gods.
The people of the city will be singing and making a lot of noise<cf>and many people from Jubilee will be there.
<cf>Bafaria~~to our~God~~ I sing a lot in the taverns and squares...<cf>Bafaria~~to our~God~~...<cf>Bafaria~~to our God
More and more people are coming to live here.
In the past, there was just a lonely fishing village, not a place where trading ships would come.
It used to have an atmosphere similar to our forest, but <cf>now it's so busy it doesn't even resemble it.
Hmm?　Are you interested in the forest? <cf>Our homeland is much further into the interior.
It's called Koaniani Forest. <cf>It's an old forest where the forest people have lived since ancient times.
Here in Jubilia, there is no building that can be called a temple.
The Buffalo-Brazilian religion has taken root in the area for a long time, but <cf>there were not many people here.
It was all they could do to build an altar and worship there.
Recently, more and more people have moved from Asterlys, and <cf>we need to preach the Buffalo-Basilian teachings again.
<cf>I, too, was sent from Asterlys. <cf>I must fulfill my mission to the shame of God.
<cf>I hope to build a splendid temple here as well, if not better than the one in Asterleaze.
I have come all the way from my home country<cf> to escort Master Hugo. ......
<cf>As soon as I take my eyes off him for a moment, he's gone! <cf>And he is talking to women from one side to the other!
This is no escort, at all!
Oh, we're still searching again. <cf>Would you guys let me know if you find them too?
Poppoppo~♪ Nappoppo~♪
What's up, Poppo?　Is a talking Nappo rare?
<cf>If it were up to Nappo's cooed chisei, he wouldn't even be able to manipulate human speech!
[I'm not sure what that means, but I'm sure it means something. <cf>I'm not sure what he meant.
Nappo was originally from this continent, living near humans.
So they could speak the language normally.
But when they went to the Magna continent, they gradually became wild.
They stopped speaking, and some of them even turned purple<cf> and started to misbehave with humans.
<cf>Nowadays, I see bad nappos on this continent too. <cf>If you encounter one, you'd better be careful.
This is "Pupu House". <cf>This is a popular guesthouse in Jubilia.
Not only do human tourists live here, but also <cf>the people of the forest.
<cf>You can sometimes find forest people's food on the dining table. <cf>They like the fact that they can experience different cultures.
<cf>It's a home where everyone can feel at ease, without any boundaries between races. <cf>What do you think?　Pupu House is highly recommended!
<cf>There's a woman staying here, <cf>she doesn't look very well.
<cf>At first I was upset that she didn't even say hello. <cf>But she didn't really seem to have a voice.
I had a bad thought. <cf>I wonder if I could deliver you something, something medicinal.
Do you like heights! <cf>Do you feel romantic?
We are team Highlanders! <cf>We are a team of adventurers who continue to aim high!
<cf>We are a team of adventurers who are aiming high! <cf>Literally, we are seeking the high ground!
<cf>You have come all the way here, and you have the qualities to reach for the heights! <cf>Wouldn't you like to try to get to the top with us?
(That guy I was commissioned with......<cf> hasn't been heard from in a long time.)
(I thought he was good enough not to screw up, <cf>but he might not be back ...... anymore.)
Regular cleaning is important to maintain the quality of the water in Kirei Pond!
Schedule the next cleaning!
I've come to know ......<cf> that once my body turns another color, that's the last time I'll see it.
If my body turns purple, <cf>give me a break. ......
......
I'm in charge of the hot springs here!
I've been appointed <cf>manager</cf> by the queen!
Oh!　Adventurer! <cf>We, the Zilwet Troupe, are in full swing!
We have decided to make the Salamzaat Oasis our base of operations!
We are determined to give our diva, Charlotte, <cf>the best performance possible.
We will continue to strive to be the best traveling troupe of performers in Salamzert, and we look forward to your continued patronage!
We often go to [the outer continent] <cf> to preach the Buffalian religion there. ......
They have their own beliefs, <cf>so it's not always easy to spread the faith as we would like.
You didn't think the Seirei Festival was <cf>great</cf>, did you?
That was <cf>the best Seirei Matsuri I've ever seen!
I'm thinking of ...... if we can have another exciting Star Festival, and I'm asking if I can become a <cf>priest</cf> and be involved in the Star Festival!
I'm looking forward to the next Star Spirit Festival. <cf> I can't wait!
The dragon tribe is showing up again!　And near [SATO], too!
If only they could fly above us. ......
Anyway, could you please report this to JoOusama and <cf>propose that we strengthen our vigilance in the forest?
There's no reason to stop them if they've been baptized, <cf>you may go through with it.
The defeatists are causing a ruckus,<cf> so send the soldiers towards the pavilion!
Another defeatist group! <cf>This is a busy time ......!
[<cf>Leave the township to us. <cf>We'll make some noise to get the queens' attention.
<cf>To get to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits,"<cf>you need to pass through the "Tuonela Approach" ahead.
Go there first. <cf> Soon the guards will be thin.
Go on, then!　I'm counting on you!
The defeatists! <cf>Where did those guys go?
Father, ...... be careful with the guards, <cf> and don't get hurt!
(The lady said you could be <cf>friendly</cf> with this <cf> human being, didn't she?)
(The mother also said <cf>that this person would be all right</cf>.)
If you want to go to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits," go quickly. ......
The dragon tribe is ...... in ......
I'm sorry to have to take care of the dragon tribe.
The dragon tribe has left, but we must<cf>continue to be vigilant.
The dragon tribe is heading for the "ancestral spirit graveyard"!
Hurry!
No one without permission is allowed in this Ululau.
Especially if they are ...... human!
This is a story my grandfather told me from ......<cf>his grandfather.
Our ancestors took advantage of their geographical location and drove the Buffalian gods out into the outside world.
Grandfather,...... you never get tired of telling that story again,......
(According to the technology of the Buffalians in the legend, <cf>isn't that impossible? ......)
Didn't you say the other day that 'humans fought with them'?
The story about Ojiji is a lie Happi~~~!
What do you mean by 'geographical advantage'?
Well, I'm glad you're talking to me.
I, who am said to be an old woman who knows things, have an unusual legend to share with you.
From the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits", not only our ancestors, but also the ancestors of all the people who live on this continent were born.
And from that ancestor came the forest people, the dragon people, and the <cf>Baphalian Gods</cf>.
It's a <cf> lie, though, because they look so different. It's an interesting story, isn't it?
I've heard that dragon people have been seen a lot lately. ......<cf>Good luck with the security, have a safe trip!
You too, today is the day to pick berries, right?
Give thanks to the ancestral spirits and the blessings of the forest, <cf>and don't forget to cook the incense for the prayer!
(kumkum......)
Humans smell ...... something different, don't they?
(kumkum......<cf>I still feel at home with my own smell......)
Wow [wooooo]!
You're a baptized human[-]!
You're the one who was baptized in the woods.
Some years ago, there were baptized people living in <cf>[SATO], but they went back to Asterleaze.
But they went back to Asterlys.
They showed me many unusual things, and I thought <cf>the outside world is amazing!　I thought.
........................
I know in my head you're not like <cf> them.
I don't want to talk to humans.
Did you see those wholesale forest people in Jubilee?
That's my brother, <cf> he's a customer service guy, but he's so uptight. ......
I wish I could go, but I'm directionally challenged. <cf>I can't come back once I'm out of the woods, haha!
I used to sneak out of the <cf> woods to do business a while back.
But when the dragon tribe started showing up, my dealings were cut short.
Oh, and don't <cf>tell JoOusama that my brothers and I are secretly trading!　Hahaha!
I'm a human being ...... to ......
Didn't JoOusama say that you <cf>shouldn't</cf> have anything to do with ...... humans......
Oh,......I heard that if you get close to a human,......<cf>they'll take your tail!
Mother told us that. ......
There used to be a girl who liked to sing. <cf>She left her hometown.
She went to a place where people live. ......<cf>I wonder how she is doing now.
Do you see that beautiful, flowery tree?
That's where our ancestral spirits live, <cf>"Meiju".
When we die, we too will become ancestral spirits and go to the tree to watch over this place.
I will find for you all the good water in the world.
There is no better water in the world than the water of the Koaniani forest!
What's the latest fad?
What's the latest fad? <cf>All humans are alike, I have no idea!
Nappo is a nappo with a queen.
Have you ever offended the queen? <cf> When she's angry, she's as scary as an ogre.
Oh, yes!　I remember the last time I covered JoOusama with water and made her fall down.
She was scared then too, <cf>she was smiling, but her eyes weren't smiling!
(blubbering)
<cf>There is a legend that there are scary creatures in the forest. <cf>If you meet one, you will never wake up again and you will die.
That's why <cf>you must always go outside with an adult when you go outside.
Now, touch your ears and make a promise.
This is Ululau, where the forest people live.
It may seem unusual to humans,<cf> but we use very little of our Buffalian heritage here.
The trees of the forest are connected to the [Meiju] ......
The houses and furniture made from those trees are also <cf> a share of the tree of life.
We always feel the warmth of the tree.
......This branch and ......<cf>that branch look fine......
Listen, we have a mission to protect the forest. <cf>Make sure you take good care of it.
Up this hill is the Queen's mansion. <cf>Please do not be disrespectful.
<cf>Take care of the forest. <cf>I smell a history of warfare coming from you.
Have you seen it ......? <cf>I've seen those creepy creatures that roam the depths of the forest.
<cf>I've seen them, but I was so scared I ran away. <cf>Maybe you can do something about it. ......
Shhhh!
<cf>Don't talk to me, I'm listening to you!

Is it my imagination?
The sunlight on the beach and the sound of the waves <lf> are creating a pleasant harmony
I feel like I'm going to accidentally lie down. <lf>It looks pleasant ......
Here's a poster for a performance by a traveling troupe of comedians.
They were performing at Asterlys not too long ago. <lf>The diva's signature is written on it.
On the torn poster, a bludgeon has been scrawled.
'Hey, I ain't gonna let you get away with this!　Remember me!
The tree smells fresh, like an orange.
A sand-stained car is parked.
It's some kind of complicated device. <lf> The engram is reacting and emitting light.

How the heck does it work? <lf>I have no idea. ......
Engram streetlights lighting up the boulevard.
I'm getting thirsty.

For weapon modifications, "Martello Workshop" is the place to go! <lf>The most popular store in Asterlys!
<lf>Near the "Mawaru Rudder Wheel Pavilion"! <lf>How about a drink on the way home from a remodeling project?

There is a live announcement. <lf>"The enchanting storytelling girl, Myrlene, is here!

It smells a little fishy here ......<lf> There seems to be some raw garbage.
This load appears to have come from Asterlys.

'A resting place where laborers and travelers rest their bodies.
A thick tent blocks out the light and sound, giving us <lf>someday</lf> some peace and quiet.

'Do not ride Mount Imagine inside the store.'
There's writing on it that I've never seen before.
They say it's an ancient language of the desert people. <lf>The words are arranged in a certain rhythm, as if it were a song.
Somehow, I feel a sense of sadness coming through
A handmade scarecrow stands on the ground.
It has a rather charming appearance.
A net seems to shoot out from its body to catch animals. <lf>I'd better not touch it carelessly!
This is the village woodpile.
You'll need firewood to boil water, fire up the bread oven, etc. <lf>.

Chopping wood is an important part of the job
Vegetables grown in Minsterhorn are sold
The prices are reasonable. <lf>A good souvenir!
The names of Minsterhorn's past chiefs and their achievements are engraved on the wall.
The name of each of them is inscribed: "The adventurer Tarbetti and four of his companions pioneered the forest and built the <lf>windmill that marked the beginning of this place."
"Third Priest Jesús devoted his life to teaching the people of Buffalia.
"There were no takers, so he made Richard, a stray cat, head of the village, and the number of visitors increased dramatically.

"Goblins, mooks, ogres, and other subhumans live together in villages.
If you look hard enough, you may find their strongholds. <"If you look hard enough, you may find their strongholds, their strange tools, their strange cuisine.

There is a shadow flying beyond the sky. <lf> Is it a bird, or is it a dragon?
The wreckage of a destroyed machine lies there.
A number of parts inside are missing. <lf>It looks like someone has since taken them away.
Body hairs are caught in the ...... pried open outer panels. <lf>It belongs to a goblin.
Wreckage from the ruins of Buffalia.
It has a big hole in it and it's crumpled up. <lf>It looks as if it has been pierced by something thick and sharp.
If I had to guess, I'd say it was a giant tusk. ...... <lf>It's hard to believe it's human.
<lf>"Please take your garbage with you."
The map shows the surrounding area, the monsters that appear, the dangerous terrain, <lf>the distribution of flora and fauna, and other information.
It seems that they are <lf>especially</lf> wary of the ruins of the "Soundless City" ahead.

The cuts are messy and the aroma is awful. <lf>It's not very appetizing. ......
The tent is supported by chunky logs. <lf>I tried to push it, but it didn't budge.
It was built by goblins,<lf>but they seem to have the technology to do this.
The ruins of a Buffalian civilization, if you will.
It is a strange material, neither iron nor stone. <lf>There are scorch marks on the surface in places
I wonder if there was someone who broke these ruins. <lf> Or was there some event that caused it to be destroyed?
The sound of a whistle can be heard. <lf>It seems a liner has departed from Asterlys.
<lf>The ruins of Buffalia, like a decaying machine.
Completely covered with weeds after so many years.
An arrow pointing to Asterlys was painted on it. <lf> Apparently it's a signpost.
'Up ahead, Minsterhorn.'
<lf>"Twin Trees of Shooting Stars," as they say in Asterlys.
<lf> Whoever sees a star fall between the two trees <lf> will have his or her wish come true.
I heard that this area used to be a training ground for spell casters<lf>, but I wonder if there is a connection.
There is some kind of destroyed machine lying abandoned.
Old letters were left on a nearby rock face.
'There must be the ruins of Buffalia around here. <lf> Watch out."
A large tree has been felled.
<lf>It's impossible without a lot of power. <lf>Maybe there are large monsters here.
We'd better be careful.
If the streetlights don't come on, please contact the Pioneer Bureau.
Ahead, in the direction of the giant dragon's claw marks.
Dangerous Do not approach without reason
The names of the people involved in the construction of the bridge are inscribed.

The circular cobblestone pavement remains......

The muzzle of a cannon is pointing skyward. <lf>Maybe it was to prevent attacks from the sky?
A small defensive device? <lf>It is rusted and brittle.
It must have been subjected to a very great force. <lf>It is twisted in an unusual way.
There is a nameplate that reads, "Appartement Valrhine No. 1"<lf>.
<lf>The building is made from rock walls and looks very sturdy.
"For those of you who want a bigger floor plan!
"<lf>A maisonette type room for families <lf>available.
"For inquiries, <lf>go across the street to the Val Rhine No. 1 building!"

The writing is so badly blurred and blotched that <lf>I can't read it any more.
I don't know what will happen. <lf>I'm not going to touch it carelessly.
If you look closely, you can see gouged fingernail marks that look like <lf>blood has been wiped away.
There is a strange smell, like rotting flesh. <lf>I don't want to stay here for long......
Like there is something small and squirming around inside. <lf>I wonder if I'm paying too much attention: ......
Looks like a very old sword. <lf>It's inscribed with a crest I've never seen before.
To the tourists, 'Be careful of the tides on the beach! <lf>If you're not careful, it can be the cause of unexpected accidents.'

Advice for the exam
This is your first Adventurer rank-up battle. <lf>So, I have some advice for you.
Remember the Adventurer Registration Exam. <lf>I'm sure you made the right equipment to help you in battle.
First, weapons. <lf>Don't forget to equip yourself with the Adventures series.
Then the Enhanced Imagine. <lf>Are you equipped with the "E-Uri Uribo"?
Oh yeah, you should also use the Battle Imagine. <lf>"B-Goblin" or anything else for that matter.
Then, look around you and make good use of what you can <lf>use</lf>.
The <lf>Pioneering Bureau's examinations are not so lenient that you can easily get through them by force, you know?
<lf>Prepare well and go for the real thing. <lf>We'll be rooting for you. <lf>Good luck!
<lf>"Increasing fainting resistance" is an important point in this rank-up battle!
It is important to equip yourself with the appropriate enhancement Imagine and <lf>suppress the occurrence of "fainting"!
E- Asterize Far Away has a <lf> "Fainting Resistance Enhancement" effect.
Also, it is recommended to equip the second Enhance Imagine to increase your <lf> ability.
Any Enhance Imagine will do, but choose the one with the highest <lf> effect possible!
If you can, equip two Battle Imagines as well to <lf>make the battle go more smoothly</lf>.
Many adventurers stumble, especially due to fainting, so be sure to <lf>take every precaution possible</lf>!
This is where your adventures will be put to the test. <lf>Make full use of what you've got!
<lf>You need to be prepared for "paralysis" in this rank-up battle!
Just as in the previous Rank Up Battle, there is an enhanced Imagine that increases <lf> resistance to paralysis!
The "Paralysis Resistance Enhancement" is included in the <lf>"E-Flying Flying Flying Beetle".
You should equip this enhancement imajin before you challenge the <lf> rank-up battles!
If possible, I'd like to have enough Enhance Imagine to equip all five symbols <lf>!
And then don't forget the weapons. <lf>You should use the <lf>"God's Passage" series.
<lf>Be especially careful with the status quo. <lf>The monsters will get tougher from here on out, so get used to it!
<lf>"Earth Resistance" and "Poison Resistance" are the keys to this rank-up battle.
The first one is "E - The End of the Dry Wind". <lf>This has the effect of increasing resistance to earth.
And then there's "E - The Revealed Menace, The Long-awaited Roar". <lf>This one is needed for "Poison Resistance Upgrade".
If you have it, I also recommend <lf>"E - The Value of Handmade".
It is an effective Imagine, not only for <lf> rank-up battles, because it has the effect of "Damage Reduction".
As for weapons, I'd suggest the "Remnants of Silence" series. <lf>It might be tough if it doesn't have that much power.
First of all, <lf>control the damage you take well and don't fall down.
Then, you must attack to win the battle. <lf>You have to be aware of both in a balanced way.
This time, it's said to be one of the most difficult battles in the rank-up battles. <lf>Show me how good you are. I'm counting on you!
How's the adventure board going? <lf>I hope it's going well.
<lf>Try your hand at different adventures, not just raising your Adventurer rank!
The more you accomplish, the more rewards you will get, <lf>so I think you will enjoy it!
<lf>Whenever rank-up battles occur,<lf>please contact me again!
This time, it's important to counteract 'fatigue' in this test. Try equipping the <lf>'E- Sedentary Soldier M Mook' of the arrowhead.
Congratulations!　Your adventurer rank is now 10. You can challenge for a higher rank in <lf>"Rush Battle"!
Congratulations!　You have reached Adventurer Rank 11. <lf>You may be able to conquer even the most difficult adventures!
<lf>This time, the Rank Up Battle introduces the "Transportation Gimmick".
This gimmick allows you to move <lf>forward</lf> by carrying key items to a pedestal and manipulating them.
You will consume stamina while transporting, so <lf>always keep an eye on your stamina level</lf>.
When you run out of stamina, you will become "fatigued". <lf>Don't forget to increase your resistance to fatigue because there are also traps!
If you equip "M Mook, the E-Sober Soldier", you should be able to get the <lf>"Fatigue Resistance" effect.
Use weapons that are appropriate for your level.
Manage your stamina in battle as well. <lf>As an adventurer, I hope you have a broad perspective.
Congratulations!　Your Adventurer rank is now 12. <lf>Keep up the good work and keep adventuring in the wide world!
<lf>This time, the rank-up battle introduces a gimmick that causes a state of "restraint.
<lf>You'll literally be stuck in a bind, so you'll have to plan your countermeasures<lf> to get through it!
It is essential to equip <lf>Enhance Imagine</lf> with <lf>Anti-Bind</lf> ability.
E - The Surface of Lawehara is one of them, so <lf>create it first</lf> before going in for the test.
E - Dunkirk's Strike of the Demon will increase your resistance to <lf>fire and make the test easier.
Weapons should be from the series that can be made in the "Valley of the Coral Rocks". <lf>At least that's what I'm looking for.
<lf>Adapt to special situations with a cool head. <lf>That's what makes a good adventurer.
<lf>This test is all about "restraints". <lf>Don't forget about Miho's "The Surface of E-Lawehala"!
Congratulations, you have reached the highest Adventurer rank!　You have reached the highest Adventurer rank. <lf>You are now one of the top adventurers!
Here's where the best of the best join the fray! <lf>Good luck in the arena!
The arena is being prepared!　Come back later. <lf>I'm sure you'll have fun!
This one is still being prepared! <lf>Sorry!
I'm sorry. We're still preparing. <lf>Please wait a while for the opening!
Asterlys, would you like to go back to the "arena front"?

Interested in an Aegis fighter?
If you're so inclined, give me a shout. <cf>I'll show you how to fight an Aegis Fighter.
Interested in what I have to say? <cf> That would be an honor.
Let me introduce myself again. My name is Kohs. <cf>I've been an Aegis Fighter for quite a while there.
I use that experience to teach the younger guys <cf>how to fight as an Aegis Fighter</cf>.
By doing so, I hope <cf>that even one more person will become a reliable friend.
<cf>Since you're here, you might as well ask me a few questions. <cf>Even if it's something you already know, it should be worth reviewing.
However, it would be boring to just talk about it. <cf>Let's do it while we work on the request.
The request is to <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>kill the enemy. <cf>Let's go outside the city for now. We can talk about the rest there.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/> Let's go and defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>First, let's meet up outside the city.
Alright. Before we go to battle,<cf>let's do a quick review.
The Aegis fighter must<cf>care for one thing above all else. That is the handling of shields.
The shield is the symbol of the Aegis Fighter. <cf>It is also because of this shield that we can protect our allies.
We also have swords. Attack is important, of course. <cf>But we must not neglect defense.
When you fight the enemy, be aware not only of the offensive, but also of <cf>protecting yourself with your shield and defending yourself.
However, you will lose one day if you are on the defensive. <cf>While defending, look for opportunities to attack.
If you mix your skills in this situation, you will be able to fight more like an Aegis Fighter.
Okay, then. Then, let's actually try to fight. <cf>Let's start taking down the <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/> that you requested.
I'll go over there and take them down. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet up here. Call me again.
I want you to actually take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>. <cf> You'll need a balanced combination of attack and defense.
We'll meet back here when you're done.
Good job. You did a fine job. <cf>I didn't need to teach you anything.
How to use a shield and a sword. How to use your skills. <cf>I'm sure you'll be able to work smoothly with your companions.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> wasn't enough for you? <cf>Haha!　My bad if it was.
The most important thing for an ...... Aegis Fighter is to <cf>protect what needs to be protected!
That is what we must fight for. <cf>We must put our will to protect into our shields and wield our swords.
It's easy to say, but difficult to maintain that stance. <cf>But I'm sure you'll be fine.
You're a lot more ...... than I am.
I'm glad to have a friend I can count on. <cf>Good luck from here on out.
Thanks to you, I feel like I've gone back to the basics. <cf>I knew I shouldn't neglect the basics.
<cf>Next time, please fight with me. <cf>Let's try a more difficult request.
<cf>When you've honed your skills and gained confidence in your abilities, <cf>please call on me again.
<cf>I'll train properly too. <cf>Then don't forget me. See you soon.
Do you keep up your training?
Whenever I learn something new, I go back to the basics.
That's what's important.
How's your Aegis fighter training going?
When you get used to it, we'll fight together again. <cf> There's a lot more to learn from the two of you.
Will you take care of it? Thanks.
This time, I'm asking you to nominate an Aegis Fighter. <cf>Sometimes these things happen.
<cf>The request was to take down a monster in Minsterhorn. <cf>This in itself is not an unusual request.
<cf>But if you're dealing with belligerents, it's tricky when they come at you.
We want to be on the defensive just in case. <cf>That's when the Aegis fighters are called in.
They protect the people of Minsterhorn as well as the fields and farms. <cf>That's what they're asked to do with such expectations.
That's when the Aegis fighters show their skills.
First, let's go talk to them about what kind of monsters are out there<cf>.
<cf>It seems that monsters have been sighted mainly on farms. <cf>The client should be waiting for us there.
Then let's go to Minsterhorn.
Let's go to Minsterhorn to talk to them.
You are the Aegis fighter who came to us with a request. <cf>Thank you for coming.
No, of course. <cf>Can I get right to the point?
<cf>I hear that bad monsters have been appearing <cf>a lot lately</cf>. ......
Yes, I have. I have seen them too, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>hanging around the area!
Fortunately, our fields have not been damaged yet. <cf> However, they seem to be attacking livestock and people.
There have already been a few injuries. <cf>I'm worried that it will eventually come here ......
I see. Sure, maybe they <cf>have their sights set on this field next.
Are they after vegetables or ....... No, <cf>thinking about their behavior up to this point, they are still likely to attack people.
Some damage has already been done. <cf>The best thing to do is to take them down quickly.
Leave it to me. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Me and this guy can easily take them out.
If anyone else is a nuisance, though, we're in trouble.
Is it <cf> possible to have monsters other than <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>?
There are times when evil monsters suddenly appear. <cf>They come and go as they please. They come and go at any time and place.
I've met those monsters before at ......
......?　What's wrong? <cf>You sounded rather gloomy.
No, it's nothing. Sorry. <cf>Not that it's any of my business right now.
I'm going to go ahead and take the street and see what's going on. <cf>You can come after me too.
...... That Aegis fighter, <cf>he's a bit shady.
What, did you have a bitter memory? <cf>I may have said something bad.
Sorry. It was a bit of a blunt thing to say. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Thank you for your help in defeating him!
Mr. Coase has been <cf>examining the traces of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>!
He should be at the "Adventurers' Encampment," so <cf>I suggest that you join him.
You've come. I've checked the area a bit. <cf>No doubt, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>they left their footprints.
If we take them out in this area, <cf>we should be able to limit any further damage.
We don't want them anywhere near the village if we can help it. <cf>We want to control the battle line well.
Defense with shields is the key to the Aegis fighters. <cf>But if we keep on defending, we will run out of power one day.
<cf>You have to prevent your opponent's attacks, limit his movement, and then take advantage of the opening to attack.
You can be on the offensive while protecting something. <cf>That's what an Aegis fighter is all about.
......Yes, that's right. We fight while we defend.
Come on, let's protect Minsterhorn and the people! <cf>Let's split up.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>of each other's posts. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet up again around here.
<cf>Let's go kill the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>.
When you're done, meet us here. <cf>We will fight to defend Minsterhorn!
Good work. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>It looks like you kicked their asses!
It's okay on my end. <cf>Now they won't come near the village.
You are a good Aegis fighter, after all. <cf>I was able to protect what I needed to protect. I can count on you.
...... what? <cf>Do I look like I care about anything?
I just <cf>have a little memory of this thing called monsters attacking ...... villages.
With you, one day,......
[--]No. Sorry, it's nothing. <cf>Listen up.
If you ever ask me for help again, I'll be happy to help. <cf>I need to see you, Aegis Fighter.
That's a dazzling sight to me. <cf>Like a lost treasure somewhere. ......
So far, I haven't received any <cf>requests that would require your help.
But I will need your help in the near future. ......
I kinda have a feeling about that.
Hey, how are you doing?
Don't forget to review your equipment. <cf> For us, shields are a veritable lifeline.
Hey, how are you doing? <cf>You can help me with my request if you want.
It's to deliver <cf>"High Helm Beans" to a merchant in Larpal.
After that, he's got something else he wants me to do for him. <cf>I'm going to need some manpower.
I don't think it's going to be rough. ...... <cf> Either way, it'd be great to have you along.
I'll start with the "High Helm Beans". <cf>You can collect them at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in the Bahamar Plateau.
When you have collected the required number, go to Lalpar. <cf>Deliver them to the client merchant.
Let's collect <cf>"High Helm Beans" at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in the Baha Mar Plateau.
Are you the adventurer who accepted our request? <cf>You brought me "High Helm Beans"?
Yes, I did. <cf>I'm pretty sure that's what you asked for the first time.
I understand you have other business to attend to?
Yes, I do. I'm the one who collects and <cf>sells</cf> the foodstuffs around here.
There is something else I would like to stock up on, <cf>I would like to get some "akakara grass" which can be used as a spice: ......
Actually, there is a <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> on the street near where I want to collect it.
So, I <cf>requested</cf> a skilled adventurer to help us out.
I see. We need to collect "Akakara Grass" and kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>.
Can you please do that for me? <cf>I'd like to leave soon, if possible: ......
You mean in a hurry. <cf>Okay. We'll split up then.
Can I trust you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>? <cf>I'm going to gather some "akakara grass" while I'm at it.
The place where they appear is ...... "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>"? <cf>Towards the road to Litze.
In any case, we can't leave it alone. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>Take down the enemy, you're in good hands.
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>So take down <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>.
It's not someone you'll lose to, but be careful. <cf> I'll do the gathering of the "Akakara Grass" for you.
Oh, adventurers! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> You defeated him!
Oh. This guy did a great job. <cf>As you can see, we were also able to collect "akakara grass.
Well, thank you again and again. <cf>Thank you again.
As you can hear, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>is no longer out, so <cf>I think you'll be safe on your way home!
How about you?
This is the person who delivered the food from Litze. <cf>I was here a while ago.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> on the street, so <cf>I couldn't go home, and I was in trouble.
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks for that, I can go back to Litze.
You know, ....... <cf>You are Aegis fighters, right?
Yes, we are. <cf>We're both Aegis fighters.
Speaking of Aegis fighters, we used to be ....... <cf>That guy was an Aegis Fighter too......
...... Hey, you, do I know you from somewhere? <cf>I think I recognize him. ......
Huh?　Oh ......! <cf>No, I thought I was imagining it......
Um, sorry. <cf>I'll leave you to it.
Well, it's time for me to go, too. <cf>Thank you both so much!
From the time of Litze's youth ...... years, I'd say ....... <cf>...... No, no way.
When I was starting out, I fought a <cf>monster</cf> that attacked a settlement.
But I couldn't take that guy down. <cf>I was alone and inexperienced. ......
If I had had a friend like you then, <cf>the outcome might have been different.
That's why I'm glad I was able to work with you this time and <cf>help people.
If I ever need your help again, I'll be happy to help you. <cf>Keep up the good work.
Thanks for the other day. <cf>You've come a long way.
I wish I had a partner like you back then. ...... <cf>No, it's not worth mentioning. Forget it.
Looks like Ritze has a request for you.
...... I've been thinking about it a little bit. <cf>Should I take it or not......
It's a request from a resident of Ritze. <cf>I need your help again.
Apparently there have been some suspicious sightings around the village.
Not that anything has happened yet. <cf>But people in the village are getting worried.
Remember before ......, when I was a fledgling, <cf>remember I told you about the monster I missed?
That time, it was <cf>Ritze who was attacked by the monster!
They asked me to kill the monster and protect the village, and <cf>I couldn't do it. ......
I haven't been to Litze since then. <cf>I feel guilty and I don't know what to do about it......
But I can't keep saying that. <cf>There are people out there who need help like this.
You're the one who made me feel that way. <cf>With you, I should be able to protect Litze this time.
This is how I am, but I need your help.
First, let's go to Litze and talk about what's going on.
There have been some suspicious sightings around Litze.
Let's go talk to them first. <cf> Litze is a village in the Montenol valley.
Huh? <cf>You guys met before in Larpal: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>, the adventurer who defeated us. <cf>Thank you for that.
You are the young man who was delivering foodstuffs to the merchant. <cf>We just got a request.
We've heard that a suspicious person has been sighted in Litze.
You guys took the request.
What we saw was a suspicious man. <cf> He is walking around the village and looking into houses.
He is not a resident of the village. I don't know anyone, and <cf>I tried to talk to him, but he ran away.
but he comes back and wanders around the village. <cf>I'm not sure what they did to me. ......
That's definitely suspicious. <cf>Okay. Let's look for that guy first.
There must be other people who witnessed it. <cf>Let's talk to the villagers.
There's a suspicious man hanging around Ritze.
I'm sure there are others who saw him besides me. <cf>Let's hear what everyone has to say.
A suspicious man hanging around the village? <cf>Yeah, I saw him too.
I'm not one to judge people by their looks, but <cf>he's kind of a dark, shadowy guy.
I've seen him at different times of the day.
Morning, noon, night, it doesn't matter, he's always hanging around. <cf>My buddy said he saw him too, so I'm pretty sure.
Is there that much to see in this village?
I see. ...... <cf>It's not just travelers, is it?
You are walking around the village very carefully. <cf>It's as if he's checking out what's going on.
The man might be there. <cf>Let's look around the village some more.
The suspicious man has been spotted at various times.
Maybe he's still watching the village? <cf>I'd hate it if he was. ......
Hey, what? <cf>I'm not suspicious of anything ......
[--]!　You're a ...... coz! <cf>Aegis Fighter Caws?
You know me?
Yes, I know you well. ......
You're the one who ran away before the monster, <cf>What the hell do you want with Ritze now!
Thanks to you I lost my fields! <cf> Now you're sneaking around the village snooping around ......
It's your fault that I'm in this mess! <cf> Damn you, you abomination!
...... That man, probably one of the bandits.
He ran away towards the mountains. <cf>There is a gathering place for rogues over there.
He was probably checking out the village and looking for an opportunity to <cf>attack.
We'd better get a move on before they make their move.
We'll take out the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/> that appear in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>!
We'll make the first move before they attack the village. <cf>When we're done, we'll report back to our client, the young man.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Did you find out who that suspicious man is?
...... one of the bandits? <cf>That's why you were watching the village?
<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/> did you take them down? <cf> Then that's good. Thank you.
I didn't find that guy, but <cf> alone, there should be nothing more I can do.
Just ...... that guy, he knew me. <cf>It looks like he used to live in Litze.
He said he lost his farm because of me.
A Litze resident? <cf>That's why he said he lost his farm because of you......
...... I see! <cf>Anta, you were the Aegis fighter at that time!
<cf>You're the one who went to take down the monsters that attacked the village, <cf>and ran away!
<cf>You promised me that you would protect everyone,<cf> and you promised me that you would protect everyone,<cf> and you promised me that you would protect everyone,......!
Oh...!　I remember now. ...... <cf>You're that boy. ......
We were betrayed by you!
The village was razed to the ground, the houses and fields were ruined. <cf>Litse was almost destroyed that time, you know!
Caws. Are you still an adventurer? <cf>You couldn't protect us!
<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/>, that doesn't erase <cf>your past!
I'm sorry ....... <cf>I'm sorry I got you into this ......
Hey, can you accompany me to the outskirts of the village for a minute? <cf>Talking here is too public.
Hey, can you please accompany me to the outskirts of the village?
Talking here is too public. <cf>I'm sure there are others who know who I am.
This place used to be a field. <cf>It looks abandoned now.
This is the scar of what I've done. ......
When I was a fledgling adventurer, <cf>there was a monster that attacked Litze.
I took on the task of killing it, but ......<cf>I thought I was no match for it, so I ran away.
At that time, there was a child who promised to protect the village. <cf>That must be the young man.
I did not intend to lie about my promise. <cf>But as it turned out, I was a big liar: ......
And then I kept turning my back on Ritze.
I took this request because <cf>I knew I had to face the past.
But even now I don't know what I can do ......
I deserve to be resented. <cf>I don't know how to make amends for that.
But if something happens to Ritze, <cf>that's the time I'm going to try to clear my name.
Sorry for the heavy talk. <cf>I just thought you should know.
If I ever get a chance to make amends, <cf>I would be glad to have your help.
I'm gathering information on Ritze right now.
<cf>I will definitely try to make amends for the past.
If that happens, please lend me your help.
I think I'm getting a few more requests for the Montenol valley area.
I'm getting a bad feeling about it. ...... <cf>I hope it's just my imagination.
You're helping me out, thanks. <cf>There's nothing more reassuring than your help.
When I was starting out, I <cf> ran away from a monster that attacked Ritze, as I told you before.
It was an ogre called "The Flaming Hell".
We don't know what happened to him after he ravaged Litze. <cf>I never heard of him being seen or killed.
[Until the other day.
An ogre was spotted in the vicinity of Litze. <cf>The characteristics of the ogre are very similar to those of the "Flaming Hell".
He reappeared. <cf>...... I can't help but think so.
I've been regretting it for a long time. <cf>I must face my mistakes.
That's why I've been fighting<cf>as an Aegis fighter.
Let's hurry to Litze. <cf>We also need to find out who the ogre is.
If it's a "flaming hell," we'll defeat it this time. <cf>If not, I will protect Litze!
Come with me. Come with me, buddy!
Let's hurry to Litze. <cf>I need to hear more about the ogre that showed up.
If it's the "Flaming Hell", I will defeat it this time. <cf>If not, we must protect Litze!
Caws!　You're here again. <cf>What do you want this time?
We heard that an ogre like the "Flaming Hell" has appeared.
We're going to take it down. <cf> I'd like to hear the details.
Is it too late for that?　You ran away once.
<cf>We will not forgive your treachery, no matter what you did!
You can't apologize <cf>for running away from the "Flaming Hell" before,<cf> even if you were sorry......
Still,...... no, that's why! <cf>This time, I couldn't just stand by and watch!
This time, I will definitely defeat the "Flaming Hell". <cf>Please give me a chance!
......I think the ogre that appeared is the "Flaming Hell". <cf>Everybody says they are sure.
But I heard it was a size bigger than it used to be. <cf>I was a kid, so I don't remember for sure.
I got bigger ....... <cf>Does that mean they've grown up and gained more power?
Could be. <cf>Cause. You couldn't even stand up to the old "Flaming Hell".
And you still think you can defeat it? <cf> Are you really saying you can protect the village!
...... me and him, we can beat you.
We will protect Ritze. <cf>Trust the Aegis fighters!
......I don't even know the detailed places where the ogres come from. <cf>Ask someone else.
Believe it or not, <cf>you guys are the only ones we can count on right now.
Ok, I'll do that. Thanks.
Let's ask where the ogre appears. <cf>There must be someone out there who knows.
<cf>There must be someone somewhere in the village who knows where the Ogre appears.
You guys are the only ones we can count on. <cf>...... please!
Caws!　You, you're here again!
You are the bandit from the other day! <cf>You're the one who's still in Litze......
The bandits are out of business. <cf> You guys beat my guys to the punch.
I see. ...... <cf> Hey, did you live in this village?
Oh, yes, I did. I changed my physiognomy and <cf>nobody in the village recognized me, though.
That time ...... was after you ran away. <cf>"Flaming Hell" attacked the village.
Fields were razed, houses were destroyed,......<cf>and the village was a mess. My fields, too.
I couldn't live like that. <cf>I left the village and wandered from place to place......
I found myself in a bandit gang.
But that's all over thanks to you guys. <cf>Well, ...... maybe that was the only good thing about it.
I was trying to figure out what to do now, when I heard <cf>["]I saw a big ogre ["].
I thought maybe "Flaming Hell" had reappeared.
I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I came back to Litze. ......<cf>
I came here when I heard about it too. <cf>This time I'm going to defeat the "Flaming Hell".
I'm not the guy I was then. <cf>And now I have friends I can count on.
Leave the "Flaming Hell" to us.
......You're serious, aren't you? Cause.
The "Flaming Hell" is in the "Melissos River Basin". <cf>I saw the footprints. No doubt.
[--]Thanks.
Let's go. The Flaming Hell is a formidable foe. <cf> But we can't run away this time.
Fight with me! <cf>To protect Litse[--]!
The "Flaming Hell" is in the "Melissos River Basin.
They are going to attack Litze again. <cf>The rest is up to you, Aegis fighters.
There he is. ...... It's "Flaming Hell."
...... Damn, my hands are shaking at this stage. ......
I know, I know. <cf>I still can't shake off the illusion of the past.
<cf>I know that it's my own weakness of mind that makes the "Hell on Fire" look bigger than it needs to be.
But I cannot let the people of Litze get caught up in my own inadequacies again.
And I can't let you see any more <cf>embarrassment.
Now, let's go. The time to fight is now!
I am Aegis Fighter Cause! <cf>With friends I can entrust myself to, I'm coming!
......Yay! ......
We did it!　We defeated the "Flaming Hell"!
Ha ha ha ......!　You did it, thank you! <cf>Thanks to you for fighting with me!
<cf>Now the "Flaming Hell" will no longer attack our village. <cf>This time, protecting people has been fulfilled: ......
I don't know how to thank you enough for what you did for us.
Oh, I can't keep doing this. <cf>I'll go back to Litze and tell the young man.
["]It's all right now. <cf>The Aegis fighter made good on his promise.
<cf>I'll go back to Litze and tell that young man.
The "Flaming Hell" has been defeated. <cf>Litze is safe now.
<cf> You guys are okay!
<cf>You defeated the Flaming Hell. <cf>This time, really ......!
Yes, we beat it.
I know it doesn't <cf>write off the fact that you ran away in the past,......
Still, you kept your promise to me back then. <cf>I'm still glad. ......
I don't know, I'm starting to cry. ......
...... Oh, that's right. I heard you saw the <cf> bandit guy again who was hanging around the village before. ......
Yeah, I saw him. <cf>It's okay. He's not doing anything anymore.
I'll have to talk to the guy, too, <cf>to really settle the past.
Just hang out with me a little longer. <cf>Let's find that guy.
<cf>You finally made good on your promise to defeat the Flaming Hell.
<cf>Thank you. <cf>Please tell that bandit man.
Even that one looks like he used to live in this village.
Caws! <cf> You defeated "Flaming Hell"!
Ah. This guy helped us out.
I never thought an Aegis Fighter who ran away would come back to <cf>defeat</cf> the monster. ......
I kept <cf> Aegis Fighter for that very reason.
For one day, I would face my past and <cf>get over it.
I couldn't believe it on words alone,......<cf>but after all I've done, it's hard not to believe it!
That's quite an accomplishment, you guys!
What are you going to do now?
Well, ...... I guess I'll start over too. <cf>I'll plow the fields again.
See you later. Come back to this village. <cf>Aegis fighter!
Thank you. <cf>I was able to step out of my regrets
<cf>I'm going higher as an Aegis Fighter <cf>because you were with me.
It wasn't just Ritze you protected. <cf>You also protected my heart.
The desire to protect and fight for something......
That aspiration is the <cf>most necessary thing for an Aegis fighter.
I felt that strong desire from you.
I could feel it again, too. <cf>[--]Thanks again!
Hey, how are you doing? <cf>Do you see what you need to protect?
There are times when I want to fight with you again. <cf> You're the best partner I've ever had.
Are you interested in twin strikers?
Let's fight with other twin strikers who are also twin strikers. <cf>We'll learn how to fight together and we'll get stronger!
Yo, I'm Manuel. <cf>I'm the guy who will be the hero of Twin Striker!
...... still planning on it, though. Haha!
Ahim, the hero of Twin Striker!　You know? <cf> I want to be like that guy!
A legendary hero who turned a hopeless situation around <cf>with his overwhelming strength</cf> during a battle against the dragon tribe a long time ago!
We call him "The First Twin Striker"! <cf>Ka!　Amazing, isn't it?
According to this "Compendium of Heroes", <cf>Ahim the Hero was born in the place where Litze is now.
He was originally a lumberjack, but <cf>he threw himself into battle after the dragon tribe killed his wife and child.
Later, when he moved to the West Barnhardt peninsula, he fought so many battles that <cf>the king at that time referred to him as ......
...... is right!　I had asked him to do it!
Sorry!　I get so excited when people talk about Achim. <cf>My friends warn me about it a lot.
That's the friend who came down with a stomach ache. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>we were going to take down
We're both Twin Strikers. <cf>We wanted to have the same Twin Striker friends!
So, I'm looking forward to working with you! <cf>Anyway, let's get out of town first.
I'll be waiting for you out on the Asteria Plain. <cf>Call out to me, will you?　You shouldn't go alone!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>Let's go take them down!
I'll be waiting for you just outside the city. <cf>Don't go ahead of me alone, okay?
Hmmm... ....... I see.......... <cf>Right, left...... turn around...... and now up......
...... hmm?　Oh, it's you! <cf>We've been waiting for you. Are you ready for this?
I was just going over the Twin Striker manual for a little <cf>fighting</cf>.
According to the book, <cf>"The key to Twin Striker is to keep attacking!
'The more you attack, the sharper your axe becomes. <cf> Don't be afraid to take the first step and smash the blade!"
....... That's right. <cf> Indeed, close combat is the showcase of the twin striker!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>The total number of enemy names killed was six. <cf>Let's split up and take them down three at a time!
We'll meet up here when we're done. <cf>Okay!　Let's show them what we're made of!
<cf>Have you figured out how to fight the Twin Strikers? <cf>Then let's get to the real battle!
Let's go take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done!
Ouch. ....... <cf>Oh, it's you. You okay?
I'm sore. I was too focused on the attack. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>I got hit back!
I went back and read the textbooks and "The Hero's Compendium" and <cf>they got it right.
Not only to attack, but also to evade enemy attacks <cf>Twin Strikers need to ......
Ah, I was wrong! <cf>I wonder how long it will be before I'm a hero.
Oh, but you seem fine with it. <cf> Well. I guess those who can defend themselves can do it!
Good!　I'm not giving up after all! <cf>I'll definitely become a hero like Achim someday!
<cf>Next time, I'll try a more difficult request. <cf>You can fight with me, too!　Okay?
<cf>Not right now, but I'll get better at it. <cf>Once I'm stronger, I'll call on you again.
<cf>When you're stronger than you are now, give me a shout again. <cf>I'll keep practicing more and more!
I'm looking forward to the next commission! <cf>I'll be waiting for you!
Oh, that's you! <cf>I'm in training!
I want to be a hero! <cf>First, I need to get stronger!
Next time, I'll show you what I can do!
How's the Twin Striker training going?
Let's go back together! <cf> I had a lot of fun fighting you!
Yo, you're going with me on my request again. <cf>Thank you!
This time, I got the request from "The Roar of the Twin Axes".
You know?　<cf>Twin Strikers are a team of twin strikers who get together and cooperate with each other.
I've been getting a lot of help from my seniors, learning techniques, and being introduced to places where I can train.
<cf>I also get requests from the pioneering bureaus and so on. <cf>The <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>killing I took is one of them.
I decided to go with my friend for example. <cf> See, that guy who couldn't come before because of a stomach bug.
When I told him that you helped me instead, <cf>he got really excited.
[I was so excited when I told him about your help, and he said, <cf>I'd love to meet you if you're such a strong Twinstriker! [I'd love to meet you!
Sorry!　I may have <cf>exaggerated it a bit, like my favorite hero story!
But it's true, I'm buying your shit! <cf>It's nice to work with you again!
<cf>I've got my share ready for you. <cf>Let me brag about you to my friends!
<cf>See you at the Minsterhorn then. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> is supposed to be over there.
<cf><value type="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> is said to be over there. <cf>Each one of us prepares an item or something, and we meet there.
I'm going first. <cf>Call me when you're ready. See you later!
Let's go to the Minsterhorn. <cf>My friends are meeting me there too.
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>Sounds like you're ready to go.
But I don't think my friend is here yet. <cf>Has he got a stomach ache again?
Oh well. <cf>While we're waiting, I'll tell you the details of the request.
The target to be defeated is <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> that appears in the direction of "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon". <cf>It seems their numbers have been increasing lately.
I'm glad you've joined us, because it seems like we should be taking them down as much as possible.
I'm actually kind of looking forward to this request. <cf>I know it's inappropriate.
The legend of Achim, the hero I'm targeting, has a <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>defeat story in it!
The Twin Striker's manual also describes the episode and how to fight <cf>accordingly</cf>!
The Twin Striker's manual explains how to use the axe in the middle of a continuous attack, by assessing the number and position of the enemy.
<cf>A top-notch warrior is the one who attacks according to the situation, whether it is cleaving a group or aiming at an enemy in the air!
Wow, that's really cool! <cf>I'm going to fight like Achim the Hero!
...... But still, he's late. <cf>Waiting for the two of us is not an option.
<cf>Well, I'll wait a bit longer before I go. I'll wait a bit longer before I go. <cf>You go ahead and <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>start defeating them.
The <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> outside the Claws of the Giant Dragon are the targets. <cf>You don't have to go inside, just be careful.
I'm sure we'll be there soon too. <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done!
Let's <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>defeat them!
Go ahead and get started. <cf>When you're done, meet back here!
...... huh?
......Oh, you. Good night. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>You're done defeating them?
Yeah, I'm done with it. I finished mine, too.
<cf><cf>Oh, that hurt! <cf> Oh, that hurt!
<cf>Oh, that hurt! <cf>You have to jump right in front of the enemy and keep attacking!
So I guess that guy was in ...... pain too!
Actually, that guy ...... my friend came over. <cf> But he left without fighting.
I quit the ["]adventurer. I don't want to fight anymore because it hurts. <cf> He said he's quitting "The Roar of the Twin Axes" too and going back to the countryside ["]......
My friend and I have known each other since childhood, and we came out of the village together. <cf>The shock was too much for him.
We promised that we would both be great heroes. ......
According to ......'s "The Hero Compendium," <cf>Ahim the Hero saves his village from being attacked by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>.
At that moment, he fought alongside someone who would become a lifelong friend. <cf>...... we were going to be too.
You don't seem to be in that much pain. <cf> Maybe it's guys like you who will be heroes.
<cf>...... I'll be a hero, I'll be a hero.
No, you will be! <cf>A real hero wouldn't be down here!
<cf>A real hero wouldn't be down here!　That's what a hero looks like!
I'll show him too! <cf>I'll show him how a guy from the countryside becomes a real hero!
<cf>I'll master the way of the twin striker! <cf>I'll be a warrior as great as you!
I'm going to recreate the legend of Achim the Hero! <cf>Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　I'll do it!　I'll do it!　I'll do it!
My path as a twin striker <cf> starts here!
I'll have to give a full report to The Roar of the Twin Axe. <cf>I'm going back to Asterlys first!
Sorry for making you look so uncool! <cf>See you around as a fellow Twinstriker!
Thanks for the help! <cr>
I'm not quitting Twinstriker, okay? <cf>I'm going to practice harder and be a hero!
Let me fight with you again! <cf>Until then, all you can do is practice!
Yo, you're doing great!
<cf>When you get stronger, let's stick to weapons too. <cf>I know, I want to use a cool axe!
You know that big move Twin Striker has?
It's called the Vortex Impact. <cf>That's cool!
My hero Achim, <cf>of course, used to use it too!
But you know, ....... <cf>I can't use it yet, actually.
I'm practicing. <cf>I just can't seem to get it right. ......
But I want to be a hero! <cf>I want to use Achim's technique, which I adore!
<cf>I need your help to use "Vortex Impact"!
......What is it? <cf>You want me to learn about the technique first?
That's what I'm talking about!　You're smart!
<cf>I'll do some research then. <cf>Let's go to the bookshelf on the second floor of the Pioneer Bureau.
There are a lot of biographies of heroes there. <cf>Maybe we can find out about the techniques he used!
Let's go to the second floor of the Pioneer Bureau.
If it's the big bookshelf over there, <cf> there should be a lot of books about heroes!
I'm sure we can find something on this bookshelf. <cf>Let's look for the Twin Striker book!
Maybe there's something in there about <cf>The Vortex Impact</cf>!
Okay, there it is! <cf>It's a book about the legend of the hero Achim!
According to this one: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>, he crushed his enemy with <cf>"Vortex Impact"!
That's a hero Achim!　Strong!
But I don't see any description of the technique itself. <cf>Let's look for another book.
Now I found a book on Lothar, the hero!
Lothar was a hero who fought against the <cf>goblins</cf> all his life!
It is said that he recovered lands and property stolen by goblins and saved <cf>countless settlements</cf>!
<cf>He also had the integrity not to loot and kill for nothing, even against goblins!
That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about <cf>"Vortex Impact"!
Hmmm ......
It looks like Lothar could have used it, but <cf>I still don't see anything in there about how to use it.
Is there a book like a textbook on the technique?
...... Yes, there is! <cf>Let's ask our senior twin striker!
There's plenty of adventurers here, right? <cf>Let's ask someone downstairs to tell us!
Let's ask one of the senior adventurers downstairs.
<cf>There must be someone who can use "Vortex Impact"!
<cf>Would you like to learn how to use Vortex Impact?
Yes, I can!　I'm a twin striker, but <cf>I can't use it well yet: ......
Well, you're right: ....... <cf>I learned it from my own mentor.
It's not how to do it, it's when to do it effectively. <cf>You already know how to move your body, right?
When you're fighting, there's a moment when you're like, ["] here! [I'll have a <cf>bang</cf> when the moment comes.
And then it just comes naturally.
I was fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> and it came. <cf>Once you get it working, I guess you get used to it.
I see......... the moment it hits you. <cf>Thank you, senior!
Yeah, good luck. See you later.
I guess I <cf>know</cf> how the "Vortex Impact" works. ......
So, then, the rest is the <cf>bump moment</cf> that senpai was talking about.
By the way, didn't senpai say he was fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/><cf> with <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>?
That's what it said in Achim's book, ....... <cf>Maybe <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> is the key?
Ok, let's give it a try!
Let's go take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>. <cf>Me, of course, for the "Vortex Impact".
You fight it, too, and let me know what you feel. <cf>You might get some new hints.
I don't want to beat you too weak. ...... <cf>Okay, let's go to "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>"!
I'm sure we'll find someone responsive there. <cf>Let's first check out the garrison of the Order!
<cf>It seems that the best way to use "Vortex Impact" is to gain experience in actual battles!
<cf>Let's fight the Elder Goblins in the Andorra Basin. <cf>There seems to be someone who can handle them there.
<cf>Let's go to the garrison of the Buffalian cult for a start. <cf>From there, we'll try "Vortex Impact!
As I recall, there's a camp of goblins in the forests of the Andorra Basin.
I hear the Elder Goblins are <cf>hanging around there.
Some of them even come as far as Minsterhorn!
We've got "Vortex Impact" practice, but we can't just leave the <cf> monsters out there!
Okay, let's start taking down the Elder Goblins! <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done!
I decide!　Vortex Impact!
Let's split up and take out the Elder Goblins around here!
I'm going to practice "Vortex Impact". <cf>You can try it too if you like.
I'd appreciate it if you could give me a feel for it. <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done!
Yo, good job! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> You've taken down the enemy.
Of course, I've been taking them out, too!
Did you have a "Vortex Impact"? <cf>I guess so. ......
I think I had a feeling like that, not like that. ...... <cf> Hmmm, but it still didn't feel right.
And the technique didn't succeed after all, either.
...... Okay, I'll look into it again! <cf>I can't give up after all this!
<cf>"Vortex Impact" is absolutely necessary to be a hero!
What's missing, what's the difference between a hero and me ....... <cf>I feel like once I know that, I'll be able to use it!
Thanks for hanging out with me, man! <cf>Please do me a favor if you need anything else!
I definitely want to use "Vortex Impact"! <cf>I'm not giving up!
Anyway, practice! <cf>I'll do it to be a hero!
It's not going so well. <cf>"Vortex Impact" ......
Hmmm, maybe we should <cf>go somewhere for a change!
Yo! <cf>Do you use "Vortex Impact"?
I can't do it yet. <cf>I'm still missing something crucial.
So I've been thinking about it. <cf>I haven't actually done that one yet!
[--]Pilgrimage to the Holy Land!
Isn't that part of the Buffalian practice? <cf>The ones where you travel to places associated with a god!
In my case, I should follow in the footsteps of <cf> heroes like Achim!
If you get close to your heroes that way, <cf>'Vortex Impact' should work too!
...... Yeah, well. <cf>It's also true that I simply want to go there!
I'd really like to make a pilgrimage to the holy land of the hero Achim, but <cf>I'm from the Principality of Barnhardt, so that's a bit of a stretch.
So let's follow the local heroes. <cf>Let's go to Minsterhorn first!
That's the birthplace of Lothar, the <cf>hero</cf> who stepped on the "Giant Dragon's Clawprint"!
Let's go to Minsterhorn!
That's where the hero Lothar was born. <cf>There might be a clue hidden there to become a hero!
I've been to Minsterhorn many times, but <cf>it feels special to think of it as a pilgrimage to the sacred place of a hero!
This is the birthplace of our hero Lothar.
Lothar was an adventurer who took on <cf>The Claws of the Giant Dragon</cf> and formed a team called <cf>Dragon Crow</cf>.
That team was the first to step on <cf>The Claw Trail of the Giant Dragon</cf>!
<cf>Many adventurers are still trying to overcome the same challenge that Lothar and his team overcame!
It's called "The Road to the Dragon"!　That's cool!
Amazing, isn't it, heroes? <cf>Decades and centuries later, it's still a goal for people!
I want to leave a big footprint too, <cf>I want to be the kind of guy who gives courage to the future!
Well, let's see. <cf>If we want to follow in Lothar's footsteps, we can't miss <cf>The Claw Marks of the Giant Dragon</cf>.
It's where Lothar was most active. <cf>We can't miss it!
Let's go to the "Claw Marks of the Giant Dragon" next!
Let's go to the front of the Claw Marks of the Giant Dragon!
Don't go inside yet, okay? <cf>I want to feel the breath of Lothar the Hero from the outside first!
So this is the Clawmark of the Giant Dragon! <cf>Oh, just looking at it is amazing......
Heroes once stepped on it, and now future heroes are going to challenge it?
Cool, cool! <cf>I'd like to step on it by myself someday, too!
<cf>I'm still not good enough to go that deep. <cf>I still need the Vortex Impact!
The hero Lothar fought many monsters here.
<cf>The battle with the goblins is the most famous, but there are many other tales left behind.
<cf>The story of the Tyrant Boar's defeat is <cf>subtold in the songs of the bards.
I'd like to recreate the legend!
Let's go to <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/> and kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_00_03001"/>!
We're getting closer and closer to being heroes. <cf>Let's take our first steps as heroes!
When you're done, meet me at the entrance to "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon". <cf>Don't go home alone, okay?
Let's go to <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/> and kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_00_03001"/>!
Meet me at the entrance when you're done. <cf>Don't go home alone first, okay?
Ouch. ....... <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_00_03001"/> I got hit hard!
Oh, you finished taking them down too. <cf>As usual, you fought well.
I got hit and blown to bits.
I was trying to do a "Vortex Impact" and <cf>failed</cf>, and he ran into me.
Yeah. It didn't work this time either.
But I'm not giving up! <cf>Because it's my dream to be a hero!
Besides, I'm a little more confident now that I've made it to the "Claws of the Giant Dragon" and fought it.
So I think I'll try that next time!
It's the legend of <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/> defeating the hero Achim!
I didn't think I'd be able to beat him, but <cf>maybe I can!
I, <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>will try to find it! <cf>When we find it, let's go defeat it together!
Go for it, hero! <cf>I had fun this time!　Thank you!
The "Vortex Impact" ....... <cf>Why can't you use it on me? ......!
But I'm not giving up! <cf>I'm going to be a hero!
Watch me, <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>! <cf>I'm gonna take you down for sure!
I <cf>heard stories about seeing <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/> in strange places.
Usually they are inside the ruins. <cf>Why are you hanging around out there ......?
Yo! <cf>Will you listen to me for a second?
I told you I wanted to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>. <cf> Ahim the Hero had a legend like that.
So I found <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>!
But that <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>....... <cf>Something's not right.
Those guys are usually in the ruins of Buffalia. <cf>It seems like they're supposed to protect the ruins.
That's why they're not supposed to be wandering around out there.
But I found <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/> them hanging around in the <cf>Montenol Valley</cf>.
And he's getting a little closer to Litze!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/> is a classic enemy in heroic tales. <cf>He's strong, and no ordinary warrior can stand against him.
In a pinch, <cf>heroic Achim dash in and defeat him.
<cf>Ahim saving people like that is <cf>really cool, I just can't get enough of it!
But ...... I still can't <cf>use the Vortex Impact</cf>, I'm half a man!
...... honestly, it's scary. I <cf>want</cf> to run away.
But I can't. <cf>Because Litze is my home. ......
Please, come with me to Litze! <cf>And <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>help us defeat them!
I can't do it alone. <cf>With you, I can protect Litze!
Come with me to Litze! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>I need your help to defeat them!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>Are you ready to take them down?
...... you're calm. <cf>I'm ...... getting a little shaky.
I always wanted to be a hero. <cf>I've been emulating them since I was a kid.
Now I have the chance to be a hero right in front of me. <cf> And yet, I'm more scared than excited.
I think I know how my friends feel when they stopped being twin strikers and went back to <cf>the village: ......
It's such a scary, painful experience: ......
You, what do you think? <cf>Do you really think I can be a hero?
...... No, the answer is good. <cf>I know.
You have to make up your own mind, right?
Every hero has had his troubles. <cf>But in the end, they made up their own mind to fight!
So I'm determined too! <cf>......I'm gonna do it!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/> and defeat him! <cf>And protect the home I love!
Not to be a hero. <cf>I want to protect Litze more than anything else right now!
So I'm not going to run away, I'm going to fight.
He's in '<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>'. <cf> It's only a matter of time before he comes to our village.
Come on, let's go! <cf>We'll take down <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/> ourselves!
It's just up ahead, I can hear it. <cf>......<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/> is here!
Yes, now that I'm here, I'm getting nervous. <cf>Are we going to fight that guy now......
I'm still far from being a hero. <cf>I'm sure I won't be able to defeat him in a cool way.
[But so what!
Am I here to look cool?　No, I'm not! <cf>I came here to protect Ritze!
Even if it hurts, even if it's not cool, I'm going to fight! <cf>I'm not going to run away from you!
Please, you. <cf>If I get weak, you can kick my ass from behind.
Let's do this!　<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>! <cf>Your opponent is us!
<span size="Big">Yesssssss! </>
We beat you!　We beat you!　<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>!
It's not working anymore ....... I did it ...... seriously ......!
Haha look at ....... <cf>Me, my hands are still shaking......
I won. ......　Just like Achim, <cf>I beat the Quad Arm too......!
Thank you!　You made it happen! <cf>You gave me the power!
Now Ritze can relax. <cf>Ah, I'm seriously relieved!
Oh, sorry. You know, it's hard to relax if you keep <cf>talking here forever.
Let's go back to Litze. <cf>Hey, it's like a hero's triumphant return!
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/> shouldn't work anymore. <cf>Now Litze is safe!
Come on, let's get back to Litze! <cf>A hero's triumphant return, is that too much to say?　Hahaha!
Good job! <cf>Wow, that's quite an accomplishment!
Hehe ....... What a feeling, when I remember the battle. <cf> I'm starting to laugh.
Me, I was frantically swinging my axe anyway. <cf>I was swinging my axe so hard, I looked like I was going to cry.
There were a few times I really <cf>thought you were going to kick my ass!
Even at ....... <cf>That's how I fought, and I made it!
The "Vortex Impact" ......! <cf> Isn't that amazing?　It just came out by accident!
This means I'm a little closer to being a hero! <cf>I got a little closer to being a hero, didn't I?
Hahaha ......!　I did it!!! <cf>I killed that <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_00_02001"/>!
That's the first step to being a hero Manuel!
Me, I'm going to train again! <cf>To make that technique my own!
I'm going to learn how to use "Vortex Impact" and <cf>defend myself properly</cf> ......
I'm going to be <cf>as good a twin striker as you are!
Thank you! <cf>I was able to protect Litze because of you!
Thank you so much for saving my village and <cf>being my new target!
Yo, that's you! <cf> You're having a hell of an adventure today, aren't you?
I'm training again! <cf>The road to becoming a hero has just begun!
You're interested in the Blast Archer?
And I'm the one who's leaning in too far! <cf>Back off, I'll back off!
[--]You're here! <cf>I knew you would come to me!
Why did you think that, sir? <cf> If I had to guess, I'd say it's the ...... smell!
My sense of smell as a blast archer <cf>sniffed out your brilliant talent!
...... Oh, what?　Not funny?
'When it comes to making friends, it's important to make a complimentary first impression!' I <cf>heard you say that. ......
Oh, don't go home dumbfounded!　It's not! <cf>I really wanted a BlastArcher friend!
I'm still in training. <cf>I'm still training and honing my skills by taking on requests to defeat monsters and such.
But I feel lonely and uninspired when I'm alone. <cf>I was hoping to practice with someone.
<cf>I've been waiting for someone to be interested in Blast Archer for a long time, so I was so happy and excited!
So, you know?　<cf>we can teach each other what we know, <cf>work together to accomplish the same request, and so on.
Let's help each other like that! <cf>It will be fun and you will improve!　Right?
Let's go <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>defeat them for starters. <cf>We just received a request at the pioneer station!
Of course we'll pay you well. <cf>I'm not asking you to help me for free.
<cf>I can kill two birds with one stone, getting paid and practicing my bow! <cf>So, let's get out of town!
<cf>I'll get in trouble if I wave my bow around in the presence of people. <cf>I've had enough of that!
We'll start with <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>defeating them!
We'll meet outside the gates of Asterlys. <cf>Don't start alone, okay?
Now, now. We are now on the wide, wide Asteria Plain. <cf>You can shoot your bow as much as you like here!
The Blast Archer is a class that excels at long-range attacks. <cf>But that's not all!
<cf>The most important feature of the Blast Archer class is its versatility, as it can also obstruct enemy movement and provide support for allies.
Because there are so many things you can do,<cf>you have to watch your surroundings that much more closely!
But if you can master the Blast Archer's techniques, <cf>you can even take control of the battle!
The basic rule is to maintain a good distance from the enemy. <cf>Attacking from a distance is good!
Well, let's put aside the details<cf>Anyway, <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>and the actual battle!
You'll be fine. <cf>It's faster to try these things!
Then, let's split up and set out to defeat them!
Oh, and when you're done, please call out to us again!
Since we've come all this way together, <cf>you can't just leave on your own!
Let's <cf>defeat <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/> with <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Well, this is about as easy as it gets! <cf>Now, now, let's get rid of them quickly!
<cf>What shall we have for dinner today?
...... is that! <cf>Have you finished defeating them already!
Wow, that's amazing! <cf>I'm surprised that you finished so quickly!
Maybe you <cf>are</cf> more of a gem than I thought!
And <cf>how lucky I am to meet someone like that!
...... What?　Me? <cf>I'm not slacking off. I was just taking a break.
You can't leave until I'm done, and you're not getting paid ......?
Yes, yes, <span size="Big">I did! </>
I've been taking requests all by myself so <cf>I overlooked such a blindingly obvious thing!
Oh, wait a minute!　Wait a minute! <cf>I'll go finish it right away!
Oh, oh, oh, but..! <cf>Can we talk about the next request or something now!
I want to try a more difficult request next time! <cf>I wanted to ask you to come with me then, too!
Oh, it doesn't mean right now. <cf>I'll die if I don't get stronger. Ha-ha-ha.
<cf>I'm not trying to say you're weak! <cf>I'm sorry. ！！！！
And anyway!　<cf>I'm just saying that you need to grow up before taking on the next challenge!
I'm always where you see me! <cf>Please call on me again when you're stronger!
No, I still think I'm strong enough! <cf>Let's get stronger as a blast archer together!
That's a promise!　Absolutely! <cf>Then, um, I'm off!
It's fun to take on a request with someone!
I've been a Blast Archer for a long time now, and <cf>this was my first time!
Oh ...... I wonder if there will be a second time ......
How is your Blast Archer practice going?
If you want, we can practice together again. <cf>A little!　Just a little bit!
You can keep me company, can't you? <cf>Yay!　You are a good person after all!
You learn the bow fast and you have a good streak. <cf>I'm sure you'll be an awesome blast archer!
<cf>When you do, please introduce me as your best friend!　Eh?　No?
Well, well, whatever. <cf>Well, now that we've become friends, let's work together!
So, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I'm asking you to defeat them. <cf>I'd like to try something!
Do you know that a nut called "yami-bami" attracts <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>?
They say it has a unique scent, and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>used to be a tool to trap them!
You see, blast archers are <cf>primarily long-range attackers.
I thought it would be a good idea to lure <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> with "YAMIBAMI NO NARI" and target <cf>it from a distance!
What a nice idea! <cf>This would make it a lot easier to take them down!
First, let's go to the Minsterhorn and get ready. <cf>Yamibami nuts can be found over there!
Moreover, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> also appears in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>. <cf>It's all in the neighborhood. Lucky!
Well then, I'll meet you at the Minsterhorn. <cf>I'll be there first!
Oh my God, the way you just said that <span size="Big">that sounds like a great friend! </>
I've never met up with someone before!　I'm so happy!
I'll meet you at the Minsterhorn.
Oh, he said he's going to meet up with us! <cf>Sounds like a friend!　I've always wanted to say that!
I wonder if it's ready yet~♪ I'm fidgeting ....... <cf>I'm so nervous about meeting up with friends!
Oh, but will I be <cf>distracted</cf> if I've been waiting outside for a long time......?　I'll have to fake it!
...... is, wow! <cf>You, when did you... when did you... when did you get there?
You know what?　I just got here too!
.............................. ..................
<span size="Big">......</><value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/><span size="Big">Defeat! </>
Yes, we are talking about <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>defeating them!
That's why we're going to collect "yamibami nuts". <cf>Yes. That was our plan from the beginning.
Let's split up and look for them. <cf>We're sure we can gather them around here.
When you're done collecting, please come back here.
I'll do my best. <cf>Thank you then!
<cf>There should be "yamibami nuts" near the Minsterhorn.
Let's split up and go collect them. <cf>I'll do my best too!
Thank you for your hard work! <cf>Did you collect the "Yami Bami no Nuts"?
Oh, that's great. <cf>I've collected them too!
Well then, let's grind them up and put them on ......
...... is <span size="Big">stinky!　What is this! </>
It smells like meat that has been left out! <cf> Oh no!　It reminds me of something weird!
Ugh ...... so I wonder if <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> will come close to it. <cf>I've heard that monsters are sensitive to smell.
In the old days, hunters used various scents to<cf>deceive their prey or set traps for them.
...... Um, please don't casually turn your nose away. <cf>It hurts, doesn't it?
Hmmm, but will it work? <cf>I don't know right away.
Anyway, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> we have to defeat them. <cf>If they come in full of them, we'll have to deal with them.
Blast archers are supposed to keep their distance. <cf>However, there are times when you will be surrounded by enemies!
In such cases, don't panic, aim and attack. <cf>You can't break out of a situation by shooting blindly.
<cf>While attacking in succession, we must also check the battle situation. <cf>Please choose the best way to attack at that time!
Pfft.......... <cf>Are you surprised that I suddenly said something decent?
I didn't practice alone! <cf>How many times have I read manuals?
No, because I didn't have anyone to talk to. ...... <cf>Thanks to you, I know the manual by heart, word for word!
So, whether I can actually do it or not, <cf>I'm good at putting theories together anyway!
......You don't look at me with some kind of pity in your eyes, do you? <cf>Will it hurt you again?
Well, at any rate, it is practice! <cf>Because logic won't defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>!
I'll meet you here when you're done! <cf>Wow, I sounded like a friend again!
Now for the real deal! <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>!
Just follow the manual you memorized! Read it just one more time before <cf>....... Let's see. ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Thanks for your help in defeating them!
Hmmm ....... The "yamibami fruit" was not so good. <cf>It doesn't look like any <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> have gathered.
Be that as it may. <cf>Your skills are first class after all!
I would very much like to ask you to do something for me! <cf>Will you listen to me?
Actually, there is a prey I really want to hunt.
But it's very impossible for me to hunt it alone. ...... <cf>I was looking for a trustworthy and skilled companion!
Please keep this between us at ....... <cf>My brother got beat up by that guy ......
So I definitely want to hunt him down with my own hands!
If I join forces with you, <cf>someday, I'm sure we'll be able to hunt him!
Not necessarily right now. <cf>especially since I'm probably still out of practice.
But when the time comes, please do. <cf>Pick up a bow with me!
I know it's a selfish promise,...... but I believe in you,<cf> because, because,...... we are friends, right?
Awww ......!　<span size="Big">Yes, I said it......! </>
Um, um, I!　I'm going back to Asterlys! <cf>I'm usually at my usual place!
So ...... that ....... <cf>...... please give me a call again, okay?
Well, well, well!　Excuse me!
Well, thank you for your time! <cf>This is the end of the story of your friendship with me!
<cf>My story of friendship with you has come to an end! <cf>Our battle is just beginning!
<cf>One day our story will continue. <cf>Somehow, I have a hunch that it will!
Until that time comes, I'll be waiting just a little while. <cf>The day I can fight with you. I'm looking forward to it.
I picked up the "Yamibami no Nuts.
When I grow up to be a blast archer, <cf>I want to renew my weapons, don't I?
So, if you can, me and, you know! <cf>weapons to ...... matching ......!
and ...... I knew it! <cf>We're not ready for matching yet!
What do you think? <cf>How's your blast archer practice going?
I've been working a little harder too! <cf>I need to hone my skills to avenge my brother's death!
So, I have a challenge for you today.
I've got just the right request. <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>!
The people of Minsterhorn have asked us to help them with a large outbreak of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/> that is ravaging their fields.
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/> flies in the sky!
So it's a bit of a hassle to take them down. <cf>That's where we, the Blast Archers, come in!
The special feature of the Blast Archer is, of course, that it can attack <cf>at a distance</cf>!
Flying monsters are just that!
So I'd like to practice with you. <cf>So[--]anti-air combat!
Oh no!　<span size="Big">Cool! </>
Friendship-powered anti-aircraft combat!" What a <cf>word I'd like to say at least once in my life, wouldn't you?
......Hey?　Not really?
Anyway, let's go and defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>First, let's go to Minsterhorn!
Come on, let's <cf>speed up to that great sky with your hot and burning friendship with me!
Oh, my God!　Too nice! <cf>I wanted to say this at least once in my life!
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/> Let's go to <cf>Minsterhorn</cf> to defeat the <span size="B" size="B
<span size="Big">Air-to-air combat with friendship power! </>
Oh, God!　No matter how many times I say it, it feels good!
Hello!　<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>I'm <cf>Blast Archer here to defeat you!
<span size="Big">Two of us! </> We both came together!
Oh, we've been waiting for you. <cf>I can count on you two to come!
Oh, what are we going to do! <cf>We 'we', you said, are dependable!
After all, those who understand will understand, won't they? <cf>The power of our overflowing friendship!
Actually, <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>we also saw another flying monster!
It was a big, big Kagachiyanma.
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_00_01001"/>and he's a ferocious one. <cf>I was worried about him alone.
What ......?　<cf>Big ...... Kagachiyanma......!
Yes, it is. <cf>But the kagachi damselfly didn't do any damage.
I just saw it in the distance. <cf> Still, it was big enough to be recognizable, though.
Well, you'll just have to stay out of that one.
It's more <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>There's too many of them, and they're fluttering away. ......
...... hmm?　<cf>What's the matter, little girl? <cf>You look kind of difficult.
Don't tell me he's ......? <cf>...... Oh, no!　It's nothing!
We just have to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>, right? <cf> Leave it to me!
Please. <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/> seems to come from <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"
Let's go to "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" then. <cf>Since it seems to appear in a wide area, let's split up.
After we finish defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>let's meet up again here.
Let's take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>.
Let's not worry about the big Kagatiyanma for now ......<cf>
Thanks for your help! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_00_01001"/>It looks like you're done, taking down the enemy!
Well, that was a big help. <cf>As expected of an adventurer, you're very handy.
Even flying monsters are<cf>easily defeated.
Yes, sir. That is the true essence of the Blast Archer!
If we keep the numbers this low, <cf>I don't think they will ravage the fields!
Yes, you're right, we're good to go. <cf>Thank you very much. I guess that request is done.
I'm done with that ...... request, but <cf>can you hang out with me a little bit longer?
<value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_01001"/>In the middle of the defeat, <cf>I found something I'm interested in. ......
I also have something to tell you. <cf>I'll be waiting for you at the 'edge of the village'.
Please come to the edge of the village.
I have something to tell you. <cf>Go ahead, I'll be waiting for you.
<cf>I'm sorry for making you stop by. <cf>I'm really curious about something. ......
While we were in the middle of a fight, I examined the carcass of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E012_00_00_00_01001"/>!
When I did, I saw that it had been <cf>bitten off</cf> by something large!
Probably the work of the <cf>big kagachiyanma</cf> that my client witnessed.
No, it was exactly the work of ......<cf>"Sky Serpent".
Do you <cf>remember</cf> the story about my brother being killed by the monster?
It was my brother who taught me to bow.
He wasn't very good, and he wasn't very strong. <cf>He was my first teacher.
My brother told me that ["]hunting flying monsters is an important role of the <cf>blast archer["].
You may think this is an obvious statement, but <cf>it is very important!
<cf>This may sound obvious, but<cf>it's very important. <cf>Because that will lead to helping your friends.
But then my brother was killed. <cf>"Sky Serpent" took his life. ......
He survived, but the wound was so deep that<cf>my brother retired from Blast Archer.
I want to defeat the<cf>"Sky Serpent" to avenge my brother's death!
I've been chasing the Sky Serpent for a long time, and I finally found a clue!
I will find the Sky Serpent. <cf>Will you fight with me then?
I'm still inexperienced. ...... <cf>I need your help!
Sorry for the long story. <cf>Please remember me. Please!
The Sky Serpent, ....... <cf>The avenger of my brother's hurt: ......
I will find it! <cf>When I do, I hope you will fight with me!
<span size="Big">Avenge my brother! </>
...... is not about you! <cf>I mean "Sky Serpent"!
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!　I'm in a lot of trouble!
I found it! <cf>I finally found it!
What's that?　My brother's avenger! <cf>The Sky Serpent!
An adventurer from Litse said he saw him clearly!
Just the other day, he said it looked like he was using that area as a feeding ground for his prey.
We can't let this happen! <cf>We need to get to the Montenol Valley right away!
<cf>The Sky Serpent is a wanderer. <cf>The Sky Serpent may disappear again!
We will catch up with him before we lose him!
First, let's go to Litze and gather information! <cf>I'm going ahead of you, please follow me!
With your friendship with me, I won't let you escape! <cf>Wait for me, 'Sky Serpent'!
The Sky Serpent seems to be using the Montenol Valley as a <cf>feeding ground</cf>!
Let's go to Litze! <cf>To show them the power of our friendship!
Ah, adventurer. <cf> You know that girl Lili by any chance?
See, she's got that great energy. <cf>It's the girl with the funny sense of distance, the Blast Archer.
She ran into the mountains a while ago. <cf>She asked me to give you a message.
I found ["]The Sky Serpent! <cf>I'm going after it, so please follow me! ["]]
["]You'll come, won't you?　I'm sure of it! <cf>Please come after me for sure! ["]]
["]No, you know! <cf>I'd be happy if you did~......["]]
Hmm?　Where did I go?
That's what I'm talking about. ...... <cf>She ran off at once.
I didn't tell her where she was going.
But you know what? <cf> Just now, I heard a sound from the mountains.
Hmph!　That's the ...... thing. <cf> A sound like a hunter's arrow on a horseback.
I think it's not that far from the village. <cf>I think it's up on the cliffs to the east.
It should be somewhere in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>. <cf> Go look for him.
I heard the sound of <cf>[kaburaya] from the top of the cliff, east of the village.
I think it has something to do with a girl named Lili. <cf>Something dangerous, you should go look for her.
Wow!　You came, didn't you? <cf> Thank goodness!
You heard the [kaburaya] sound, didn't you? <cf>I knew you would get the message!
With the sound of a single arrow, you realized my crisis and <cf> even without words, you could guess my whereabouts. ......
<cf>This is the proof of a true friend who can communicate with you! <cf>I am so touched by your friendship!
...... What?　Usually the villagers tell me about you. ......
Oh, I didn't know that. ...... Hi!
Haha ....... But I made a doozy!
I saw the shadow of the "Sky Serpent" and <cf>I was just looking at the sky.
I didn't realize that <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/> had surrounded me <cf>before I knew it!
Blast archers are <cf>struggling if they get caught in between, so I had to be careful. ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/> and I lost <cf>"Sky Serpent" as I was running around.
I was indeed too tired to move. ......
Um, sorry for the inconvenience. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/> Could you take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/> for me?
I'll manage to get back to Litze in the meantime.
Sorry. <cf>I keep dragging my feet, but please do!
Please take down <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_02_01001"/> and then return to <cf>Litze.
I will return as soon as I have a chance. <cf>Sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
I don't know what would have happened <cf> if you hadn't come to me: ......
But I, I saw it with my own eyes! <cf>I saw the "Sky Serpent" with my own eyes!
I still want to defeat him. <cf>I definitely want to avenge my brother's death!
<cf>I still have a lot of things to work on, like practicing my bow and watching my surroundings.
I will never just give up!
This time I will be fully prepared, <cf>and I will look for the "Sky Serpent" again!
<cf>Thank you for your help this time! <cf>Next time, I'll show you my good side too!
The Sky Serpent: ....... <cf>Where the heck did he go?
I won't let you get away this time. ......
The last time I saw the "Sky Serpent" was when it was <cf>all the way away!
I wish there was a way to get closer to it for sure. ......
My brother's avenger, "Sky Serpent"! <cf>I found that guy's 'nest'!
I've only seen it from afar, but <cf>I'm sure I can get close to it if it's a nest!
But they are not stupid. <cf>If they know they are being targeted, they will move their nest.
If they escape from the Montenol Valley, <cf>we'll have to start looking for them all over again!
No matter what it takes, we have to take this chance to kill them!
[I always fail when I'm in a hurry!
First of all, let's prepare properly and <cf>get ourselves ready in Litze!
I'll see you later! <cf>I'll be in Litze, so please give me a call!
The Sky Serpent's nest is in <cf>Montenolle Valley
First, let's get ready in Litze. <cf>We'll talk more about it there. I'll go ahead of you!
We've been waiting for you! <cf>Now, let's take down the "Sky Serpent"!
<cf>I've heard that his nest is in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>.
I've actually seen the marks where he has eaten and scattered his food. <cf>I am certain that the "Sky Serpent" is there.
But, troublingly, it looks like there are cronies too!
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_01001"/> are swarming and <cf>taking up territory near the nest.
In order to defeat the "Sky Serpents,"<cf>we must eliminate their cronies first!
So let's proceed steadily, one step at a time.
First, we need to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Don't worry. If we split up, it won't be a problem.
The Sky Serpent will come after that. <cf>We've come this far, we're only one step away!
Let's do our best! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> and meet up here!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> and meet us here!
When you are done, meet up here. <cf>After that, it's time for the decisive battle!
Avenge your brother's ......! <cf>The defeat of the "Sky Serpent"!
Ah, welcome back. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_01001"/> You have defeated the enemy!
Sorry. <cf>I had a little trouble on my end.
Actually, <cf>"Sky Serpent" appeared while we were defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>!
It seemed to be after this girl who had wandered into the mountains. <cf>I rushed to protect her.
I'm sorry, sister! <cf>Doesn't your injury hurt?
<cf>You shouldn't go into the mountains alone. <cf>It's dangerous.
I'm fine!　I just twisted my leg a bit, and <cf>blast archers are strong!
Now, let's go back to your mother. <cf>Shall you ["]sorry["] properly?
Yes, I am! <cf>Thank you, Blast Archer's sister!
Well, I was surprised. <cf>But I'm glad she's okay!
Besides, you know, listen! <cf>It was only one shot, but I hit him!
In the head of the Sky Serpent!
He staggered a bit! <cf> He got away with the girl in his arms!
Not bad for me, don't you think? <cf>You think so, don't you?　I think so!
Well, the "Sky Serpent" got away <cf>as it were. Hahahaha!
Ha ha ...... ha ............
..................gush......... .........
I ...... me ...... me ......! <cf> Damn ............!
I was right there ...... right in front of you! <cf>That guy, the "Sky Serpent"!
And yet, it didn't work. ...... <cf>I can't believe I came this far and got hurt like this......!
I was so close to avenging my brother's ......! <cf>I...... feel sorry for myself......!
What ......?　It's not over yet......!
If you go after him now, you can avenge him....... <cf>But with my injured leg, I can't run away again......
...... with me, will you come with me?
<cf>Thanks ......! <cf>Thanks ......!
Yes, you're right! <cf>There's no time to be sorely tempted!
Let's go after "Sky Serpent"! <cf>We were originally trying to take him down!
He fled in the direction of <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>. <cf>I'm sure he went back to his nest.
His cronies <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> have been reduced and <cf>he must be frustrated because he missed some food!
Now is your chance. Let's go! <cf>This time, I'm going to lead him away!
Let's go after the Sky Serpent!
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" is where his nest is. <cf>I'm sure he's back there!
This time I will avenge my brother! <cf>Please lend me your help!
There he is: ......!　The Sky Serpent!
My brother ...... has finally come this far. <cf>Watch me!
I will do it. <cf>With this bow that my brother taught me!
I will avenge you, I promise!
<cf>Let's go! <cf>With you and me together, no enemy will scare us!
The Sky Serpent!　[--]I'm ready!
............Yay............?
What ...... is that?　Well, we ....... <cf>"Sky Serpent"......
Did you defeat ......?　Really ......?
Ya...... yay!!!！！！！
Ohhhhhh! <cf>Thank you!　Thank you so much!!!
<span size="Big">I'm so happy ......! </>
Gusn ......I'm so happy......!
Finally, finally ......! <cf>I was finally able to avenge my brother's death!
<cf>I wonder if I've become a little stronger. <cf>I guess I've become a little stronger now, to the point where I can say I'm a full-fledged Blast Archer!
Ehehe, thank you very much. <cf>I'm kind of embarrassed to say it myself.
Now, let's go back to Litze. <cf>I feel like I can walk around with my chest out now!
We were able to defeat the "Sky Serpent. <cf>It was thanks to you. Thank you very much!
Now, let's go back to Litze!
Hah~ You're back, aren't you?
You really did defeat it. ...... <cf>I still feel a bit like I'm in a dream!
Ah!　Blast archer sis!
Hey, hey, sisters. <cf>You killed an awesome monster, didn't you?
My hunter uncle told me. <cf>The monsters that ravage the mountains are gone!
So the blast archers are strong after all!
Haha, that's right. <cf> We killed the scary monsters!
A very strong blast archer here <cf>helped me out!
Wow, cool!
Wow, that's great! <cf>I want to be a blast archer too!
I'm glad to hear that! <cf>When you grow up, we'll have adventures together!
Yay!　That's a promise. <cf>I'll do my best in my studies and bow practice.
Please come visit me again in Litze. <cf>Bye bye, Mr. BlastArcher!
Phew, I just remembered something. <cf>I said the same thing to my brother...
I guess you are a nice <cf>blast archer</cf> in that boy's eyes, too!
That ....... <cf>Again, let me say this: ......
I'm getting so full of it. ...... <cf>But you've been fighting with me all along......
I, I ......!
<span size="Big">I love you! </>
Wow!　I said it!
But, but, but, it's the truth! <cf>I'm really happy!
Thank you so very, very much! <cf>I'm so glad I met you!
Please accept this. <cf>A reward for the commission [--] and as a memorial to us!
To my proud friend! <cf>The best blasting archer ever!
Ko, hello! <cf>Eh, ...... my friend!
And what's a friend! <cf> What am I talking about!
Um! <cf>...... will you accept my request, again, with me?
Hehehe ...... I promise, right?
Are you interested in spellcasters?
I need the help of a spellcaster. <cf>I would appreciate it if you could help me ......
I'm, uh, ...... Sailor. Sailor. <cf>Sorry. I just can't seem to get the name right off the top of my head.
I really need the spellcaster's help. <cf>Thanks for taking my request.
I'd like to ask you for a quick favor, if that's ok.
I need you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Do you know?　<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>
It is a monster that lives in the Asteria Plains. <cf>...... You don't think they're extinct already, do you?
...... they are still around?　That's good to know. <cf>No, I'm talking about here. Never mind.
Well, let's get on our way. <cf>I'll accompany you. Let's get out of town first.
I want to check out the Asteria Plain. <cf>As we leave the city, let me talk to you again.
I want you to go out to the Asteria Plains and defeat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>.
We'll talk about the details when we get out of Asterlys. <cf>Let's get there first.
Oh ......!　Nice view. <cf>It's impressive to be standing here on the Asteria Plains like this again.
Oh, no. That's not what I meant. ...... <cf>...... long time no see!　Yes, it's been a while. So it's impressive.
But more importantly, we're taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>I'm sure you're familiar with spellcasters too.
<cf>The key to a spellcaster's battle is the circulation of engrams. <cf>If you unleash your skills, you will lose your biological engrams.
If you run out of engram, you cannot fight satisfactorily. <cf>Hence the need to restore it from time to time.
Release the skill. Engrams are reduced. <cf>Recover and release the skill again, and so on.
This circle is the foundation and essence of spellcasters. <cf>Don't ever forget it!
If you defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>, you will get an engram. <cf>I want you to share some of that with me.
I'll take care of the preparations, <cf>you can defeat them as usual and come back to me.
I am gathering the materials needed in that area. <cf>Will you call on me again when you are done defeating them?
Sorry for asking you to go to so much trouble. <cf>Please do, I'd appreciate it.
Can you take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> at "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>"
The engram of <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> remains <cf>faintly</cf> in your body. I'd like you to share that with me.
Hey, welcome back. I see you've taken down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>.
Good, just as I thought. You have a <cf><cf> bio-engram clinging to your surroundings.
Now, I'll take some of this. ......
......There you go. Thank you. <cf>But you were a lot faster than I thought you would be.
It takes some time to master the spellcaster's skills,<cf> but you've got the spellcaster's gift.
You seem to have a gift for spellcasters. <cf>Maybe you can solve my problem.
Actually, I'm in a bit of a pickle. <cf>I have very little use for my skills right now.
Sorry ...... for the cause. I'm not at liberty to disclose it publicly. <cf>It's not something I'm guilty of. That's for sure.
I need help from someone I can count on to get me out of this situation. <cf>Could you please join me in collecting various engrams.
What I'm trying to do is somewhat peculiar. <cf>I still need a few more types of engrams.
Spellcasters are a class with a particularly strong <cf>connection to natural engrams.
By using their power to kill monsters, <cf>they can get the engrams I want for the first time!
That's why I wanted the spellcaster to help me. <cf>It's an unwanted fortune that I found you.
<cf>However, to obtain engrams involves danger. <cf>I can't ask you to do it unless you are reasonably competent.
I would be happy if you would visit me again <cf>after you have acquired some training and increased your strength.
I will wait as long as it takes for you to come to me. <cf>As a Sailor, it's the least I can do.
I will be in Asterlys, always in the same place. <cf>When the time comes, call on me again. <cf>Bye.
It's frustrating not being able to use your skills, isn't it? <cf>I envy you fighting out there.
However, there are things you can <cf>know</cf> just by looking at people in the city!
These days, adventurers are in a hurry, aren't they? <cf>It seems like there are more monsters, too.
Maybe this is<cf>a good time to gain experience as a spellcaster.
How about training as a spellcaster?
If you're available,<cf> I'd be happy to talk to you again.
You are indeed a kind man. <cf>I can't thank you enough for helping me out again.
If I could use my skills myself, <cf>I wouldn't have to bother you. ......
No, I don't see the point in speaking out of turn. <cf>What I should be saying now is my acknowledgment to you. Thank you.
<cf>I still need a variety of engrams to get myself back to normal as a sailor.
In this case, I need <cf>"nimrite ore" from the Asteria Plains.
It is a very fragile stone, easily broken, and of limited use. <cf>It's not easy to get in this town, so we've been having trouble.
And we also need <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> engrams. <cf> I'd like to ask you to take this one down later.
Same as the previous <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>After the defeat, let me collect the engrams that remain on your body.
These two things will help me, the Sailor, this time.
They are the key to getting out of the situation where you can't use your skills and can't <cf>leave the city to collect the engrams!
Of course, they are only part of a much-needed key, <cf>but they will not solve all my problems immediately!
I've heard that <cf>'nimrite ore' can sometimes be found around Minsterhorn.
I'm going to check the soil there. <cf>About that, I wonder if you could escort me.
Take me, the sailor, <cf>to Minsterhorn. I would be grateful for your help.
Can you escort me to Minsterhorn?
The soil found near there contains the engrams that I, <cf>Sailor</cf>, need.
Arrival. Thanks a lot. <cf>I wonder if we can examine the soil around here, out of sight.
I don't want to be too conspicuous. <cf>Now, let's see. ......
Hmmm ....... It certainly contains "nimrite ore". <cf>I'm pretty sure it's produced near here.
How do I know?
You see the engrams, not the soil itself. <cf>Sense, you might describe it.
Just like living organisms, inorganic materials such as ores also contain <cf>engrams
When you find yourself recovering your own biological engrams, <cf>is that possible?
Even if you do nothing, the <cf> engrams contained in the natural environment slowly permeate your body!
We can apply this to identify them from the engrams. <cf> Especially me, as a Sailor, I am very sensitive.
Oops, sorry. That was just a bit of trivia. <cf>It's a bad habit of mine to talk too long.
Let's get back to the main topic. Unfortunately, the <cf>engrams</cf> in the soil are still not enough.
We need the "nimrite ore" itself. <cf>Could you go and collect it?
I will set up the procedure for engram extraction. <cf>When you have the numbers, come back here.
Can you collect the "Nimrite Ore" for me?
It should be found in the "Minster Hills. <cf>I'm sure you can find it near the village.
Welcome back. <cf>You collected the "nimlite ore" for me.
Thanks for the help. The ones from other lands didn't work. <cf>It really required some subtle engram adjustments.
We still need more materials, and we have a long way to go. <cf>Will the day come when everything is ready?
We can't take too much time. <cf>If we don't do this, she will ......
......No, I don't blame you for feeling weak. <cf>We'll just have to move forward, step by step.
There is one more thing I would like to ask of you. <cf>Yes. The <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> engram.
As I said in my first request, I want you to defeat the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> and collect the engrams.
Those men are cunning and brutal. <cf>But they are not so much to be feared as they are to be fought.
Don't just attack blindly, but change your aim <cf> according to the situation.
Remain calm in the face of continuous attacks. <cf>You should be aware of how to use the engrams.
Oh, no. Another long story. <cf>I'm a Sailor, and I'll get to this in a minute.
It's okay. I believe in your power. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> and come back to me.
I need you to take down the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> that appears in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>.
Come back to me when you're done. <cf>I need to use the engram that clings to you.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>You seem to have had a successful defeat. <cf>Thank you. And I'm glad you're okay.
Now let's <cf>extract the bio-engrams that are clinging to you.
I've had you with me so far at ....... <cf>Let's talk more about my 'troubled state'.
Actually, I am not Sailor herself. <cf>I am the Imagine she invoked.
Somehow, I have <cf>been possessed</cf> by her body and cannot leave it!
Moreover, my consciousness is so overwhelming that <cf>Sailor</cf> can't even speak.
I didn't do it on purpose. <cf>I want to give my body back to Sailor.
I will perform a special ritual to do so. <cf>And that's why I'm collecting the necessary engrams.
It's not a story I can reveal to anyone, so I can't <cf>[lightly] ask people to help me.
<cf>Sailor is deeply appreciative of your cooperation. <cf>She can talk to me.
<cf>Sailor also wanted me to tell you the truth. <cf>["]Because I can trust you ["]," she said.
Sailor is also an excellent spellcaster. <cf>I wonder if there is something about you that draws me to you.
Anyway, that's the state of things. <cf>Me and Sailor both have engram disruption and can't use our skills.
So I think I'll be in your care down the road. <cf>Please, I beg you, good sir.
I am back in Asterlys again. <cf>If you see me, I'd be happy to talk to you.
Not to save me, Sailor, but to save Sailor herself. <cf>I need your help.
Your generosity is sincerely appreciated. <cf>This is all I, as Sailor, ask of you now.
I think it will be <cf>some time before you move the destiny of Sailor and me, Sailor.
Until then, I shall wait for the time to come, <cf>quietly, while I synthesize engrams.
I'm not bored. This city is much different than it was <cf>when I, the Sailor, was alive.
There's been a remarkable progress in the use of heritage and technology. <cf>I'm amazed that they have water and sewage systems in place.
I was so amazed that I used it so much that <cf>Sailor got mad at me!
I picked up a "Nimrite Ore".
You seem to be <cf>steadily growing as a spellcaster!
You should also pay attention to your weapons. <cf>You should use something appropriate to your abilities.
Hey, it's you. <cf>Thanks for all your help. <cf>Thank you.
<cf>I must go looking for engrams this time too, in order to return myself to Sera.
I need engram that can be extracted from a plant called Yogenka.
<cf>But, "Yogenka" is extremely rare. <cf>You can't even get it in Asterleys.
I was in trouble, but then I remembered ......<cf>that I had one thing in mind.
It was back when I, the Sailor, was still alive.
<cf>I had placed an offering of "Yogenka" on the grave marker of a great man.
I bottled the dried flowers, so <cf>with luck there will still be some left!
The amount of engrams required is negligible. <cf>If you can find even a tiny piece, that's fine.
But the destination is the Baha Mar Plateau.
As a Sailor with unsatisfactory skills, I <cf>cannot</cf> go there alone!
Besides, I need <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/> engrams. <cf>I still have to ask for your help.
First, let's go to Larpal. On the way, I want you to <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/>.
We are in Larpal, so let me know when you finish taking down the <cf>Horngoat.
Have you finished defeating <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/>?
When you're done, come on down to Lalpar. <cf>We'll go ahead, please.
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/> have been taken down?
Thank you. <cf> So, I'll take the engrams left on your body.
Now. The place we are going to is <cf>the place associated with Emmaline, the founder of the Spellcasters.
She was born in a small village in Barnhart territory.
When the village was attacked by a dragon tribe, she fought them off with fire and blizzard.
Emmeline's manipulation of the engrams was extremely [sophisticated], <cf>and she was said to be able to cause various natural phenomena at will.
[<cf> This is what spells are all about. <cf>This is the prototype of the spellcaster's skill.
Emmaline was the "first spellcaster. <cf>He is, of course, a bit of a legend.
After all, he lived in ancient times. <cf>The details of her character and accomplishments are unclear.
But it is true that <cf>she traveled the world, exploring things throughout her life.
In honor of that, <cf>spellcasters value inquisitiveness!
..........I'm getting off-topic!
I, as a sailor, visited <cf>What is the tombstone of Emmaline when I was alive!
She is laid to rest at the 'foot of the mountain of requital'. <cf>Take me, the Sailor, there.
Emmeline's tombstone is at the foot of the Mount of Calm. <cf>Take me there, my Sailor.
Oh, how I've missed it. ...... <cf>Emeline's tombstone is here.
Huh, you look like it's just a rock.
Exactly. This is just a rock. <cf>It doesn't have any say in the matter, nor is it a special place.
That's why it makes sense. ...... and it shouldn't. <cf>Let's get what we came for first.
......Oh, good. <cf>There's still a bottle left of my offering, my Sailor.
<cf>There is still some of the "Yogenka" left. <cf>Now I have the engrams needed for the ritual again.
Thank you. Again, thanks to you.
But in return, I <cf>have deprived you of one of your pleasures.
The search for the emerald gravestone is part of <cf>the spellcaster's quest.
Emmaline made this mere rock her tombstone.
He dared not leave a marker, but let <cf>the succeeding spellcasters find it!
The clues left in books, remains, and anecdotes <cf> can be used to find this place!
I'm sure some of the modern spellcasters are looking for <cf>Emeline's tombstone too.
So, could you please keep this a secret?
No worries. I'm sure you have other, <cf>larger 'quest' subjects.
Yes [--]a 'quest' so timeless that it will transcend time.
Now, I, the Sailor, shall return. <cf>I need to get on with the ritual preparations.
I need a few more engrams. <cf>Thank you again. Bye.
Sailor and I, being Sailor, <cf>are talking about a lot of things in our minds!
History, old friends, and ....... <cf>I wonder if your story comes up a lot these days.
Spellcasters pursue truth and facts, and <cf>the spirit of 'quest' to unravel mysteries.
Have you found a theme for your "quest"? <cf>I'm sure there's a great mystery waiting for you!
Hey there. It's me, the <cf>Imagine</cf> possessed by the spellcaster Sailor.
Oh dear. <cf>This name calling is getting more and more complicated.
If I don't give myself back to Sailor soon, <cf>I'm going to bite my tongue.
To protect my tongue, which is Sailor's, <cf>I shall find the engrams needed for the ritual.
This time, I, the Sailor, <cf>would like to collect the bio-engrams.
I found two tools that I used before I was born, you see.
But both of them are in a monster's den. <cf>I need your help.
One is a tent pillar in <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>"
...... You look strange, don't you? <cf>Of course, it's not just a pillar.
The one you're looking for is the cane I used before I was born.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Adventurers who have investigated the settlement of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>have told me about it. <cf>The pattern on the pillars was familiar.
They must have been used as materials for building tents.
As you can see, it's no longer usable as a weapon, but <cf>there must be a faint trace of my bio-engrams on it.
I need you to <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>kick them to the curb.
I will accompany you. <cf>I know I won't be able to help you in the fight.
While you are distracting the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>, I should at least be able to retrieve the engram from the staff.
Let's head to "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" for now. <cf>We'll do the detailed math on the way there.
<cf>I think the staff I was using is still at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>, though it has been made into a pillar in the tent of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. ...... <cf> I'd like to retrieve my engram from that staff.
Let's go to "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" for now. <cf>I will make detailed plans there. Thanks in advance.
Hmmm... ....... <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>"<cf>The city was known for being dotted with Buffalian ruins. ......
Compared to the time I knew it, there seem to be more monsters. <cf>In the past, adventurers and scholars used to frequent the area.
This makes exploring the ruins a bit of a challenge. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>They are walking around with their own faces. ......
......That's all right, I'm sorry. <cf>I'm so quick to get lost in thought when something catches my attention!
Let's focus on the cane used for the tent for now. <cf>It appears to be in the woods.
If you hide yourself in the trees, even I can get close enough. <cf>I need you to distract <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>they as much as possible.
Well, don't think too much about it, just take them down. <cf>I'll do my best.
If all goes well, we'll meet back here. <cf>So, let's get to work.
I want you to take out the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> guys around here. <cf>That way we'll get their attention.
In the meantime, I will sneak into the camp and retrieve the <cf>engrams.
By the time you are done defeating them, I should be able to come back. <cf>I'll meet up with you later at this place.
Thanks for your time. Thanks. <cf>You did a good job attracting the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>soldiers.
Thanks to you, I was able to retrieve the bio-engram from the wand.
How did my wand, a sailor, end up in the settlement of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>...... and you're probably wondering.
Wouldn't <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> and Mook also have <cf>engram manipulation like spellcasters?
Where did they develop their skills? <cf>And how did they inherit it?
Is there a class like Spellcaster ....... <cf> was my last minute 'quest' before I died!
That's why I visited the settlements of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>!
My own memories of that time are fuzzy. <cf>Perhaps I was killed by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>during my investigation.
That's probably why the cane was left behind.
Don't worry about it. <cf>That was hundreds of years ago.
Now. I wish the wand engram had been enough, but <cf> it doesn't seem to work that way.
I must find another one of my possessions.
Do you know a place called Berkmar? <cf>I lived in that area for a time.
There is no house left, but <cf>there must be at least a trace of it somewhere.
Let's go in the same vein. <cf>Let's go to "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" first and see what happens.
I hear that Berkmar is even more dangerous than here. <cf>I need your help once again.
<cf>There must be some remnants of the time when I lived in a place called Berkmahal.
I hear it is now a changed place. ...... <cf>You'll find at least a fragment of my bio-engram.
I'd like to recover that as well. <cf>First, let's go to "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" and see what happens.
[As the name "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" suggests, <cf>this used to be a quiet area.
Unbeknownst to me, there were more noisy monsters. <cf>No, I wonder if that's not the only influence?
I can feel the lingering scent of some kind of disastrous ...... strange atmosphere.
<cf>It is very possible that the monsters are becoming more ferocious<cf> because of the presence of the strange atmosphere.
It's a deep-seated problem. I have a feeling that it will <cf>affect</cf> your adventures and "quests" in no small way.
I'm curious about the truth of that too, but let's not get into that now. <cf>My errand as Sailor must be done first.
As usual, I want you to keep the monsters at bay while I retrieve the bio-engrams.
This time it will take longer than before. <cf>Maybe some of them will notice the engram's movement.
The <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> are especially sensitive to engram changes. <cf>It can be very troublesome if they mess with you.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> Can you help us to defeat them? <cf> Try to rampage as spectacularly as possible.
Let me hide in the shadows. <cf>When you're done, we'll each come back here.
<cf><value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>I want you to take down the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> that is nestled in the <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>.
I want an opening for me to retrieve my biological engram. <cf>After we take down some of them, they will go away.
When you're done, we'll each come back here.
Welcome back. <cf>All went well. Thanks to you.
Thank you very much. <cf>As a Sailor, that's enough of my bio-engrams.
[It reminds me a little bit of the old days.
I, a Sailor, was a spellcaster before I became a <cf>Imagine
My name is Slaft. <cf>I think I did some good for the people, but I don't know if you know ......
In any case, he died a long time ago. <cf>There's no way I could take the body of someone living in the present.
It's a distorted event, though <cf>not a desirable one, to be able to know the future world as an Imagine.
...... I think the next time I ask you to do something for me, <cf>I will be ready to let Sailor go.
Could I, the Sailor, leave you with anything?
In any case, next time is the last time. <cf>Please, please take care of me.
I, who am Sailor, and my real name is I, who am Slavt.
I guess I'm just one more step<cf> until I give this body back to Sailor.
We cannot afford to make a mistake. <cf> things must be carried out carefully ......
I, Sailor, am Slaft. <cf>Maybe it's time for me to stop calling myself this.
The time to return this body to the Sailor is imminent. ...... <cf>I have a feeling that's coming.
Hi. <cf>It looks like I'm finally going to be able to give myself back to Sela.
I mean,...... there is no more time to spare. <cf>You must hurry and erase me, the Sailor.
More often than not, Sailor does not answer my calls. <cf>She seems to be fading in and out of consciousness.
In addition, she is <cf>treating her skills more finely than before. An unwelcome sign.
So it is evidence that my will is <cf>acting<cf> more deeply on Sailor's body.
This will be the last time I ask a favor of you.
I will now perform the <cf> ritual to erase me, the Sailor.
The last engram I need is the one contained in the <cf>Maymar Mine.
I have looked for it in town, but it is not for sale. <cf>I guess because it's an ore that doesn't have any noticeable value or power.
I am the only one who needs such a thing. <cf> And it's only for a single ritual.
I want to hurry up and get ready for the ritual. <cf>In the meantime, I need you to collect the 'Maya Yar ore.
You can find it at "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>". <cf>When you're done, come back here.
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" I want you to collect the <cf>'Mayan Yar Mine'.
I will proceed with the ritual preparations here. <cf>You are so close to erasing me, the Sailor.
You brought me the "Mayanmar Ore". <cf>Thank you. Well, now it's time.
Sailor will be pleased. <cf>...... Sailor?　Sela?
I haven't heard back from you. ...... Not good. <cf>I'm losing consciousness.
We don't have time. Let's hurry.
The engrams you have collected so far have been <cf> crystallized and processed into a special mirror.
This must reflect my image. <cf>In other words, I need someone to hold it for me.
Someone who knows <cf>my situation as a Sailor, and whom I <cf>trust</cf>.
Come on, let's save the girl from the ghosts of her past, shall we?
It's too conspicuous here, and <cf>too many people will disrupt the flow of engrams.
There are better places for this ritual. <cf>Let's head for the Montenol Valley.
The "Melissos River Valley" would be fine. <cf>Please escort me, the Sailor.
<cf>The Melissos River Valley in the Montenol Valley. <cf>We can perform the ritual there.
It should be possible to save Sela. <cf>There is no more time. Let's hurry.
We've arrived. <cf>This is the right place to erase me, Sailor.
It's a long way to go, come to think of it.
Yes,...... there is a strong current of natural engrams. <cf>The conditions here are perfect.
I will be pushed out of Sera and <cf>dispersed into several engrams.
And will disappear into this stream. <cf>I imagine it's like scattering ashes in a river.
And when that happens I'll ...... maybe <cf> know the whole world!
That's a great moment to be a spell caster.
I thought ....... <cf>Sounds like there's a janky one at the end of the day.
Is this a bunch of ...... mook warriors? <cf> Their biological engrams are disrupting the flow.
They're a bad crowd in between. <cf>You don't have to hang out in a place like this.
<cf>If my engram doesn't flow cleanly, <cf>I could end up back in Sailor's body again.
There is no time to collect engrams from scratch again. <cf>I must succeed once and for sure.
[--]It is unavoidable. <cf>We will have no choice but to resort to force here.
Fortunately, <cf>I am also in a position to handle my skills, although not ......
Let's cooperate with each other and let the Mook Warriors <cf>disperse</cf>.
A swarm of Mook Warriors is interfering with the ritual. <cf> Let us defeat them ourselves.
There must be a corner of the "Melissos River Valley" where <cf>they hang out.
Considering Sera, we'd better hurry. <cf> Well, let's get going.
Looks like this is the place. <cf>They're gathering the footprints of the Mookwarriors.
Hmmm, the engrams are thick too. <cf>I'm going to have to dissipate this, or it's going to interfere with the ritual.
And ...... there's some loot lying around. <cf>A herd that has learned to attack people is dangerous.
Let's ask them to leave as soon as possible.
...... Oh, sorry. <cf>This is not the time, but I got sentimental.
I figured this is the last time I'll be fighting with you.
It's a strange fate, isn't it? <cf>I never thought the day would come when I would fight alongside a man hundreds of years my junior.
<cf>Seeing up close a talented spellcaster, <cf>I felt that the future was bright.
It would be an honor for someone like me to have had some part in the foundation of this age.
A trivial souvenir, but remember <cf>this "exposition" of the battle of Slught</cf>.
Let[--] begin!
[--]You're done. <cf>Yes, the flow of engrams is calming down.
That was a brilliant move. Thank you. <cf>Thanks for all the help you gave me.
Hmmm...... elation after the battle. <cf>I'm sorry to think that this is the last time I'm going to do this.
No, this is not the time to soak it in. <cf>I have to put Sailor first.
Let's go back to where we were. <cf>This time, the ceremony should go off without a hitch.
<cf>I'm going to be in your way for a little while longer. <cf>Please forgive me.
Do you remember where the ceremony is? <cf> Let's go back there.
This time nothing will interfere. <cf>We should be able to return this body to Sailor.
We have come this far for that very reason. <cf>We mustn't lose sight of our original purpose. <cf>Not for anything else.
You've come back. <cf>Now, I hope you won't tolerate any more trouble. ......
Climate and engrams are both fine. <cf>It looks like the monsters won't be bothering us.
I've got my gear together and I think I'm finally ready to go.
[Let's begin my elimination.
Take the mirror that I, the Sailor, made and <cf>stand in front of it. That's all you need to do.
Then I will release the engram. <cf>The mirror will reflect it and illuminate me, the Sailor.
Along the way, the materials you have gathered will act, <cf>converting them into a force that will push me out of the Sailor.
I'd like to explain in detail,[--]<cf>but there's not enough time for that.
The 'exposition's' slough, the last skill.
Is this the last time that I, the Sailor, will be known as ......? <cf>Thank you for sticking with me for so long.
You make a good spell caster. <cf> I hope you and Sailor will be friends for a long time.
It was a pleasure meeting you. <cf>Farewell. It was a pleasure[--].
......n............ uu......
Oh, can I talk......?　My body moves ......! <cf>Mr. Slaft!　Mr. Slaft!
...... you are really gone!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf> Um, could you let me talk to you at that place?
That place in Asterlys: ....... <cf>I was always standing, over there.
I used Mr. Slought's Imagine there.
Please let me tell you a story about Mr. Slaft at that place. <cf>It's a special place for me: ......
Please let me <cf> talk to you in Asterlys, in the place where I have always been.
Because it's a very special place for me and Mr. Slaft.
Awww ....... <cf>My feet are dizzy~!
Let's see, over there is the ocean. ...... <cf> haha, I'm finally getting used to moving my eyes!
I'm back, aren't I? ......
Once again. <cf>I'm Sailor, the spellcaster.
I have been watching you and listening to your voice for a long time. <cf>Thank you so much for all you have done for me!
I, here, used Mr. Slaft's Imagine and <cf>somehow we switched places!
And ever since then, Mr. Slaft and I <cf>have been talking about a lot of things!
I had half given up, but <cf>Mr. Slaft always apologized to me!
And he was always encouraging me.
I'm glad we're back together. <cf>But I miss Mr. Slaft. ......
I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye properly. ......
...... Huh?　In your pocket...... Oh!
This is Mr. Slaft's Imagine Seed......!
I see....... You stayed behind. ......
Adventurer. I will try to find a way to <cf>correctly call Mr. Slaft again!
I have never had a <cf>'quest' theme as a spellcaster!
But you and Mr. Slaft have <cf>given me that!
You'll see. <cf>I will be a great spell caster!
I'll work as hard on my <cf>skill training and "exploration" as you do!
Hello! <cf>This is me, Sailor, a spellcaster!
Imagine, there is so much to think about. <cf>I need to learn more and more!
Maybe I should visit the Imagine Institute. <cf>I know it's strange, but they say they have some excellent people. ......
Oh, you're interested in the Heavy Smasher?
I can't get enough of the weight of a blow. <cf>You too can get a kick out of it if you let loose with a bang!
Yo!　You've become a heavy smasher. <cf>And you've got another friend. Welcome to the club!
I'm Maschietta. Nice to meet you!
I used to be with my master until recently. <cf>Now I'm all alone.
[<cf>I got my ass kicked.
Well, I guess that's a little bit of recognition!
But I felt like I was missing something. <cf>I wanted a fellow heavy smasher.
If it's okay with you, let's work together to get the job done!
<cf>I'd better get used to handling weapons first. <cf>It's very unique and unusual, isn't it?
I'll take care of it. <cf>I'll teach you how to do it!
I just got a request for <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/>defeat. <cf>Wouldn't that be just great?　Come on, let's do it together.
I'll be waiting outside the gate. <cf>Come when you're ready!
You're a heavy smasher, you'll have to get used to the weapon. <cf>Let's take down <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/> at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>.
I'll be waiting for you outside the gates of Asterlys. <cf>Come quickly, won't you?
Okay, you're here. <cf>Now for a quick explanation.
The heavy smasher fights with this ball. <cf>It's a little heavy, but that's why it's specialized for one blow.
<cf>The power of the engram in the cartridge makes the ball on the tip of this ball shoot out with a bang!　and it pops out!
And then <span size="Big">boom</span>, it hits the opponent! </> and hit him with <span size="Big">Boom!
And then, the ball comes back and is aimed at the opponent again ....... <cf>This is how a heavy smasher fights!
You think I don't understand it even if you explain it to me?
Hahahaha!　I understand! <cf>I'm the type of person who learns by heart.
<cf>I don't have to think too hard about it. <cf>All you have to do is hit the ball!
<cf> They say it's better to get used to it than to learn it. <cf>Let's actually try smashing some monsters!
<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/> and we're asked to kill them. <cf>I'll learn on my own after I kill a few of them.
I'm going to go over there and bust some ass. <cf>When you're done, meet me here.
All right!　Let's get this over with!
We'll take down the <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Meet me here when you're done. <cf>Don't worry, we'll pay you your share, okay?
Oh, you've already killed <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>You're pretty reasonable!
How's that?　You must feel good! <cf>I'm sweating good too, I feel good!
<cf>That's the romance of putting a bang on a single blow! <cf>This is the charm of the heavy smasher!
<cf>If you train hard enough, even a big one like an ogre won't be able to beat you!
I had a good time today! <cf>Thank you for helping me with my request.
Let's go out again together next time!
<cf>It's nice to have a fellow heavy smasher!
It's better to smash with two people than one!
How's your heavy smasher training going? <cf>Are you getting stronger?
Next time <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>I'd love to <cf>smash something more challenging!
Hey, how are you doing?
I need some help with my work today.
Actually, my mentor told me to. <cf>[[You should also learn to cooperate with your friends[]].
My master and I were so far apart in our abilities that we didn't feel like <cf>companions</cf>. ......
I think I can <cf>feel</cf> like I'm a friend who can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you!
I'm sure we'll be fighting <cf>together</cf> with other heavy smashers from now on, won't we?
I just want to get a feel for it while I can.
The request is to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>A farmhouse in Minsterhorn was attacked by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>.
The full story will be explained there. <cf>For now, let's meet up in Minsterhorn!
Okay, let's go <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>to take it down. <cf>Meet us at Minsterhorn!
Hey, you're here. <cf>I heard about you first.
A farmer's wife was trying to sell vegetables when <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>they attacked her.
She wasn't hurt, but she <cf>left her vegetables behind</cf> to escape.
The old lady was very depressed. That's unforgivable. ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>I'm not satisfied with just defeating them and that's it!
I learned it from my mentor. <cf>["]Adventurers should make their clients smile.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>, but that doesn't make Obasan smile. <cf>I gotta get my precious vegetables back!
There should be some vegetables down near Minsterhorn. <cf>Let's go get them first.
I'll go with you, let me know when you're done. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> will pay you back handsomely afterwards!
There should be a crate of <cf>vegetables down near Minsterhorn.
Let's get that one first. Let me know <cf>when you're done. Then <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>defeat them!
Whew. <cf>I hope you found all the vegetables now.
Thanks. <cf>Well, I guess I'll have to punish <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> then!
I was thinking ......, but me and you guys are going our separate ways.
I just delivered some vegetables I found, and <cf>the old lady was thrilled.
[I was afraid to say so, but <cf> I actually left her some fruit too. ......["]!
You should have told me from the beginning...!
So I'm going to go look for some fruit. <cf>You take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>.
In a way, it might be <cf>just right</cf> for the role of the heavysmasher.
You know, the attack of the heavysmasher. <cf>It doesn't just buzz the monster.
It's a weighted blow that can limit their movement and <cf>slow them down.
That's how you restrict and attract the enemy's movement. That's how <cf>heavy smashers fight.
So while you <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>attract the enemy, <cf>I'm going to retrieve the fruit.
How's that? <cf>That's what we call "[working together]", isn't it?
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>That's why I'm asking you to take them down. They should be in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>".
I'm counting on you, buddy! <cf>Come back here when you're done!
<cf>Go and beat up those <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>!
I'll collect the fruit while I'm at it. <cf>Come back when you're done!
Hey, good job! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Sounds like you've done it!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> If you can beat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>, you're going a good distance. <cf>There are a lot of guys who struggle with this.
I found some fruit, too, and <cf>delivered it all to Obasan.
<cf>She was so happy. <cf>It makes me happy to see her smile!
<cf>"I want to think about what the client needs, not just what is asked of me.
This is my creed.
Well, I'm mostly following my mentor's line of thinking!
One day I will be a heavy smasher like my master. <cf>Master has always been my goal.
Actually, I'm on a journey to find my master. <cf>This is part of my training.
<cf>I've been given a task to find a master somewhere.
<cf>I want to introduce you to him. <cf>I'll be in touch soon!
<cf>Thank you! <cf>You've done a great job!
Hey, how's it going? <cf>Let's go for another smackdown today!
I still don't know where the master went. <cf>Well, I'll keep looking.
<cf>I'd love to fight with you again! <cf>Let's go for something bigger this time. <cf>Let's go for something bigger this time, I'm looking forward to it!
Found a crate of veggies.
Hey, what do you think? <cf> Getting used to the heavy smasher fighting style?
Maybe it's time for me to get a new weapon. <cf>You should try a new one too!
Hey, good to see you here! <cf>Could you do me a favor?
I was going to go <cf>to another region soon to look for my master.
<cf>I heard a story about a missing kid in Minsterhorn.
He went to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/> to pick up some nuts and <cf>he never came back.
It's dangerous for a child to go out there alone. <cf>I hope he wasn't attacked by a monster. ......
You can't leave this guy alone, can you?
The people of Minsterhorn took care of him. <cf>They are so laid-back and cozy there.
<cf>I was doing all the work they asked me to do, and they even remembered my face.
<cf>This was not the time to be leisurely! <cf>Let's go find the kid now!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" <cf>There must be a garrison of the Buffarian Order in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>.
Maybe they are protected there. <cf>Let's meet up at the garrison first!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>, we'll meet up at the "garrison". <cf>Maybe there are some kids there.
There are a lot of nasty monsters in that area. <cf>We'd better be ready for them.
Hey, good job! <cf>The kid from Minsterhorn doesn't seem to be here.
I didn't see him on the way here either. ...... <cf>Wonder where he wandered off to.
I had a similar experience a long time ago.
I got lost in the woods and was attacked by a monster. <cf>It was my mentor who saved me.
<cf>I was just a kid, and I was scared. <cf>So I had to save him!
Some of the stories I heard were a little bit dangerous. ......
<cf>I heard she was collecting nuts. <cf>These are the rumblebores' favorite food.
He might be chasing the kid around because of the smell.
Okay, let's split up the roles. <cf>Omae, I want you to chase off the <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>.
If you take down a few of them, the rest of the herd should run away.
If the heavy smashers go on a rampage, <cf>even the monsters will know they're in trouble.
In the meantime, I'll look for the kid. <cf>I'll know what they look like, and maybe they'll notice.
I'm counting on you. Don't be shy. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>and blow them to smithereens!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> of "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>"<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>" <cf>Take out every last one of them!
In the meantime, I'll find the kid. <cf>Thank you. Don't be shy!
Hey, thanks! Thanks for getting rid of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>!
See, here's the deal. <cf>I found the prankster and caught him.
Damn, you're such a pussy! <cf>I told you not to go far alone.
Because these nuts are the most delicious.
I'll give some to my sister Maschietta. <cf>You can only pick these in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>!
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>Don't be like that. <cf>You're gonna get blown away by this guy.
......Yeah, it's good. <cf>Maybe I'll come back and pick it up.
I'm sure they will!
I'm glad you found it anyway. <cf>Thanks to you!
<cf>Well, let's get you back to Minsterhorn, shall we? <cf>I'd hate to see you get lost on your own again.
Sorry for dragging you along. <cf>Will you hang out with me just a little bit longer?
Let's give the kid a ride to Minsterhorn.
Thanks for your help! <cf> I got that kid a step ahead of you and delivered him to his mother's place.
She was soooo grateful to you too. <cf>[<cf>[Take care of him.
Well, it's a good feeling after doing something good!
Maybe this is how my mentor felt too. <cf>I was helping people here and there.
I feel like I'm getting a little closer again. <cf>Well, I'm still a little out of reach.
Well, I'm back to looking for my mentor.
I don't think he's in the Asteria Plains, <cf>so maybe it's time to look elsewhere.
I'd like to introduce you to my mentor,<cf> so please give me a call again if you like. See you later!
I'll be going around looking for my mentor, but <cf>I'm going to stay at Asterlys!
I'm going to stay at the Asterlys, <cf>where all kinds of stories are told.
If you see me, give me a shout. <cf>Don't go through that, okay?　You'll miss me.
<cf>Well, Master. <cf>I don't know where he is. ......
<cf>Maybe he'll come to Asterlys. <cf>I ain't leaving here anytime soon.
<cf>I can't leave here! <cf>Sorry to keep you company again.
A while back, I went down to <cf>Lalpar</cf> looking for my mentor.
I heard something that caught my attention.
I heard that <cf>someone had broken into some of the food and luggage that I had stored there. ......
It sounded just like a request I've worked on before.
Well, technically, it was a request my mentor got.
When I was still half a man, <cf>we went to Larpal together.
It's a bitter ...... memory. <cf>I messed up and got my master in trouble.
The luggage vandals at that time were monsters.
If that's the case again this time, people in the city are in danger. <cf>I'm curious, so I'd like to find out.
I'd like to have some help if possible. <cf>It would be great if you guys could come!
Let's go to Larpal first and gather some clues.
We can talk to people in town, check out the baggage claim area, ....... <cf>We'll meet up with you there once we've gathered enough information!
Let's go to L'Alparu and <cf>gather clues on who ransacked our stuff!
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>You have some questions for me?
Oh, you're talking about the guy who ransacked our stuff.
Of course I know. <cf>And I saw something that night!
I saw a pack of beasts running near the city!
So many eyes glowing in the dark, <cf> and I could hear them roaring!
It was scary as hell! <cf>I was afraid that if they found me, they would bite me.
What kind of beast was it?　Well, it was a ......
It was four-legged,...... like a wolf, I think. <cf>They were small and quick.
They left <cf>sharp scratches all around the baggage area.
They appear to have been inflicted by claws or fangs.
Maschietta's right. <cf> Maybe the monsters were responsible for the baggage vandalism.
Hey, what do you think? Did you find any clues to <cf> luggage vandalism?
Hmmm... ....... <cf>Some people have seen packs of beasts and claw and fang marks.
I found some monster hairs and footprints, too.
I'm thinking that, in combination with the clues, ......<cf>they raided the luggage <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01_01001"/>.
That's what happened to me and my mentor.
Those guys hunt in packs and they are smart. <cf> They probably know where to put their prey.
We got rid of them then, but <cf>they haven't learned their lesson and they're back.
You've got some nerve, don't you?
All right!　Let's finish this up. <cf>We'll take down <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>!
We need to show him that human summons is scary. <cf>Then they'll stay away from Ralparu.
<cf>We'll get taken advantage of in one place, so let's go on a rampage in two places, me and you!
Let's go after the guys in <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>. <cf>They'll be coming to L'Alpar.
<cf>We'll meet up with them here when they're done. <cf>Well then, let's get started!
Let's split up and <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>defeat them! Don't leave <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>", okay?
We'll meet up here when we're done. <cf>Because this should keep Larpal quiet.
Yo, good job! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> Looks like we're done defeating them!
Good, good. <cf>After all this, we should be good to go.
I'm glad it's all over. <cf>Thanks to your help.
I used to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> just like my mentor did. ......
There was one guy who was a hell of a lot tougher than the rest. <cf>I got backed into a corner by him.
If it wasn't for my mentor's help, I would have been in real danger. <cf>But he was so cool at that time!
...... Oh, no. <cf>That's not what I wanted to talk about.
<cf>I was really frustrated. <cf>I was so disappointed because I was dragging him down. ......
<cf>I'm really glad it went well today! <cf>I've grown up a lot since then.
Thanks, man! <cf>I'll definitely brag about you when I find my mentor!
<cf>I'll definitely brag about you when I find my mentor! <cf>All right!　I'll go look for you again!
<cf>You were so cool when you saved me!
He'd just appear like this, and then he'd just go, <cf>Do it!　And then, <cf>boom!　And then, <cf> he just blasted the monsters out of the sky. ......
I was just in awe of him. ...... <cf>Ah, master, where have you gone?
Remember the previous <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>defeat?
I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere. <cf>There wasn't even that really strong guy. ......
Was that really the end of it? ......
Hey, dude. <cf>Have you heard of the "Sapphire Trot"?
Remember when <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> trashed the <cf>baggage claim in Ralparu?
The same thing happened again.
A <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> herd went out to Larpall, and <cf>the leader was at the front of it.
That guy was "Sapphire Trot". <cf>I have a history with him.
I told you that a long time ago, my mentor and I fought <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> in the same way.
I also told you that I almost got <cf>returned</cf> by one of the stronger ones.
It had blue fur, and it was <cf>superiorly quicker, stronger, and smarter than the other one.
That's the Sapphire Trot.
I didn't see him when I went with you. <cf>But I guess he was just hiding.
He was watching us in the shadows, <cf>sure we'd get rid of the other <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>s and be safe.
That's what he does, that bastard ......!
Now that we're gone, the Sapphire Trot can <cf>roam the warehouses with impunity!
<cf>The people of Ralparu can't rest easy now. <cf>I can't make my clients smile!
Besides, I owe them a debt from the past.
I want to take down the Sapphire Trot. <cf>Please. <cf>Please lend me your power!
There must be someone in Larpal who saw him. <cf>Let's talk to him!
<cf>There must be someone in Larpal who saw the Sapphire Trot!
We've got to get him this time! <cf>First, let's gather some information about him.
Have you seen the Sapphire Trot?
Yeah, we've got a package break-in. <cf> We've been alerted.
Some said they saw ["]a blue wolf["].
They say it's a frighteningly wary and clever monster. <cf> They say it's known among the locals.
Are you looking for one too? <cf> Then you should look for the "Hill of God's Watchful Eye".
They seem to have made that area their territory. <cf> But it's going to be tough to find.
We have yet to discover it. <cf>They don't show themselves to people easily.
The "Sapphire Trot" ......? <cf>Yes, I know it.
I've seen it a few times, but from a distance.
They have blue fur and they are so beautiful. <cf>It looks so docile. ......
<cf>They are actually much stronger and more dangerous monsters than <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>.
Don't let appearances deceive you. <cf>I keep telling my children that.
Where are they?　Well, I can't give you all the details: ......
<cf> But I've seen him near the city. <cf>I think he's somewhere on "God's Watch Hill".
I'm sure he's somewhere on the Hill of God's Watchful Eye! <cf>Did you get any info on the "Sapphire Trot"?
It looks like he's the real culprit in the package raid after all.
He got away with it! <cf> Damn it!　That's not going to happen this time!
But the key is where he's hiding. <cf>Where the hell is he hiding ......
What?　You figured it out!
Somewhere on "God's Watch Hill" ....... <cf> You're doing great!　That's awesome, dude!
Okay, then it's easy!　Then the story is simple.
It's obvious, isn't it?　Me and you are going to blow up the <cf>Sapphire Trot</cf>!
That bastard is leading the pack. <cf>If we destroy the leader, the others will scatter.
They'll never try to attack Larpal again!
This time I'm going to make the people of Larpal smile. <cf>And I'm going to pay back all my old debts!
Let's go!　To the roost of the Sapphire Trot!
It looks like the Sapphire Trot is roosting somewhere on the Hill of God's Watchful Eye.
Well, once you know that, it's easy. <cf>Now, let's go kick some ass together!
If we take him down, this case is closed!
Okay, here it is: ....... I got a glimpse. <cf> The blue shadow of the Sapphire Trot.
Oops, my hands are shaking. <cf> What is it?　A warrior's tremor, huh? That's not like me.
Heh, to tell you the truth. <cf>I'm looking forward to it a little.
<cf> I was beaten to a pulp the last time I was here. <cf>I didn't think I could get revenge like this.
<cf>I never thought I'd be able to get back at it like this. <cf>There's no better opponent to see how strong I've become since then!
Don't hide behind your master's back this time. <cf>I'll be able to fight side by side with my friends!
<cf>Yes, I'm fired up! <cf>You're ready too, right?
The Sapphire Trot! <cf> Let's make them regret making an enemy of us!
<cf> You see this? <cf> You see that, you son of a bitch?
<cf>Yes, we did it! <cf>We beat that sapphire trotter!
Thanks to your help. Thanks for your help!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> got away too. <cf>Now this herd is done for.
They don't have the <cf>wits and guts</cf> to steal food from where people live!
Now, let's go back to Ralph's and tell everyone what happened.
It feels good to go home with our heads held high! <cf>I'll tell them all about your saga!
<cf>It's because you came with me that we were able to defeat the Sapphire Trot!
Thank you! <cf>Well, let's go back to Ralparu and tell everyone about it!
Hey, thanks for your help! <cf>Thank you so much for your help this time. Thanks a lot.
They were very grateful too. <cf>They said they were glad to have an adventurer they can count on.
They should have given me a little praise too!
Haha, kidding, kidding! <cf> I've got a little something off my chest thanks to you too.
<cf> I've been thinking about how I've been dragging my master down.
The sapphire trot got its way, and <cf>this time it was going to happen again.
But I finally got it all done.
And, best of all. <cf>The people of Larpal are safe now!
Their stuff won't be ransacked, and <cf>they won't be scared of the "Sapphire Trot"!
<cf>Well, if you think about it, it's as if we <cf>just cleaned up Master's unfinished business together, isn't it?
Heh heh, that's good! <cf>I've got something to bring back to the master!
Yay!　Wait for me, master! <cf>I'll find you soon!
Let's both brag about it! <cf>I heard there's more to that case that you don't know!
I've met a lot of heavy smashers, but <cf>you're a little special.
You've helped me shake off the past, and in many ways I feel like <cf>you're one of us.
Maybe that's what my mentor was trying to tell me <cf> to look for in a guy like you.
As a senior Blitzlancer, <cf>how should I teach the younger guys ......?
I don't want to show them anything uncool. <cf>I still want to show them how dependable I am!
Yo!　Are you the new Blitzlancer?
I'm Currant! <cf>I may look like this, but I'm your senior. Nice to meet you!
I'm going to teach you the <cf>basics</cf> of being a Blitzlancer.
I want you to become a strong BlitzLancer!
I was a senior member when I was just starting out. <cf>Now, as a senior, I want to help my juniors.
So as a senior, I want to practice teaching the juniors! <cf>You, come hang out with me for a minute!
It's okay! <cf>I've been a BlitzLancer for a while now.
First of all, ...... I guess so. <cf>A Blitzlancer has to be able to fight!
Okay, let's go out there and fight some monsters!　Let's go out there and kill some monsters!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>" <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_00_01001"/>. <cf> Practice your Blitz Lancer skills against them!
Meet me just outside Asterlys. <cf>Don't be late, junior!
Alright!　<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Let's take them down. Let's go!
First, we need to know what the Blitzlancer is a <cf> class with what characteristics.
The Blitzlancer's most important feature is that it can <cf>impart an "imprint" on its opponents!
The 'imprint' is a weakness, so to speak. <cf>Give them a weakness, and strike at it!
After you poke them, you give them the "imprint" again!　And then poke!
Repeating this process is <cf> the basic strategy of the Blitz Lancer!
Sounds easy, right? <cf>But it's still very deep!
Okay, then!　Let's put it into practice. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Let's try to fight them with the "Mark"!
I'll go out there and properly defeat them too. <cf>Because it's not good to let only juniors do it!
<cf>We'll meet back here when we're done!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>! <cf> Try to use your Blitzlancer skills too!
<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Defeat, are you done?　Good job!
You're ...... Blitzlancer's junior, right? <cf>Really?
I couldn't do it that well the first time. <cf>I even had some help from my seniors.
That ......?　I'm a senior and I don't need ......?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　No, no, no, you're not ready! <cf>The road to Blitzlancer is long and hard!
I should <cf>be able to mentor the juniors as a senior too. Yup!
Thanks for today! <cf>I'll teach you about BlitzLancer some other time!
<cf>Please come along with me to practice so I can be more like a senior. Nice to meet you!
What would you like me to teach you next time ......
I'd be bored just fighting, <cf>I'd like to do something to keep you occupied.
Hey, how are you doing?　How's it going? <cf>Have you become a better blitz lancer?
I still have a lot to <cf>teach you. ......
<cf>I'm bored just fighting monsters all the time. <cf>I was the same way, and I know exactly what you mean.
That's why I got a request at the pioneer station this time.
Let's practice <cf>Blitzlancer</cf> while we take care of this one!
Of course, I'll pay you well. <cf>I'm not going to let you be the only one!
The request is to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>collect "Red and Blue Violets"!
But there seems to be <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> around the area where the "red and blue violets" grow.
It's hard to ask the <cf>Pioneering Bureau</cf> every time we need "Red and Blue Violets", isn't it?
So, let's get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> ourselves!
Well then, off we go to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>! <cf>Meet us at Minsterhorn!
Pioneer station request and Blitzlancer practice. <cf>Wouldn't it be more efficient if we could do it together?
Well then, let's meet up at Minsterhorn first.
Alright, you're here. <cf>Then let's collect "Red and Blue Violets" first!
This one is a request from the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I'd better not forget.
I'll check on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> in the meantime. <cf>The seniors have to take the lead on the dangerous stuff!
You don't have to worry about it, just collect the "red and blue violets.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> and you can fight, but don't overdo it. <cf>I'll teach you how to fight them later, I promise.
When you're done collecting, come back here!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/> to collect "Red and Blue Violets". <cf>It's a request from the Pioneer Bureau, so we'll have to remember to do it.
I'll check on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> in the meantime. <cf>When you're done collecting, come back here.
Yo, good work! <cf>Did you find the "Red and Blue Violets"?
Let's see. ....... <cf>Yeah, it looks like we got the right number. Thanks!
I checked the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> one too.
There were quite a few. That one might get close to <cf>Minsterhorn</cf>.
Let's cut their numbers down before that happens.
Didn't we <cf>talk before about Blitzlancer being able to give the "imprint"?
How does a Blitzlancer go about doing that?
After an attack, the basic rule is to get out of range right away. <cf>If you get greedy and try to attack repeatedly, it will hurt you.
Don't be in a hurry, you have to put in one blow at a time. <cf>It's dangerous to be surrounded by other monsters.
You know, what experienced people say is very persuasive. <cf>...... yeah. That time was really bad. ......
I think <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> are swarming, but <cf>avoid taking on the whole swarm.
Try to fight them as if you were going to do a bunch of one-on-ones.
Alright, let's go!　Let's go <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>and take them down!
Let's split up and get rid of them! <cf>When we're done, we'll meet up at the usual place in Asterlys.
Let's use the BlitzLancer technique to defeat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Split up and get rid of them. <cf>When you're done, meet me at the usual place in Asterlys!
Wow!　You're done taking them down already?
I worked so hard and <cf>just barely finished a step early. ......
The first time I <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>killed it, it took me even longer, <cf>and I got help from my seniors. ......
Damn, I like it. ...... <cf>I'm jealous that you're so strong...... gusu......
Ha!　I'm not crying!　I'm not crying! <cf>Senpai doesn't cry!
...... but I really envy you. <cf>You're so cool even though you're my junior!
Me. There's someone I admire, like a mentor.
He's a Blitzlancer, a senior adventurer who I took care of.
Someday, I want to be as strong and <cf>reliable as him.
I don't know, you're not exactly the <cf>junior</cf> I imagined you'd be. ......
But I'm still your senior!
I'm going to train harder so that I don't lose to you as a junior! <cf>I need your help again, so I'll see you next time!
When you get used to Blitzlancer, <cf>you should stick to your weapon too!
It's part of your ability to use the right weapon for you. <cf>Oh, you're talking like a senior, me!
Haha ....... <cf>Sorry for asking you to do something so pathetic.
I took on two requests at once.
One is to collect a plant called "roadside starflower" and the other is to kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/>.
Both of these are to be done in the Baha Mar Plateau, but <cf>I'm not enough help to do it alone. ......
Sorry! <cf>Please help me out as a bad senior!
Actually, I heard my senior is coming to Lalpar. <cf> See, that's the senior I told you about, the one I've been helping out with.
<cf>I just wanted to show him my good side anyway,<cf>so I took the request too far. ......
<cf>I'm going to ask you to collect "starflowers by the roadside" for me. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/>I'll take down the enemy!
I'm your senior!　Leave the dangerous stuff to me!
Maybe you'll finish faster than me, so <cf>when you get together, you can come to me.
I'll be at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" on the Baha Mar Plateau. <cf>You should be able to find "Roadside Star Grass" there.
I'll be looking forward to seeing you there!　See you later!
I'll be at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/> in the Baha Mar Plateau, <cf>pick up some roadside starflowers</cf>.
I'm <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/> taking down the enemy, so <cf>when you're done, come to me.
Damn, ugh ....... <cf> Such a pathetic ...... gush!
Ugh!　Oh, you! <cf>No, I'm not crying!　I'm not crying!
I'm ...... lying. Sorry, I was crying. ......
I'm just ...... a little, you know, embarrassed.
I'm ...... really not that good at <cf> fighting monsters!
I can do it reasonably well now, but <cf>when I first became a blitzlancer, I wasn't at all.
I taught you that Blitzlancer is all about one-on-one, right? <cf>But sometimes I'm afraid to do that.
I was just glancing at <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/> and <cf>suddenly my body stopped moving and I got blown away.
And he blew me off and got away.
I was in such a good mood that I took on two ...... and <cf>I was so pathetic I started to cry!
I'm so embarrassed and frustrated, <cf>but the most important thing right now is to finish the job!
Sorry again. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/>Could you also take down the enemy?
My hands are shaking and I can't get a good grip on my spear.
I think I twisted my leg a little, <cf>so I'll just sit here and wait.
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/> and come back. <cf>Please do me a favor!
Take down <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/> for me. <cf>This sounds pathetic, but please do me a favor.
I'll stay here and keep quiet. <cf>Will you come back when you're done?
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/> for taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>! <cf>Thank you!　You saved my life, man.
...... haha. <cf>I was totally spinning my wheels this time.
You know what made me want to become an adventurer? <cf>I simply wanted to be strong.
<cf>I lost my parents early on, and my body was weak, so I was always giving people trouble.
I tried to at least get physically fit, but <cf>I couldn't do it as well as I wanted to. ......
Then someone approached me, a senior I admire.
He taught me how to train my body, how to be an adventurer, and <cf>most importantly, he taught me about BlitzLancer.
That's how I became a BlitzLancer.
But I just couldn't get over facing the enemy one-on-one<cf>until the end.
I thought if I could defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/> here, <cf>I could show my senpai that I had grown up.
I'm so disappointed. ...... I'm treated like a child again. ......
......There's no time to cry. <cf>The client is waiting for me. <cf>I had a client waiting for me.
Let's deliver "Roadside Star Grass" to Ralpal. <cf> I don't want to see my senpai for ...... a bit, but...
Ah!　You are the adventurer who accepted our request, aren't you?
This is indeed "Roadside Star Grass". <cf>Thank you!
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_00_01001"/>I also took it down. <cf>Not me, but my junior, though.
So, you know,<cf>I heard a story about adventurers other than us coming here,<cf> ......
Oh, you're the <cf>Blitzlancer</cf> who said he was looking for that legendary spear.
We had a request for him to take down another monster, <cf>he finished successfully and left a little while ago.
A passing. <cf>It's both disappointing and relieving: ......
Is that guy still looking for the legendary spear?
That's what he said. <cf>I think it was ...... "Zenith Shaft"?
He's my senior, after all. <cf> That man is looking for a spear called "Zenith Shaft".
<cf>It's a spear from an old legend and has been in the hands of many brave men.
Of course, it may not exist, and <cf>even if it did, it would be in tatters.
Still, he said he wanted to check it out.
......If I find the "Zenith Shaft", <cf>will my seniors approve of me......
U...... was right. I was trying to look good <cf>and got you in trouble. Sorry.
But it was good that I asked you. <cf>Because my senpai told me before.
[Don't try to do things alone. Don't try to do it alone.
<cf>Thank you for this time. <cf>I hope I can repay you someday.
<cf>Don't try to do everything alone. <cf>Take care of your friends.
That's what my senpai told me. It's true.
I think my senior is still looking for the legendary spear.
If I find a clue, I might be able to help him. <cf> No. ......
If I find that spear, <cf>I think he'll be more surprised.
Hey, you. <cf>Do you remember the "Zenith Shaft" spear?
See? I told you about it on the last commission, didn't I? <cf> The legendary spear that my senpai is looking for.
Actually, I'm trying to find the "Zenith Shaft.
If I can find it before my senpai does, it will give me a lot of confidence.
Even if I can't find it, I think it won't be a waste.
It's not enough to just admire senpai. <cf>I need to take action, get results, and get recognition.
But I know I might screw up again if I go it alone, so <cf>I need your help. I'm counting on you.
So, you know. I've been doing some research, and I found someone who knows about <cf>Zenith Shaft</cf>!
A merchant in Litze is willing to teach me about the Zenith Shaft in exchange for a commission.
I'd like to go talk to him right away, if that's all right.
The request is to kill the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> that appears in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>.
It's not that hard, so let's just get rid of it quickly!
It is said that "Zenith Shafts" appear to the brave. It would be great if it appeared in front of us!
After defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>, we will meet at Litze!
Let's take out the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>!
When you're done, meet at Litze. <cf>Let's go talk to the client about the "Zenith Shaft".
Gghhhh...... ughhhh...... damn it....... <cf> Damn you ...... ugh ......!
You're still a crybaby, currant. <cf>It's time to calm down. ...... hmm?
Who are you?　You know Currant?
Oh ...... you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> have you finished defeating them?
Mr. Rugel. <cf>This is my junior Blitzlancer!
Oh, is that right? <cf>Currant told me about you. He said you have a great junior.
I'm Rugel. Nice to meet you. <cf> I used to take care of Caranto.
Ah, Caranto? <cf> I intercepted a prize. I did a bad thing.
No, you didn't!　I was caught off guard and ......<cf>Mr. Rugel saved my life.
He saw me looking shabby again and ......Ugh......
You're not ready for this, currant. <cf>Well, it's better if you can cry tears.
Here, patch up your wounds. <cf>You were hit pretty hard.
Yeah. ...... ...... Huh?　Eh, no!
You dropped the "Mashie's Elixir"......!
The elixir of Massey?　Is it that potion I used to do?
Oh no. I'd love to find it, but ......<cf> I've got my own request, and I've got to get going.
Sorry. Can I leave you in charge?
<cf>Currant's not going to be able to move for a while. <cf>I want you to look for "Massey's elixir" for him.
<cf>Currant, be on your guard now. See you later.
Sorry ....... I'm sorry I even bothered you.
<cf>The Medicine of the Massey is like a good luck charm for me.
Rugel gave it to me and it's very important. ......
<cf>I'm sure it's somewhere on the Ritze Trading Road. <cf>Find it and bring it to me.
The "Mashie's Medicine" is like a <cf> good luck charm</cf> given to me by Mr. Rugel.
I found a small medicine bottle.
It seems to be the "Mashie's elixir" that Currant was looking for. <cf>I'll deliver it to Litze.
<cf>"Massey's elixir", did you find it?
Sure, here it is!　Thank you!
This medicine was found in the ruins by Mr. Rugel.
When I was starting out, he used it <cf>when I was injured, like now. It works well, man.
So he gave me the rest. <cf>He told me to use the rest in case of emergency, since it was so little.
I was taking good care of it, and I can't believe I lost it. ...... <cf>And now, with Rugel's help, I'm in this mess.
As a Blitzlancer and as an adventurer,<cf>I'm pathetic,......
...... Damn, how long am I going to keep fretting? <cf> You're in the middle of a request!
Sorry. <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>Taking down the enemy was the main issue, right? <cf>The client is in Litze, let's go report back!
I know we took a detour, but <cf>I need to know about the "Zenith Shaft".
Thanks for finding the "Mashie's Elixir".
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>, and I thought we were here to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>. <cf>The client is a merchant from Litze. Let's go report it.
Oh, are you the adventurer who killed <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>?
Yes, I am. <cf>But he did most of the work.
You can pay him for his services. <cf>I have something else I want you to tell me.
I heard that you know about the "Zenith Shaft,"<cf> Mr. Merchant.
The "Zenith Shaft"? Yes, I know. <cf>It's a legendary spear that emits a blue light.
Some years ago, I <cf>met an adventurer with a spear like that.
He said it was a spear he found in some ruins.
It was battered and useless as a weapon, but it <cf>did glow blue.
The owner, however, seemed to have disappeared <cf> in the course of defeating a monster.
I haven't seen it since!
I see. ...... <cf>So you don't know where it is now?
I'm sorry about that. <cf>By the way, there is someone who heard the same story.
I thought you said your name was Mr. Rugel.
Is this a story that you already know, Mr. Rugel? <cf> That's right.
Hmmm, indeed, I wonder if it would be difficult to find <cf>"Zenith Shaft" before Mr. Rugel does: ......
No, you shouldn't give up so easily! <cf>Then you're no better than I ever was.
I'll do some more research on the adventurers and the blue glowing spear.
<cf>I've shown Mr. Rugel some mercy this time. <cf>This time I showed Mr. Rugel how pathetic I am, and you too. So I've got to make up for it!
I'm going to find it, the Zenith Shaft! <cf>I'm going to play a game with you, Mr. Rugel!
<cf>And what Rugel doesn't know about the Zenith Shaft: ......
I'm sure he's already looked into the legends and ruins. <cf>Then what's left?
Yo, good job! <cf>I'm thinking of going to take down an ogre this time.
<cf>I've got a few things on my mind. <cf>It may have something to do with "Zenith Shaft".
You mentioned that a merchant in Litze met an <cf>adventurer</cf> with a glowing blue spear, right?
I have a feeling that the place where that adventurer went missing and the place where the <cf> ogre appeared are close.
It's just a hunch, though.
The Pioneer Bureau keeps records of adventurers who belong to them. <cf>I'd like to check there first.
If it has anything to do with the Zenith Shaft,<cf> then of course I'm going to go there to take down the ogre.
<cf>I'll need your help then. <cf>Thank you!
First, let's go to the second floor of the Pioneering Bureau. Let's check the bookshelf.
Zenith Shaft" appears before the heroes. ...... <cf>I'll find it before Mr. Rugel does!
<cf>The records of adventurers who seem to have the Zenith Shaft should be in the bookshelf of the Pioneering Bureau.
Let's check there first. <cf>Is it related to the Montenour Valley Ogre? ......
Found it! <cf>The record of an adventurer who had a "Zenith Shaft".
It says, "["]An adventurer with an ancient spear that glows blue ["]. <cf>This is it, no doubt!
That's a record from a few years ago. <cf>["]Received a request to defeat an ogre in the Melisos River basin["]......
After that, he never returned to ......["]and was not contacted ["]. <cf>["]The request is considered to have failed["]......
Hmmm, maybe I don't have a choice, but ......<cf>I wouldn't want to be on record as such.
...... hmm?　This auger....... <cf>Hasn't he been out of sight since the request?
Maybe the ...... adventurers didn't win, but <cf>they were able to hunt down the ogre!
So maybe the ogre that was healing its wounds <cf>recently went on the rampage again!
I'm curious. <cf>I guess I better actually check it out after all!
Okay, let's go to the "Melissos River Basin"! <cf>Maybe there are traces of "Zenith Shaft" and adventurers!
It seems that an ogre appeared in the Montenour Valley and fought an adventurer with a Zenith Shaft.
Let's go to the "Melissos River Valley! <cf> There may be traces of the Zenith Shaft and adventurers!
Mr. Rugel!
What's wrong? <cf>You're badly hurt, aren't you?
Currant...... and you too......
I heard that adventurers with "Zenith Shafts" <cf>have been in the area. ......
I was checking it out and came across an ogre. <cf>An ogre with a battered spear on his back.
That's ...... "Zenith Shaft"!
Oh. I was distracted by that guy too. <cf>And then I got caught in the gap, and here I am!
Mr. Rugel, did you come here alone?　That's absurd.
[Don't try to do it alone. Mr. Rugel taught me to take care of my friends.
The 'Zenith Shaft' is my personal obsession. <cf>I don't feel comfortable bringing anyone else into this.
Then you could have told me. ......
...... Mr. Rugel. Here's what you need.
The "Massey's Secret Medicine" ......? <cf>That's gone. I can't use it.
It's okay. Use it and rest.
We'll take down the ogre. <cf>We'll get the "Zenith Shaft" too.
Currant...... you, you're dealing with an ogre. <cf>Are you going to be okay?
I don't think I could if I were alone. <cf>On the contrary, I think I'd be panicking and crying.
But I'm calm now. <cf>I've got my friends with me who I can rely on.
I'm sorry I decided to do this on my own. <cf>Will you fight the ogre with me?
Thank you! <cf>I knew you would come with me!
...... You've grown up, Currant.
I'm a Blitzlancer too. <cf>I can't be pathetic forever!
Come on, let's go! <cf>Let's kill the ogre and get the "Zenith Shaft"!
The ogre that had the "Zenith Shaft" must be somewhere in the <cf>"Melissos River Basin"!
It must be some kind of loot or something. <cf>It's not going to be used as a weapon, so don't worry about it.
However, the ogre itself is still dangerous. <cf>Don't let your guard down.
But still, that currant guy ....... <cf>He's getting cocky.
There he is, that ogre. ......
Looks like this is where he sleeps. <cf>"Zenith Shaft" is lying near ......
We can't just take that one home with us. <cf>We still have to defeat the ogre.
No, we'll be fine, okay? <cf>We've been planning to fight from the beginning.
Mr. Rugel got beat up, <cf>I'm not going to feel bad if I don't give him back!
I'm a Blitzlancer! <cf>I can't just sit back and let my friends get beat up!
Come on, brace yourself!　Ogre! <cf>We'll take you down!
Hah, hah ...... and yay ......
<span size="Big">Yay! </>
We did it, we did it! <cf>We killed the ogre!　We did it!
Ha-ha-ha!　You did it, man! <cf> I beat that ogre!　Amazing!
[--]Ah!　Yes, "Zenith Shaft"!
Oh, no, no. I almost forgot. <cf> Is this the "Zenith Shaft" ......
It's so old and tattered. <cf>But it surely glows blue.
It's the legendary spear Mr. Rugel was looking for.
...... What?　[The spear that appears before ["]brave men"]? <cf> There was such a legend, though.
<cf> If I said that, it would make an ogre a brave man too. <cf>Maybe it's not about me.
Come on, let's go back to Mr. Rugel! <cf>I'm sure he'll be glad to see this spear!
We got the ogre down, and <cf>we got the "Zenith Shaft"!
Great result!　Thank you! <cf>Now, let's go back to Mr. Rugel!
You're back. <cf>...... from the looks of it, it looks like you did it!
Hehehe......<span size="Big">Jaan! </>
How's it going?　Mr. Rugel! <cf>This is the "Zenith Shaft", a spear that emits blue light!
Oh, no doubt. <cf>This is the "Zenith Shaft" I've been looking for.
I didn't expect you to beat me to it, Currant.
I finally did it!
That's quite an accomplishment. Caranto. <cf>Now you won't be afraid to fight, will you?
Oh, by the way, when I fought the ...... ogre, <cf>I didn't even think about being afraid!
That's proof that you're really strong now.
Besides, you have such great friends. <cf> I couldn't have done that as a lone wolf.
Let me thank you, too. <cf>Thank you for helping me with Caranto.
I didn't fight alone, we fought together. <cf> This must have been a great experience for Caranto.
Currant. You joined forces with your comrades so you could <cf>get the "Zenith Shaft".
You are the real brave man who deserves this spear.
Mr. Rugel,...... ugh, ugh,......<cf> ugh,......!
What, are you crying again?
This is a happy cry! <cf>I'm so happy that Mr. Rugel recognized me......
Gosh, ugh! <cf>But even Mr. Rugel is one of our friends!
<cf>I'm going to fight with you from now on as a BlitzLancer too!
Pfft, you're getting cocky. ...... <cf>All right. Take care of me, buddy.
Yes, sir!
Thanks for all your help! <cf>It didn't matter if you were my senior or not.
<cf>I've learned a lot from you, and I've learned a lot from you. <cf>Most importantly, you helped me grow.
Someday, I'm going to help you! <cf>I can't say it enough. Thank you so much!
<cf>I left the Zenith Shaft with the Pioneering Bureau. <cf>As part of my legacy, they gave it to me as research material.
In any case, it was too battered to <cf>use</cf> as a weapon.
I didn't need to rely on the legendary spear to fight. <cf>I'll have to keep training more and more!
Han!　If you're going to pick a class, how about <cf>Beat Performer?
It's a <cf>one-of-a-kind class that combines sound and battle. I'm stoked!
It's a new class and we need to show people we're interested. <cf>If you're interested, give it a shot!
Han!　Thanks for coming! <cf>I'm Glenn, the beat performer.
<cf>Are you like a new beat performer too? <cf>Then you're just like me. Nice to meet you!
<cf>Beat Performers are a relatively new class. <cf>And I'm not new to this class, am I?
Compared to the Aegis Fighter, it's a <cf>recent class</cf>.
Maybe that's why I don't think the real appeal of the Beat Performer is <cf>known</cf> by everyone.
There is no other class as hot, as cool, as cool as the beat performers!
<cf>But they don't get it. <cf>That's why I decided to make a big show of it!
<cf>So why don't we start by completing one request? <cf>The request is to take down Uribo in the "Sea Rhythm Meadow.
Hm?　Is it a request that requires two people to do? <cf> Well, the other party is Uribo.
<cf>To put it bluntly, it's so simple that no one would take it on. <cf>The people at the pioneering bureau were having a bit of a hard time with it.
That's why. Why don't we, the beat performers, take on <cf> this guy and do it perfectly?
Do what others won't do! <cf> And we'll get a good reputation as beat performers, too, right?
Han!　That's a good idea! <cf>It's the little things like this that count!
<cf>Well, since we both have to get ready, let's meet up outside the gates of Asterlys.
Don't go ahead by yourself, okay? <cf>See you later. <cf>See you later!
We're going to the Sea of Rumbling Grass to take down Uribo. <cf>We're not much of a challenge, but let's be prepared.
I'll meet you outside the gates of Asterlys later. <cf>Don't go ahead by yourself, okay?
Han!　I think I'm ready! <cf>Let's go, let's take down Uribo!
The beat performer's main job is to support his friends. <cf>It's when you fight with someone else that you shine!
<cf>Since we're here, let's go over some of the things we've learned. Let's review a few things.
<cf> The first thing a beat performer should have is this weapon. <cf>A weapon that looks like a musical instrument...... or is it a musical instrument that looks like a weapon?
Well, anyway!　The beat performer's main skill is to use it to <cf>sound</cf> the beat performer!
The Beat Performer's sound has various effects, such as strengthening allies and attacking<cf>enemies!
Use your sound to bring the battle to your advantage. <cf>This is the role of the Beat Performer.
Of course, the beat performer can also fight. <cf>Weapons are designed for hand-to-hand combat.
<cf>You can't do anything without your friends.
<cf>This time, our opponent is Uribo, who is in the "Sea Rhythm Meadow. <cf>With this, we can fight alone.
I mean, I don't think it's a good idea to just go up to Uribo and beat him up. ......
<cf>We'll take out three each, you and me. <cf>If we each take them out, we'll have accomplished our mission.
<cf>Let's get this over with, shall we? <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done.
Han!　[I'm on a rolling boil! <cf>There's going to be a good sound today!
<cf>Three Uribos each from the "Sea Rhythm Meadow" are killed. <cf> I hope this won't take too long.
Han!　I guess that's what you call a beat performer's shoulder. <cf>Let's get this over with!
<cf>We'll meet back here when we're done, okay? <cf>Thanks for the help, buddy!
Hey, man! <cf>Sounds like you're done, taking down Uribo!
That sounded good. <cf>You've got some real skill and taste!
Thanks to you, the request is complete. <cf>Han!　I'm proud to report that. Thank you!
<cf>After all these results, the image of beat performers should improve.
There are some hard-headed people out there. <cf>Han!　I think we can make them look up to us.
They always look at me with a scornful eye. <cf>Beat performers are in a class of their own!
Sorry about that ......! <cf>I've been bitching a lot. Just let it slide....
Anyway, I'm going to continue <cf>to work steadily as a beat performer.
Help me out if you feel like it. <cf>It was really nice working with you.
I'd love to have a session with you! <cf>See you around!　Thanks again!
The beat performer's profile is growing nicely. <cf>Han!　I feel like I'm getting a good reputation!
<cf>The young ones are fine, but the response from the old ones is still not so good.
Well, let's keep up the good work. <cf>Beat performers are the best, that's for sure!
Yo!　How's the beat-performer activity going? <cf>Have you got a good sound?
I'm not worried about you, though. <cf> You must be raising the stock of beat performers!
I think more people know about beat performers than <cf>before!
So, I found another commission <cf>that nobody wants to do. I've just taken it on!
It's a chance for beat performers to show off their skills! <cf>Let's see what you can do for us this time!
The client is a medicine man from Minsterhorn, and <cf>he wants me to gather ingredients for a potion and take out a monster.
Seems like a decent request, right? <cf>But the client, the apothecary, is a fickle fellow.
<cf>He's a very eccentric old man, and all the adventurers are shying away from him.
That's where we beat performers come in!
Leave it to me to deal with the old lady. <cf>I'm used to dealing with hard-headed people.
<cf>I'm used to dealing with hard-headed people, so if they say anything, just let it go and concentrate on your request.
<cf>Then let's start with Minsterhorn. <cf> Let's go see that bigoted bitch.
<cf>The client is a pharmacist in Minsterhorn, Mr. Baa. <cf>Let's go talk to him first.
I hear she's a bigoted bitch. <cf> Leave it to me. I'm used to people like that.
<cf>The hard-headed ones are the ones who nag and nag at beat performers.
<cf>Well, it has nothing to do with this request. <cf>Let's get the hell to Minsterhorn!
<cf> What's up, you guys? <cf>What do you want in this deserted apothecary?
A good young man should not rely on drugs. <cf> Eat and sleep!　You'll be cured most of the time.
No, no, no, I'm here at the request of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>You're looking for ingredients for medicine, right?　Baa-san.
Ah?　Are you adventurers? <cf> You're dressed up like a bunch of wackos.
<cf> We're beat performers. <cf> We're beat performers!
Well, I don't know what you youngsters are doing. <cf> Well, as long as you do your job, that's all that matters.
All right. So what can I bring?
<cf>"Kisuri Grass," "Cool Breeze Stone," and "Cane Shell. <cf> Find all three.
<cf>After that, we'll take down the skyfish. <cf>They're eating up all kinds of medicinal materials.
<cf>We have customers waiting for medicine, so let's get the material collection out of the way first.
If those instruments and weapons and whatnot <cf>aren't decorations, it won't take long.
You're a man of a few words, aren't you, old lady? <cf>You can't just ask for it.
It's a legitimate request, and I'm sure <cf>someone</cf> would have done it for you if you'd just asked nicely.
Hmm!　I don't want people who choose their requests based on their attitude.
If you don't like it, get out of here. <cf>Are beat performers that good?
Han!　You're so right! <cf>Beat performers don't have two words!
<cf>I'm not going to throw a request away once I've accepted it! <cf>Watch me, I'll get it done right!
<cf>First, let's gather the materials! <cf>First, we need to gather materials, three kinds, right?
<cf>There were three kinds of materials: "kisuri grass," "cool breeze stones," and "kammi shells. <cf>All of them can be found in Minster.
Kisuri Grass, Cool Breeze Stone, and Crested Shellfish. <cf>These three are the ingredients for the medicine.
You can find all of them in Minster. <cf>I'll have you take care of that first.
After that, I've asked you to take down the skyfish. <cf>Adventurers should be able to do that easily.
<cf>So show them that being a beat performer isn't all it seems.
I found the kissing plant.
I found the cool breeze stone.
I found the "Crested Shell".
Okay, you've gathered your materials! <cf>Thanks for your help!
<cf>Now that we've got the materials, we'll have to take down the skyfish next.
Damn, that old man is rough with people. <cf>No wonder adventurers don't come around here.
Well, we wouldn't throw out a <cf>request</cf> because of that!
Skyfish are in "Minster [Hills]. <cf>Taking them down isn't that hard, though.
<cf>I thought you said you had a customer waiting for medicine. <cf>I think he's going to complain if I don't deliver the materials first: ......
No wonder!　I'm going to run out and deliver the materials to <cf>Baa-san</cf>.
You go ahead and start killing them. <cf>I'll be right there.
<cf>I'll be there in a minute. <cf>Let's get this over with!
<cf>You go ahead and take down the Skyfish. <cf>It looks like I only need to take down three of them.
<cf>I'm going to deliver the ingredients for the medicine to Baa. <cf>After that, I'll come right over.
<cf>When I'm done, I'll go report back to Baa-san. <cf>Thank you for your help then!
<cf>Ola, Baa-san! <cf>I've done as you asked.
<cf>I gathered up the ingredients for the potion, and <cf>cleanly took down the skyfish. Can't complain, can you?
Hmmm, I heard some loud music. <cf>Do adventurers fight like that these days?
<cf>I guess the monsters won't be attracted to them if they make that much noise.
At least say thank you!
Well, never mind. <cf>Well, we're going home now.
Wait for us. The noisy one over there. <cf>You need your medicine, take it with you.
<cf> You're so proud of yourself, you can't even hear it through your skinned fingers.
<cf> Don't you dare mock my old lady. <cf>Take good care of your tools of the trade.
<cf>You quiet ones over there seem to be fine, but if you're not feeling well, just rest quietly.
I need you guys to stay healthy.
<cf>You're being so nice all of a sudden. <cf>You're out of shape.
The next time I have a request, I need an adventurer who is <cf>convenient</cf> to ask without hesitation.
Huh!　That's the reason?
You're a beat performer, right?　I'll keep that in mind. <cf>They're good-natured and meddlesome.
<cf>the kind of guys who get the job done, even when the bigoted old lady is being sarcastic.
<cf>Ah, I can't hear the strange music in my ears. <cf>I'll have to tell everyone in the village.
...... I wonder if that old lady, after all she said, <cf>recognizes us.
I think the music of the beat performers has <cf>some</cf> power!
Adventurers put their bodies on the line every day, don't they? <cf>Some of them get hurt or even die.
Everyone looks up to adventurers and relies on them, but <cf> it's not all fun and games.
That's why we need music in this world!
To light hope in everyone's hearts<cf> even when things get hard, scary, or painful.
Beat performers don't just fight. <cf>This class has the power to connect people with each other!
Some people still dismiss us out of hand,<cf>but times will change. We'll change it!
Han!　I'm talking out of my ass. <cf>I'd like to help you too, if you're willing!
Let's <cf> make the future of beat performers shine with our own hands!
Speaking of which, what kind of weapons do you use?
What kind of weapons are you using?　<cf>I want to choose the one that will make me feel like I'm in the right place at the right time!
Our sound depends on the weapon. <cf>Compatibility is also important!
Yo, I've been waiting for you!　<cf>We have to be more enthusiastic than usual for this request!
After all, this is a request for a beat performer!
Sometimes we get requests <cf> for individuals or classes.
But it's rare to get a request for a beat performer! <cf>Maybe we're getting better and better at this!
Oh?　Rumor has it that a client has arrived!
Hello, here! <cf> My name is Nadris, and I'm the client.
I'm Nadris, <cf>thank you very much for your help today!　Aww!
Hey, nice to meet you! <cf>Are you nervous, or what?
Well, I've never talked to a beat performer before. ......
Well, actually, I thought it looks a bit scary. ...... <cf>Because the music is so intense and loud.
Oh, I'm sorry!　I know it's rude for us to meet for the first time. <cf>I know you are a fine adventurer!
<cf>I can't keep saying I'm not good at it, <cf>Oh, I thought I'd take the plunge and ask you for a request!
I see. So you put out a <cf>request</cf> for a beat performer.
If you're not good at being a beat performer, <cf>I don't think it's a big deal.
I'd be more than happy if you liked me. <cf>Sometimes personal tastes and interests just don't mix.
No, no!　You know, the priest said that we shouldn't <cf>judge people based on appearances or assumptions!
No, it's okay!　From first impressions, neither of you are <cf>that scary</cf>!
Haha, that's good to hear! <cf>We'll take care of your request, so don't worry!
<cf>I'm sure we'll get the job done right. This time, we need your help with a survey of <cf>plants in the Andorra Basin</cf>.
There is a goblin habitat there, and it is too dangerous for investigators like <cf>us</cf> alone. ......
First of all, could you <cf>escort us to the garrison of the Buffalia cult?
OK. <cf>Let me hear the details when we get there.
OK, let's go!　First, let's go to the <cf>garrison in the Andorra Basin.
First, we'll escort Nadris to the <cf>Andorra Basin.
The garrison of the Buffarian cult is just right. <cf>Let's go there.
<cf>We'll go there and they'll tell us all the details. <cf>Well then, let's get fired up!
Hey, good job! <cf>It looks like you got there safely.
Thank you very much. <cf>Well then, let's begin our investigation.
As I told you before we left, <cf>there is a goblin settlement in the "Andorra Basin".
The plants we want to collect for our survey <cf>are growing in the vicinity. ......
So we're just going to have to kick the goblins' asses?
No, I don't think it would be possible to defeat them all. <cf> I was hoping you could distract them while we drive them away.
In that sense, I was just thinking that the beat performers' <cf>music</cf> might be effective!
Ah, I see!　If we play loudly, the goblins will be attracted to us.
And Nadris can collect them while we're at it. <cf>She's smart!
Oh, really?　I get embarrassed when people praise me. <cf> Heh, heh, heh.
I'll try not to stand out, so <cf>you two should rather stand out!
Han!　Leave it to me!　When it comes to standing out, <cf>no one can match a beat performer!
Alright, let's go out with a bang and take down some goblins!　Let's go out with a bang and take down some goblins! <cf> I think our goal is to take out 5 each.
When you're done, we'll meet up here. <cf> Come on, let's get crackin'!
Let's take down the goblins in the Andorra Basin. <cf>It looks like we should take out 5 each.
<cf>We've got to get their attention so they don't go for Nadris!
<cf>We're beat performers at our best when it comes to standing out! <cf>Let's get loud and rowdy!
Alright, we've got a goblin slaying to do!　Goblins down, done!
<cf>Your sound was very noticeable! <cf> That's something the goblins won't be able to ignore.
Han!　I was really into it, too. <cf>I couldn't match that sound!
Thank you both!
Thanks to you, we were able to get the plants we wanted. <cf> And the goblins didn't notice us at all.
I'm glad we asked the beat performers to help us!
Han!　Have you <cf>reviewed the beat performers a little?
Yes, I did!　Of course I did!
I'm a dullard and tone-deaf, <cf>I'm not good at playing an instrument or anything at all. ......
So I thought it was really cool to see beat performers <cf>fighting</cf> while playing music!
Plus, hearing the music made me feel safe knowing that the beat performers were <cf>with me!
I was a little scared of the loud sound, but <cf>I realized that it was really a very reliable sound!
That sound is a sign that the beat performers are <cf> working hard for everyone!
Han!　When you say it like that, <cf>I don't feel bad about it.
Come on, come on!　The job is done. <cf>Go back and report, report!
Ah, yes. <cf> Well, the original client was the Order of Buffalia.
So we have to go to the temple in Asterlys. <cf> Um, may I ask you to follow me?
Ugh, the Temple of Buffalia. ......
No, it's nothing. It's a client's request. <cf>I'll follow you to the temple or wherever.
That's why. <cf>I'll give Nadris a lift to the temple of Asterlys.
<cf> I guess Nadris's request has to be reported to the temple of Asterlys.
I don't want to get too close to it. ...... <cf>The client asked for it.
Let's give Nadris a ride to the temple.
Okay, we're here. <cf>As usual, it's a restless place.
<cf>When we're done here, let's get the hell out of here. <cf>There's a lot of trouble here.
Yeah, I guess so. I might want to go home soon too. ......
Ah, but!　Before I do that, let me <cf>reiterate</cf> thank you both properly!
Thank you so much. <cf>The investigation of our objective went smoothly, and
I've become a complete fan of <cf>beat performers after this request!
Han!　You say such nice things about me! <cf>This is the first time anyone has ever called me a fan!
Really?　Then I guess I'm fan #1!
NADRIS!　What are you doing in a place like that?
Kyah!　Oh, father!
You were with the adventurer again, calling it a request. <cf> I always tell you to choose who you go out with!
What's more. You're a beat performer, aren't you? <cf>Taking along with the crappy ones, you are pathetic!
<cf>Don't be a student all the time, <cf>and try to do your duty in the temple!
Oh, I'm sorry. ......
Hey, old man! <cf>Don't come out of nowhere and talk smack!
Nadris has been taking care of the Order's requests. <cf>I don't have anything to complain about!
<cf> Look at that. You open your mouth and you're classless. <cf>Beat performers are like that.
<cf>The frivolous ones who just want to be pampered and admired for their music should stay away from my daughter!
<cf>The God of Buffalia is watching. <cf>At best, don't be a nuisance to others.
No, no, father!
You come quickly, Nadris! <cf>I will not allow you to go near these people!
<cf> You're a bunch of fools!　All these priests are so selfish!
That's why I didn't want to go near this place!
Damn ....... I just lost my temper. <cf>That's not the kind of thing that should hit you. I'm sorry.
Han, things are getting a little tense, so let's call it a night.
Thanks for helping me out. <cf>Next time, come hang out with me. Bye.
I think more and more people <cf>understand</cf> the beat performers.
But the hard-headed ones and the like <cf>still complain about it sometimes.
Ahhhhhh, it's a blur! <cf>But talking back won't change anything.
Hey, I've been waiting for you. <cf>We've got another request, so let's do it together.
Hm?　You're not very excited, are you? <cf>Well, the client this time is a bit different: ......
It's a request from the Order of Buffalia.
<cf>Well, the client this time is from the Buffalia cult, not by name. <cf>I could have just gone through with it.
You see, there was Nadris, who was with us on the previous request. <cf>The one who said she wasn't good at beat performers.
<cf>She did a good job with the request, even though she wasn't good with beat performers, and in the end she understood.
<cf>That made me think that I shouldn't be stingy and say that I don't like the cult.
So, I dared to accept the request from the temple.
What? <cf>I know it's nothing to sneeze at!
But if I keep looking like a douche on ......, I'll embarrass you too!
And anyway!　That's why I'm asking for your help! <cf>I'll go to the Temple of Asterlys to hear about your request!
Don't smile, let's get the hell out of here!　Come on!
<cf>I think I did the uncharacteristic thing of choosing a request from the cult.
But it's not like I'm going to be bad at this forever,<cf> I don't want to be bad at this, and I don't want to be bad at this!
Just go to the temple and listen to what they have to say! <cf> Oh, for heaven's sake, let's get this over with!
You guys are the beat performers involved with Nadris! <cf>You didn't tell me you took a commission from the Temple, did you?
I told you!　Don't bother people!
We were just doing what we were asked to do. <cf> We're not bothering anyone!
<cf>I'm just saying that it's a nuisance for you and your ilk to come to the temple!
<span size="Big">Well, you know what, ......? </>
(Ugh ......!　No, patience, patience. <cf>Stay with me, I'll stay with you.)
Well, well, don't say that. <cf>Well, don't say that. Let them give it a try.
<cf>We're registered adventurers with the Pioneer Bureau, too. <cf>We'll take our requests seriously, so don't worry.
<cf>We won't be fooled by your pretense of being so auspicious! <cf>Most likely, his intention this time is to get close to my daughter again.
<cf> You're using my request as an excuse to play tricks on my daughter. <cf>That's what makes him untrustworthy!
(Google ......!　...... No, no, no. <cf>If you start a fight here, it'll be the same as always.)
<cf>I know what you're going to say. <cf>Let me talk about the request. I'll leave after I hear it.
<cf> What's with that stupid outfit? <cf>You're flaunting your flirty clothes!
<cf>A beat performer with a sloppy outfit could commit a crime at any time!
<span size="Big">Shut the fuck up, old man! </>
I told you to tell me what you're asking for! <cf>We didn't come here to listen to a sermon!
You're making too much noise. What are you doing?
Gim-sama!　Why are you here?
[--] Tramon. How is the duty I ordered you to perform? <cf> I see you have not received my report.
...... I was giving advice to a young man of bad behavior. <cf>Sorry about that. I will get right on it.
As for the request, I will leave it to Nadris. <cf>Go to Ralparu and ask him about it.
A young man of bad behavior, huh? <cf>Glenn, what do you have to say for yourself?
......han, nothing. <cf>We're just here on business.
Let's go, buddy. <cf>Nadris is in Ralparu.
Try not to cause too much trouble, Glenn.
Han, I don't know. <cf> You guys are just making a scene on your own.
<cf> I've seen the look on your face. <cf> He's the one who had nothing to do with this.
It's nothing, don't worry about it. <cf>Let's just get this over with.
<cf>Nadris is in Larpall, isn't he? <cf>Let's get the hell out of here and hear what he has to say.
Oh, Mr. Glenn and the adventurer! <cf>You took care of the request.
Good. I wasn't sure who would be there. <cf>I'm sure the two of you will be fine.
Ah, well, thanks again. NADRIS.
So, what are we supposed to do? <cf> Tell me that as soon as you can.
......?　Uh, yes. I understand.
I'm asking for advice from the folks at Ralpar this time. <cf>They say that there is eating damage to building envelopes, fences, etc.
Apparently, some of the building materials were made of something that horngoats <cf>love</cf> to eat.
So, it was decided to examine the contents of the horngoat's stomach to <cf>identify the relevant plants</cf>.
If we can avoid the building materials that horngoats like, we should be able to <cf>prevent the feeding damage!
I would like you two to take down about <cf>5 horngoats for research purposes.
I will go with you and collect the food that the horngoths ate.
Our job is not difficult, but <cf>Nadris's must be a lot of work.
I think it's rather tough to examine the contents of their stomachs.
Haha ......, yes. <cf>No one wanted to do it willingly.
But someone has to do it. <cf>I figured if others didn't want to do it, I'd do my best.
For fathers, ["]daughters around your age! ["]] and <cf>I'm sure he's going to give me some more grief.
I see. ....... I guess so. It takes guts to be <cf> willing to do things that people don't like.
Oh, that ...... Mr. Glenn, you are not well. <cf>Maybe something about our dad ......?
No, it's not Nadris' dad's fault.
I'm talking about my family. <cf>There's a guy in my family who's a pain in the ass too.
And he's a priest in Buffalia, too. <cf>He's a loudmouth, or he's talking from above. ......
Han!　<cf> I'm not going to talk about this! <cf>I'm starting to feel sorry for myself.
I thought we killed 5 Horngoats. <cf>The ones at the Hill of God's Watchful Eye, right?
Okay, this should be quick and easy! <cf>Let's get this over with!
<cf>Let's take down five Horngoats in the Hill of God's Watchful Eye!
Nadris is going to retrieve the stomach contents. <cf>He wants us to concentrate on taking them down.
It's not much work, but Nadris is here, so we've got to keep our heads in the game.
<cf>We'll come back here when we're done. <cf>So, let's get started!
Han!　Good job, guys! <cf>You sounded good again this time!
Thank you very much. <cf>We were also able to collect what the Horngoats ate!
I'm going to go back to Asterlys now to <cf>examine it in more detail with the Buffalian cult!
Oh, and we're going to report back to the Temple. <cf>So, I'll send you on your way.
I hope my dad doesn't find me again and <cf>gasp!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My dad is a little too protective of me.
He worries if I even go out for a minute, and he's against field trips like this one.
Lately, he's been telling me not to listen to frivolous things, <cf>even talking about the music I'm listening to. ......
I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I'm in a similar situation.
We've been Buffalian priests for generations, <cf>and we were the conservative ones.
We didn't accept anything but traditional music, <cf>and we didn't like beat performers.
With my brother rising to the rank of second priest, <cf>I was even more of a family snob.
Why are you so obsessed with being a beat performer, Glenn?
Probably for the same reason as Nadris.
I like it and believe it's <cf>right</cf>, no matter how much I'm opposed to it.
Beat performers will always have the power that only beat performers <cf>have.
I just want everyone to know that. <cf>Beat Performers are not to be left behind!
......Yes, that's true. What I do is also simple, but <cf>I believe it's necessary for someone.
I hope your father understands that. ......
Han!　Nadris will be fine! <cf>I'm doing my best for everyone!
Come on, let's go report the request! <cf>If your dad is around, we'll tell him too!
Haha, thank you very much. <cf>Then let's go back to the temple in Asterlys!
Now that Nadris' request is done, <cf>let's go back to the temple of Asterlys.
We need to give them a big "We've done our job!
Well, we're here!　Let's get this over with.
Your dad's at ......
Thank goodness he's not here. <cf>I'll go report the request while I'm at it.
Oh, you must be ....... You must be Nadris. <cf> I seem to recall you requesting a job from the temple.
Ah, Mr. Second Priest! <cf>My father is always at your service!
Geez!　Why are you coming out here?
Mr. Glenn?　Oh, could it be that ......<cf> Mr. Gim is Mr. Glenn's brother?
I've heard about you from Treymon. <cf>Thanks for the report on the request. Mr. Nadris.
Your family will be worried if you are late. <cf>That's it for today, go home.
Um, ...... yes. Now if you'll excuse me. <cf>Mr. Glenn, adventurer. See you.
We haven't seen each other for a while, Glenn. <cf>Are you performing your duties diligently?
Shut up. You're not bothering my brother.
Hey, Mr. Adventurer. Glenn is taking care of you. <cf>Has my brother been involved in anything nefarious?
No, he's not! <cf>What the hell, you're prying into my friend's affairs!
Beat performers are great adventurers! <cf>There's nothing to get your panties in a bunch about!
<cf>I don't mean to pick on the beat performers. <cf>But I have to question your attitude.
<cf>The new incarnation of the beat performers is unacceptable to those of us who are more conservative in our views, like my family.
Some, but not all, of the Order are of that opinion. <cf>Glenn, you are aware of that.
But you will still continue to be a <cf>beat performer</cf>, right?
Yeah, I'm not going to stop, no matter what you say! <cf>I'll even get my brother to recognize me!
<cf>You're still talking like that? <cf>You can't help it.
<cf>You'll never change the way he looks at you with such a narrow view of things!
...... Sorry, I've shown you the shame of my people.
I did what you asked me to do, and I owe you nothing but thanks. <cf>If you want, you can come back for the next one.
Because I'm pissed off about something. I'm going to pick the next one and make sure I get it done!
Han!　I can't end this without being told off! <cf>I'm going to shut you and everyone else up with the results!
<cf>I'll be ready again, so please give me a call! <cf>Thank you!
Han!　I've been waiting for you! <cf>I just got a big request!
The Order of Buffalia has asked us to escort a pilgrimage group and kill some monsters.
<cf>It seems that monsters appear near the pilgrims' route. <cf>They want us to escort them and, if possible, take out the monsters.
<cf>They can't say for sure what will appear, but <cf>with your help, we'll be fine!
My brother and <cf>Nadris's father</cf> are also participating in the pilgrimage group.
<cf>Nadris said he's going with us. <cf>He's also going to do some research on plants and stuff along the way.
Actually, it was Nadris who introduced me to the request.
When he heard that the Order was looking for adventurers, <cf>he recommended us</cf>.
<cf>The reason we were given such a big commission may be because of the reputation we've built as beat performers.
<cf>We'd like to thank you again for all your help. <cf>Thank you again!
<cf>This is also a chance for me to appeal directly to my brother, Nadris' father, and the Order!
<cf>So, first we'll meet up with the pilgrims in Larpal. <cf>Han!　Let's get fired up!
It's a big request from the Order of Buffalia. <cf>This is a great chance to show off our beat performance!
My brother and Nadris' dad will be there, so let's <cf>show them what we can do!
First, we'll meet up with the pilgrims in Larpal. <cf>Now, let's get this over with!
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme!　Are you all right!
Gghh ......!
<cf>No, I'm fine, it's no big deal. <cf>I'll have to call someone quicker than that. ......
Nadris!　And my brother!　What's wrong?
Oh, hey!　Brother! <cf> What the hell is that hurt?
Mr. Glenn!　And the adventurer! <cf> Well, that, mo, monster is ......!
On the way here, the pilgrims were attacked by a 'flame horn'!
Mr. Gim led the way and <cf>we were able to escape this far. ......
My wounds are nothing serious. <cf>I'm more worried about those who got separated in the attack.
Especially Treymon, who fled in the opposite direction of the village. <cf>I must head out to search for them immediately: ......!
Nadris' father!
Well, well, actually,...... yes!
I understand. Let's go get him right away.
Wait, Glenn!　The "Flame Horn" is a dangerous monster. <cf> And you hate Tramon.
So does Traymon. Just <cf>being a beat performer makes you look bad ......
<span size="Big">What the hell do you care! </>
I don't <cf>like</cf> old man Tramon, that's for sure. But it doesn't matter now!
If he's in trouble, I'll go help him! <cf>I'm an adventurer and a beat performer!
If they don't like it, so be it. <cf>If they don't like it, that's fine, we can bicker about it when we get back alive!
Glenn......
I'll bring your dad back soon. <cf>Wait and see, Nadris.
Ha, yes! <cf>Please take care of your dad!
Okay, let's go!　Buddy! <cf>There must be an old man somewhere in "God's Watch Hill"!
<cf>Tramon will be hiding somewhere in the "God's Watch Hill"!
There are "Flame Horns" and other monsters around. <cf>I hope you can rescue him as soon as possible!
But that little asker, Glenn, <cf>would willingly work for someone he doesn't like. ......
I may have to change my mind.
Hey, old Treymon! <cf> You're alive!
Hey, what the heck!　I thought help was on the way, but it's you guys!
You think you're doing me a favor? <cf> Not everything goes as planned!
<cf> If you can talk so poorly, that's good enough for me. <cf>Have you twisted your leg?　Let me see.
<cf> Don't touch it! <cf> I don't take care of beat performers!
<cf>Nothing good happens when you get involved with beat performers. <cf>My daughter won't listen to me, and neither will Master Gim.
What's your brother got to do with it?　What's it to you?
What are you playing at? <cf>You must have put Master Gim in charge.
Master Gim has spoken out on occasion in defense of adventurers, especially beat performers.
Perhaps because of this, even among conservatives, the beat performers <cf>are becoming more and more popular</cf>.
The reason why I entrusted the beat performers with this request is because <cf>Master Gim's will was at work.
That brother? <cf>I've never heard a word about that.
All he does to me is lecture me about how I need to change my attitude.
[<cf>Not now, I don't care about my brother. <cf>We've got to do something about the old man.
Let him go!　I don't appreciate beat performers even if I helped them!
If you don't like me, fine, but don't worry about <cf>Nadris</cf>.
Just because you don't like beat performers doesn't mean you should bother your <cf>daughter</cf>.
Gnnnnn ......
I don't care if the old man doesn't like it or complains, I'm taking him home. <cf>It's not for us, it's a promise to Nadris.
I don't think old man Tramon can walk. <cf> Then we'll have to do something about the "flame horns.
If we run into a "flaming horn" while carrying an old man who can't move, we'll be in over our heads.
All right!　First of all, we need to defeat the "Flame Horn" and secure our safety. <cf>Then we'll take old man Tramon with us.
So, old man!　We're going to go, so <cf>stay here and be quiet!
...... "Flame Horn" is at the "Hill of God's Watchful Eye". <cf>Go ahead, if you can!
<cf>I will listen to you a little if you really want to take them down!
Han!　Don't look so serious! <cf>Well then, let's get going!
<cf>The Flame Horns have the Hill of God's Watchful Eye as their territory. <cf>I'm sure we can find him.
<cf>I will stay here as I was told. <cf>I'll only slow you down.
...... If you have indeed defeated the Flaming Horn, <cf>then I will listen to you a little.
Oh, no, it's the Flame Horn.
Sorry. I didn't think I'd have to deal with such a nuisance.
I guess I used to be a beat performer and would have made a big deal out of it.
But now I'm not in the mood. <cf>I think you have to fight regardless.
My brother, Nadris, and the rest of the people who <cf>believe</cf> in us are out there.
And it would be a true beat performer's duty to answer them.
All right! <cf> Let's really make our sound resonate!
Let's go, "Flame Horn"!　Prepare yourselves!
Han!　We did it!
Now the pilgrims can relax. <cf> The monsters around us will be a little quieter now.
Oh, man, I would have been in trouble if I was alone. <cf>Thanks for your help!
<cf>I feel a little more confident now that I know I can fight against the Flame Horns.
Oops, this is not the time to talk. <cf>I was still in the middle of my request!
Let's go back to the old man Tramon for now. <cf>We've got to get him to Larpal.
Let's go back to old man Tramon. <cf>We can't leave him there alone.
<cf>I just hope he listens to us this time.
Hey, old man! <cf>I've killed the Flame Horns!
Is your leg okay? <cf> Then let's get the hell out of here and get to Larpal.
I can't believe that beat performers like you <cf> killed that "Flame Horn" ......
Han!　That was a piece of cake, man!
...... is an exaggeration. Because we both fought it.
Wasn't it <cf>Buffalian teaching to join hands in times of trouble?
The old man's hurt and can't walk, so <cf>you can count on us now.
......Yes, let's do that. <cf>It's me who doesn't understand God's teachings.
<cf>Take me to Larpal. <cf>I must report to Master Gim and Nadris that you are safe.
I'll ask the two adventurers to give you my regards.
Han!　It's no trouble. Leave it to me.
Come on, let's get back to Larpal! <cf> Well, we can go home feeling refreshed!
Let's take old Tramon back to Larpal!
Now that we've defeated the Flame Horns, we can go home refreshed!
I'll have a good report for my brother and Nadris. <cf> Han!　I feel great!
Hey, Glenn, adventurer!　You're safe!
Dad, thank goodness ......!　We were worried about you.
We're so sorry for the trouble you've been going through, Master Gim. <cf>Thank you for protecting my daughter!
<cf>I, too, was able to return with the help of the two beat performers!
<cf> I thank the gods of Buffalia for their blessings, and <cf> for all your hard work!
Oh, well. That was a disaster.
I am also injured. <cf>You and Nadris should rest for the time being.
Let's go, father.
Nadris. I once held an instrument in my hand. <cf>I longed to be a musician at the Star Festival.
There were times when I neglected my duties and spent all day practicing music.
What?　Oh, your father?
But I lacked the talent, the will to do my own thing, and the desire to play for someone else.
I guess I was selfishly jealous of you and other beat performers.
<cf>You have awakened me to this. <cf>I think music has great power
Especially the music played by ...... beat performers can<cf> give a strong push to people!
You and I both need to learn from them. <cf> Let's have a little chat over there.
Uh-huh.
Um, well, we'll be right here. <cf> Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
I've never heard Tramon talk like that before. <cf>Maybe he had a change of heart or something.
Glenn. And Mister Adventurer. <cf>You did a great job, including defeating the "Flame Horns".
Especially, Glenn. You are no longer the little brother I imagined you to be.
Han, you are the older brother. <cf>You weren't a hard-nosed know-it-all.
You were protecting the beat performers in many ways. <cf> You're so watery that you didn't say anything.
From now on, you can proudly take my side. <cf>...... brothers, right?
I never thought I'd hear those words from your mouth.
Mister Adventurer. I would like to thank you once again. <cf>Thank you for supporting my brother.
Because of you, people will <cf>look at beat performers<cf> a whole lot differently!
Han!　Absolutely, man! <cf>You've shown us what a beat performer can do.
You're a great guy! <cf>I couldn't be happier to be your friend!
Keep up the good work! <cf>Let's make our sound echo around the world!
Hey there!　Are you making a good sound today?
I'm trying my hand at all kinds of requests. <cf>Han!　It's fun and worthwhile!
My brother, Nadris, and old man Tramon <cf>sometimes send me requests, too!
When we get a chance, we'll do it together again! <cf>I'm looking forward to this session with you!
Hey, man. <cf>Would you do me a favor?
It's an easy job. <cf>I just need you to go for a run and deliver something.
...... Is that <span size="Big">something bad</span>?
Kukuk......Yes, it's a <span size="Big">big bad product</span>!
Once you get a taste of it, there's no going back ......
......!
It's the famous Salaamzat, a super spicy spice! <cf>You'll get sick to your nose just smelling it.
I thought it was <span size="Big">that thing</span>!
Well, well, <span size="Big">"that thing"</span>another time!
......!
There's a lady who recently moved here from Salamzat, and <cf>she can't get this spice here</cf>.
But fortunately, my supplier carries it. <cf>They just got it in.
Freshness is essential, so I'd like to get it to you right away. ......<cf>I've got some cooking to do too.
<cf>I'll give you free lodging if you deliver it to me.
Oh?　You wanted to see me?
<cf> The owner of Coin-tei asked me to deliver this to you. <cf> He asked me to deliver this to you.
Oh, ...... this!　I wanted this spice. <cf>With this, I can recreate the taste of my hometown. <cf>I'm so glad!
I heard it's pretty spicy. ......
Is that so? <cf>It's normal in Salamzat?
...... that's right!　Come and try it sometime if you like. <cf>I'll treat you for delivering it to me.
Wow, really?　Thank you!
And by the way, that's a great Asterlys. <cf>What the heck, I get what I want.
I've never even seen a subhuman of your type before. <cf>Where are you from?
Ah ......
Uh ...... not Asterlys, I guess. ......
Oh, we have to go back to the pavilion. <cf>Then, treat me when you get a chance!
What?　Yes, I will. Looking forward to it. <cf>Will you bring your husband with you when you do?
Oh, you delivered. Good job.
The client lady is going to treat us to a dish using that spice.
[She said that her husband will be with her at that time, <cf> but ......
<cf>I'm not going to do anything else, I've got enough on my mind. <cf> I'm fine with just my feelings, yeah.
......?　What's up, Feste? <cf> You look kind of delicate.
Is that so?　Well,...... I'm going upstairs to rest a bit. <cf>Don't wake me up unnecessarily.
...... What's with that guy? What's wrong with him?
<cf>I'm sure he's your master, isn't he? <cf>Go check on him.
What? I told you not to wake him up unnecessarily.
He was acting strange, I was worried.
...... I just remembered something.
<cf> I just remembered what the lady said, didn't I? <cf>I've never seen a subhuman like me before.
I've been here for a long time. <cf>I've been told that less and less often. ......
...... I, too, have never seen the same species as myself.
I have met many different subhumans. <cf>But none of them looked like me.
I have no memory of ...... the past, and I have no kindred. <cf>I've been thinking about that for a while now.
Well, as long as I have enough money to live on, <cf>I don't really care!　Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yes, yes.
Well, that's my servant. You know what you're talking about!
But I ......<cf> want your memory back too!
But I want ......<cf> your memory back too!
[--]!
What, what, don't look so strangely serious. <cf>You're embarrassing me!
Now, you must go. <cf>Your husband told you to go and check on him, didn't he?
<cf>After a short rest, I'll go downstairs too. <cf>I'm hungry!
Hey, how was Feste?
Well, ......
She said, ["]A good woman doesn't need a past! ["]] or <cf>something like that, but he does get a lonely look in his eyes from time to time.
I think it was about ......4 years ago. <cf> Feste was lying outside the city, hungry.
He had no memory of it, and he looked like a wreck. ...... <cf>So I kind of picked him up.
Back then I was fooled too. <cf>I was kind enough to feed him and give him a place to stay. ......
<cf>And then, I was totally taken in. <cf>Hey, you brought trouble and trouble without reservation!
<cf>I'm going to have to make sure they pay me for four years of lodging and trouble!
...... Well, it's better that you're excited about <cf>making money than that you're depressed, isn't it?
And Feste, I hope you get your memory back soon too.
Hey, give me something to eat! <cf> I'm starving after a little rest!
Ah, the noisy one's coming down. <cf>No choice, I'll make it on the tab!
Meow!
Oh, you're that guy's ....... <cf> I didn't expect to see you here. Hmm?
Meow?　Meow!
M...... that's how it is. ......
<cf> I'm sorry to disturb you, servant, but I have to work now. <cf>Will you take no for an answer?
Well, I'll need you to get me about 10 pieces of meat from ......<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/>.
What?　Why?
We silently obey what the Lord tells us to do! <cf>That's what a servant does!
Is that clear?　When you get what you want, give it to this cat. Then it will reach him.
Hmmm!
Well, then, take this to him. <cf>No need to thank me.
It is the duty of the master to provide for his servant!
--Hmmm?
...... hmm?　What is it? <cf>What's that on my face?
Now, a servant is ......
Kukuku...... thought you and Tirith were the only servants? <cf>Sweet!　You are indeed sweet!
What do you know of me, my lord!
I am the most beautiful girl forever!
<cf> What, you know what I'm talking about. <cf>hehehe...... hehehe....... I'm so embarrassed. ......
Well, well, I have <cf>many</cf> servants besides you. Do you think I have the talent to follow them?
Hmmm?　What, are you jealous? <cf> You want me all to yourself?　Hmmm~?
Hmmm...
Oh, no. It's fresh meat. <cf> I'll have to get it to my servant as soon as possible.
I'll go with you. It's been a while since I've seen his face.
<cf>Never mind, he'll be back soon. <cf>So don't look so sad. Hmmm...
It's hard to be the master of a popular girl~!
Meow, meow!
Long time no see, servant #5. <cf>Is this girl ...... yours?
N~......
<cf>He's a fine husband to come begging for food on behalf of his wife!
I'll be right back!
Go ahead, eat your fill. <cf> For the sake of your children's milk.
Oh, meow!
Will you listen to me? <cf> I have a human servant now.
<cf>Both of you are dangerous. <cf>And they're lonely, so I have to get them back soon.
Oh, no!
Don't worry. I'll take good care of you and the others, okay? <cf> For I am the master.
This is ...... servant No. 8. Grow up big, will you?
Meow~!
<cf> I'll take good care of him. <cf>You all must be without me.
Well, I'd better get back. <cf>Before the servants I left behind cry out in loneliness.
<cf>You too can always count on me. <cf>It is the Lord's duty to protect his servants!
Hey, you two!　<cf>Good timing, you were in the right place at the right time!
What is it, out of the blue?
Actually, I have a favor to ask.
<cf>You're not here, so let's go somewhere else. <cf>Yeah,...... wait for me on the top floor of this building.
[--]You're a real pain in the ass, aren't you? <cf>Well, ......, I'll do you the favor.
Thanks for waiting!
I've been waiting. <cf> So, what's the favor?
I'm sorry, could you please go to Minsterhorn? <cf> I need you to give this letter to the priest there.
What? <cf> You can go yourself.
I'd like that too. <cf>But right now I'm busy gathering information on Abertia.
We can't just leave something that could be a danger to Asterlys, <cf>can we?
[--]So, please. <cf>This is something only you can do, because you're the one I've got my eye on!
I understand.
<cf>Thank you!
...... Yeah, I'm sure you'll be fine, but <cf>don't read the letter, okay?
Okay?　I'm only asking because it's you. <cf> Don't ever look at it, okay?　Really, don't look, okay?
You're persistent. <cf> Don't worry, I'm with you!
No, I'm more worried because <cf>you're with me. ......
All right, my servant. <cf>I'll read the letter aloud to you right here and now...
Stop, I trust you! <cf>You and your daughter are both trustworthy people!
Hmm, well, good. <cf> In exchange, I'll get a bullet in your reward, right?
Yes, of course. <cf> I'll pay you what you want!
All right, all right. That's top of the line. <cf>We'll be counting on you.
But the priest in Minsterhorn. <cf> I never thought I'd see a man who talks like that again. ......
Oh, you guys are ....... What's the matter? <cf> You've come to ask about the [visitors] again?
That's fine. Let's talk as much as you want. <cf>Last time, as I recall, we even talked about the "Mihashira" of "Kamigakari.
Now, let's talk about the origin of the Mihashira. <cf>We will talk about who made that thing in the first place[--].
<cf> Wait a minute!　Not this time! <cf>We are here on Jake's errand!
What?　Jake's? <cf>...... Oh, I see.
I thought you guys had found <cf>interest</cf> in this journey of exploration called history. ......
Sorry. Anyway, this time Jake asked me to do something for you. <cf>He asked me to give you this letter.
Hmmm. It is indeed addressed to me. Oh, this is ......
What is it?　What does it say? <cf> Can't you at least tell me a little bit?
Hmmm, yes, ....... <cf>Maybe you should ask him.
<cf>Whenever I see the rain falling in Asterlys, <cf>I think of you.
<cf> Are they tears of sorrow or tears of joy? <cf>I hope both of them are for me.
...... it is ......
What do you think?
What do you think of it? <span size="Big">Isn't it a <span size="Big">complete love letter</span> ......!
Huh?　That?　Jake?　For you? <cf>Wait, wait, wait, wait!　You're not making a mistake!
It is not a mistake. Me and Jake have exchanged <cf> these sentences many times!
Eh?　What? <cf>Wait a minute, I'm a little confused.
Well, I mean, you and Jake have <cf>been writing love letters back and forth</cf>. ......?
Many times?
Many times.
...... Mm, I get it. I understand. <cf>Something like that, yes!
Well, my servant. Now that the letter is safely delivered, <cf>we shall return to report.
But Jake thought <cf>Murie was the one he was after,<cf> but you never know what people have in mind,</cf> ......
Oh, please wait. <cf>I'm going to write a reply to Jake.
I'll just do a quick ...... Yes, I've got it. <cf>Then please give this to Jake.
Next time you come back, we can talk about [Mihashira]. <cf>No, I think now would be better. What is the "Mihashira" in the first place [--]?
<cf>Well, then, we'll leave you to it. <cf>The love letter is better when it's fresh!
Oh, your tone sounds like Jake, doesn't it? <cf>...... are you close?
Not at all!　Not at all!　<span size="Big">Not one bit! </>
So don't <span size="Big">be jealous</span>!
Ha-ha-ha, jealousy. <cf>I have no such feelings!
You mean you don't have any teeth for us. ...... <cf>You and Jake seem to have a very good relationship.
...... I wonder what it is. It's like <cf> having a relative grow up without you even knowing it. ......
Now, let's get this letter to Jake. <cf> For a bright future for both of us!
Thanks for waiting! <cf>Did you give him the letter?
<cf>Here, Priest. <cf>Here is the priest's reply. Read it with all your heart.
Yeah! I knew you guys would do it. <cf> That priest was a long story, wasn't he?
You ...... are not the kind of person to <cf>say that about someone you miss so much, are you?
......?　Anyway, I've got to give him his reward.
Oops, I forgot it in the warehouse. I left it in the warehouse. <cf>...... sorry. Wait here.
Wasn't that Jake just now? <cf>It's unusual for him to be here.
[What are you doing here?
It's time for a break. <cf>I like the view from here.
I see. ....... <cf>So, you're in good company.
......?　What?
Jake. He's got a girlfriend.
You know, ......
You said before that you were having trouble saying no <cf>.　Well, I guess that problem is solved now.
...... Well, that's good to know. Well, that's good.
Hey, sorry about that!　Sorry about the wait!
Oh, I see Jake is back. <cf> Well, I'll be off then.
I just passed Muley...<cf>What's up?
He said he likes the view from here.
Wow! I guess he is a romantic after all!
...... and here's your reward. <cf>Don't tell me it's not enough.
<cf>Well, that's okay, I'll give you a break. <cf> Well, it's okay, you got to meet your lover.
Sweetheart?　Oh, come on, you're getting ahead of yourself. <cf>Well, I'm pretty sure that's going to happen with her.
With this love letter, she'll find me attractive. <cf>It's worth it, I've been taught!
Taught ......?
Oh!　I asked that priest to <cf>correct my Love Letter, and today I finally got a passing grade!
Now I'm going to get her heart!
Ah ...... ah, that kind of ....... Wow ......
Now, I'm going to go and clean up the letter. <cf>I'll put my heart and soul into it!
Mm, good luck. I wish you good luck.
...... Don't say anything, servant. <cf>We didn't say anything to her. Okay?
<span size="Big">Two-Timing, you stupid bastard! </>
Just a moment!　I'm sure I'm supposed to pass ......
You get an unqualified failing grade, enemy of women!
Hey, hey, wait! ......
Fuu......
Hmm? <cf>...... what are you guys doing here?
Wherever you are, you're on your own.
<cf>Why do you look so difficult? <cf>Did you fail to cook?
That kind of thing happens every day.
No, you can't reopen that one.
...... these guys can handle it.
Let me make a request. <cf>I want you to give this guy to an adventurer in Larpal.
Originally, I was going to ask someone else. <cf> Apparently he couldn't come.
Letter ......?　Is that <span size="Big">something bad</span>?
...... Yeah, it's a pretty <span size="Big">dangerous item</span>!
Once you know what's in this guy, there's no turning back. <cf>That's the kind of thing.
What's the matter? It's different and more powerful than usual.
Oh, ......, you may be in some danger. <cf>Will you still take the case?
I'll take care of it.
<cf>I'll take you up on it. <cf>I'll make sure I thank you properly.
Just say 'from the other side of the coin' to the person you're giving it to. <cf>That should get it through.
Oh, ......, what's so secretive about it?
Do not pry into it at all. <cf>I'll tell you the details once I've successfully completed the request.
Hmmm......... Well, if you can thank me, that's good. <cf>And since you and I are on good terms...
Sorry. <cf> Oh, and just so you know, don't read the letter, okay?
Well, it's sealed in wax, so there's no way you can <cf>see it.
<cf> Don't underestimate us. <cf>It is the pride of an adventurer to keep his hands off the commissioned goods.
<cf>When you're done, come to the dock at the port. <cf>We'll talk there.
The wharf? <cf>Why such a place ......
No need to pry.
No use, you know. <cf>...... understand.
Well then, my servant. It's a bit of a hassle, but let's get going. <cf>To collect a large sum of money from my husband!
Excuse me, sir, do you know <cf>the owner of the coin-operated pavilion?
...... something?
Brought to you by <cf>"From the other side of the coin..."
[--]!
I see, you guys are the understudies. I understand. <cf>The connection person couldn't come, so we were in trouble.
Then why don't you just go and get it in person?
Unfortunately, there are reasons why we can't do that. <cf>Well, there are a lot of circumstances.
I told my husband, 'The food has become bad. I miss the taste of my husband's food.'<cf> Tell him that. I'm asking you to do it.
...... but your husband trusts <cf> such a bumpy duo. ......
Did I just say something?
Oops, no, excuse me. Well, I'll leave it at that: ......
All right, all that's left to do now is to give the message to your husband.
But, my husband. You're scaring me for nothing. ...... <cf> There's nothing dangerous about it [--].
Who are you?
[--] [--]!
[--]!　That's the voice of the adventurer we just heard! <cf>Let's go!　Hurry up, servant!
You guys, you came!　No, but ...... no. <cf>Get away from here as fast as you can! ...... Ouch!
You are wounded, my lord! <cf>Someone got you!
Oh ...... thanks to you guys coming, but <cf> it's still lurking around here!
That was probably ......
If you don't want to die, follow the simple instructions. <cf> Or you'll end up like my friend.
[--]!　Where are you?　Where are you!
(Well, he's the one who made the connection ......!)
You and your adventurer there, if you don't want to get <cf>involved</cf>, you'd better leave like adults.
I'm not so outrageous as to kill innocent people.
(...... He doesn't seem to <cf>know</cf> that you guys brought the letter. This is convenient.)
(You guys should run. I'll take care of this.)
You can't do that with your injuries!
I'll take care of it here.
I'll take care of this.
But ......!
Don't worry. My servant is a bit strong.
...... sorry. I owe you!
All right, let's go!　Servant!
All right!　I beat you!
You guys are awesome! ......
Hmph! <cf> In the hands of our servants, they are nothing like that ......
<cf>We must be on our guard. <cf>I may still have company, I'm leaving this place!
Thanks to all of you for your help. <cf>Thank you so much!
Now you see why your husband trusts us so much?
Oh, I take my hat off to you. <cf> He's even more skilled than I am. <cf>And you've got a big mouth too: ......?
...... That being said, I can't even ask you why you were targeted, <cf>or what that letter was about.
Haha, I guess I can trust you to know what you're talking about.
...... Okay, that's enough of an allowance. <cf>We should get going.
Are you okay?　Are you sure you won't be attacked again?
We were caught by surprise earlier,......, <cf> but we already know the enemy's hand. We won't be delayed again.
Okay, okay.
You are strong. You might <cf>may</cf> have a good match with the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhardt, who boast of your bravery.
Please use that strength for what is right.
Then, this time I will do this. <cf>Take care of the message for your husband.
Mm, I'll leave it to you.
......Well, come to think of it, you have a very different tone from the first time, <cf>that's [--].
Well then, adventurer brother. Take care!
...... I'm also reasonably well-informed, so <cf>I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Well then...
Your husband is ...... back.
Oh, looks like you made it back in one piece.
'The rice has gone bad. I miss the taste of your husband.
Is that the message? <cf>I see... ...... he seems to be having a hard time.
Well, at any rate, thank you, thank you!
And you ......[I'll tell you the details if I accomplish the request successfully] <cf> I think you said?
Ah ...... was it? <cf>Then which would you prefer, a thank you or a reason?
What the hell is that?　That's not fair!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'll pay you thanks and give you the details.
Well, you know what? I've been doing a lot of deals to run this place, too, <cf> you know?
That was a letter that I didn't want my business partners to know about. <cf>If they get ahead of you, you're in trouble.
...... Is that the kind of content that would cause people to die?
...... Well, that's what it's about. <cf>I feel bad for the guy who made the connection.
Remember, you can't <cf>just cross this world with a pretty face.
Now, let's pay him a thank you. <cf>And let me collect that money as repayment for the debt.
Huh!　What the hell is that? <cf> You bastard!
Hahahaha!　I told you, didn't I? <cf>I told you, you can't cross the street with just pretty words.
Well, go back to your pavilion and eat your dinner. <cf> Consider it a wage, or something.
Muki-[ahh]!　I'm sorry! <cf>But I'll take my food!
...... The world is a lot dirtier than you guys think!
Hmm?　What did you say?
I said, don't eat dirty. <cf>Come on, let's go home.
<span size="Big">Gosh!　That thing is ......! </>
Hmm?　What's wrong?
Such a ....... No way, such a ......!
What's wrong? Did something bad happen!
Sorry about ....... We will take a moment of your time. <cf>I have some information I need to ask that boy.
Then we'll join you [--].
No, <span size="Big">I'm enough here on my own</>.
You guys go gather information about Avalitia.
What the hell is wrong with Tirith? <cf>Something serious looked on his face. ......
I don't know. <cf>I've never seen Tirith's face like that before.
Such a ...... face filled with impatience and determination. ......
By the way, do you recognize <cf>that boy Tillis is talking about?
No, I don't at all......
Hmm, I see. ......
No choice. Let's wait until Tillis comes back. <cf>I'll have to ask her what that boy is.
Thank you for your patience. <cf>I apologize for my selfish behavior.
That's okay. <cf> but can you tell us what you went to ask him?
That is ......
I'm sorry about ....... It's confidential.
You won't tell me either?
I am sorry, Mr. Ehrinse. <cf> But it's not about avaritia, so...
Just ......
Just?　What is it?
Its ....... <cf>..................
What is it? Can't you just say it plainly?
I'm asking you, without asking anything, <cf>could you please find what I'm talking about?
<cf>I want the back combined unit "[Shouten Wings]" of "Hero King Athénion Hyper Gold Armor"!
<span size="Big">What? </>
That's a very ostentatious name for a piece of equipment. ...... <cf>Maybe that boy is a reincarnated hero!
How is that possible? <cf>It's just the name of a toy for boys.
But why would <cf>you want such a thing?
Please excuse ...... for that. <cf>It's just that I really need it. ......
Oh, okay.
Yeah, okay.
Wait, wait, wait!　Don't decide on your own! <cf>They're not so easy to come by!
It was not for sale a long time ago. It's at a premium, and <cf>even if you want it, you'll have a hard time finding it!
If you search too hard, you'll just end up with a fake.
You know a lot, don't you, Mr. Feste? <cf>But what then?
<cf>I think I can finish toys from this era, if I can find similar components.
I know how to handle equipment such as omnistrons. <cf> But I don't know the shape or the detailed mechanism. ......
Ummm. <cf>I think the key to "Shoutenyou" is to reproduce that shine. <cf>I wish I could get some shiny material. ......
I believe <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> has a habit of collecting shiny things. ......
They're from the Baha Mar Plateau, around the "foothills of the calming mountains". <cf>We can borrow a few things from them.
All right!　Servants. You're up. <cf>Show them that you can count on me as your senior.
Thank you very much, sir!
You have gathered the parts for me, haven't you? <cf>Thank you, senpai!
Now, let's get started with the processing. <cf>Can you tell me the structure of the "Shouten Wings"?
Very well. First of all, we need a beautiful wing symbol. <cf>The image of an atenion galloping majestically through the sky [--].
[--] This one here and this one here will move. This one is gold and can be seen at ....... <cf>Oh, no. That's not it. ......
Got it. ......　<span size="Big">It's done! </>
This is the "[Shouten Wings]"......! <cf>Ah, finally in my hands ......
Oh dear, I managed it. <cf>Here, are you satisfied now?
Thank you very much! <cf>I'll get it to that boy right away!
...... hmm? <cf>You didn't want it?
No, not me especially. ......This is not the way to do it! <cf>I must hurry to the boy!
What, what is it? <cf>Anyway, we'll try to get there.
Wow!　Wow! <cf>It really is "Wings of Heaven"!
Are you sure you want to trade?　For this doll? <cf> I don't want to be asked to return it later, do you?
I told you before, it's a cheap toy that my grandma <cf>bought by mistake!
That's fine. <cf>I'd rather have it.
Well, I don't need a doll for a girl, you know. <cf>I was just wondering if I should throw it away.
Well, I'll trade you, as promised. <cf>Yay!　I've always wanted one of these!
Tillis, that doll is ......
......
<span size="Big">I did it!
<span size="Big">Yay! </>
<span size="Big">It's a limited edition Gilbert Family! </>
Yes!
This is a super-premium doll for enthusiasts to drool over!　I thought ......<cf> in this day and age, but I never thought I'd be able to get one as soon as it came!
Wow~ I'm so happy [~~]!　Cute [~~]! <cf>It's definitely cuter [～～～～] than it looked in the data!
Let me explain. The Gilbert Family is a series of dolls for girls with <cf>deformed monsters!
Well, yes, that's right! <cf>That's a very clear explanation, Feste-san!
......, what are you making me explain? <cf>Hey there, Tirith, you're getting carried away there!
<cf>You're not going to change the past, are you? <cf>There is a possibility that history will be changed because of that doll[--].
No, there is not. It's all right. The simulation is perfect. <cf>I have done all the calculations for this day. It's flawless.
Oh, no. <cf> I'm not giving up my face, here.
Oh, dear. Tirith has volunteered <cf>for such a dangerous journey, so please allow me at least a reward.
Now, then: ......
Well, let's get our heads together and go kill avaritia!
I must find a dollhouse that fits this doll. <cf>I'm sure that in this day and age, that thing will be ...... hmmm ......
I think I've turned on the ...... mania. <cf>This is something you'd better be prepared for in the future. ......
......That's right, my servant. Wait a minute.
Those two ...... seem to be having an interesting conversation.
How are you feeling? <cf> You look very tired. ......
Thanks, but I'm fine. But I'm fine. <cf>I'm sorry for worrying you.
You say that, but it sounds like you're being very strong.
I'm sure it's the chronoleptic effect, but <cf>I guess the environment is not so good either!
A place like this, with all this dirt and dust, <cf> is not suitable for you, Mr. Erlinse.
Indeed, I've never been in a place like this before,......<cf>but I'm prepared for that, too, since I've come to this time period.
[Speaking of the time period, there is something that has been bothering me.
What is it?　Anything you want to say.
Isn't this outfit ...... a little different from the people around you?
Huh?
Tillis is not so different yet, but <cf>my clothes are not appropriate for the environment, or ......?
That's ....... But I've properly looked up <cf>the attire of this period in the database and prepared it for you.
Perhaps if we go to a more crowded place, <cf>more people will be dressed that way......
I hope that's the case......
I'd like to try to dress <cf> like Tillis, which is easy to move around in, since we're going to ......
I'd like to dress like Tillis, but I can't!　You must not dress <cf> like such a commoner, even if you are Erinse-sama!
But ......
Even if you make such a face, what is not good is not good!
Tirith's tease: ......
Uu......! <cf>And anyway, please rest now!　Voila!
...... wasn't interesting at all. <cf>It was just a lover's quarrel between the lady and her sidekick......
<cf>Well, it's true that Erinze is having a hard time getting used to her new surroundings.
How do you feel?　How about I offer her something to cheer her up?
Yes, let's do that.
Yes, let's do that. I will.
Mm-hmm. I'm sure they'll be so impressed with our kindness that they'll give us a substantial <cf>gratuity!
She seems like quite a lady, after all. ...... <cf>[--]Just kidding.
Tirith is also my servant. <cf>You can't just leave her alone as your senior.
<cf><cf>What is the best food around here?
First, let's ask the merchants around here.
Hey, merchant! <cf> Do you know of any energizing food around here?
Food that cheers you up? <cf> Hmmm, yes, ......
If you want a drink, how about "Jug-Ade"? <cf> It's a nutritious drink.
We're out of it right now, unfortunately,<cf> but it's a great way to regain strength.
If you pick me up some of the "Juggies", <cf>I'll give you a glass of it!
I see. ...... <cf>Thank you, merchant!
<cf>You heard that, too, right? <cf>Now let's get the "Jug Fruits"!
Merchant! <cf>I've picked up some "Jug Fruits!
Oh, wow!　That's a fine fruit.
Oh, you promised to serve me "Jug-Aid", didn't you? <cf> I'll make it soon, just wait a minute!
Hoi!　It's ready!
Yay!　Thank you! <cf>Thank you for the drink!
Oh!　Drink it while it's fresh!
Okay, let's get this to Erinze.
I hope this helps Erinse feel <cf>a little better!
...... Hmm?　What are you two talking about again?
......I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but if you're having a hard time, please don't hesitate to contact me.
If you are in pain, <cf>couldn't you just go back to your own time?
Even though this was the only way, it seems that <cf>Mr. Ehrinse has been burdened more than expected[--].
......It's true that it's a little painful, but if you're weak at this level, you won't be able to save the planet.
Hey, Tirith. <cf>You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
I've never been out there before.
So I'm really glad to be here, even if it is in this way.
It really is such a ....... <cf> I can't believe how beautiful the sky is here. ......
I couldn't have imagined it when I was taught by Bashraal......
......Oh, it's true. <cf>It sure is...... very beautiful......
This sky continues until our time, <cf>and even further into the future!
<cf>I feel again now ...... that it is my mission to try to make this beautiful world last forever!
So, although your concern is very welcome, <cf>I cannot accept your proposal to leave as is.
...... understand. <cf>If that is your wish, Master Erinse.
Tirith here, I swear I will <cf>help you, even at the risk of my life!
No. My life is my first priority.
But [--]
If you die first, <cf>I will follow you, won't I?
U......!
Totally ....... <cf> If you just shut up and listen, you'll have another lover's quarrel.
Ha!　Chi, lover's quarrel......! <cf> No, sir!　I mean, why are you listening!
I heard you, so I can't help it. <cf> Be that as it may, here, let's do this!
Is this ......?
I prepared this for you and me. They say it will make you feel better. <cf>...... I thought you might like it for Erinze.
Well, thank you very much!
...... Well, what the heck. We've come all this way in this time. <cf>I think you should have a little fun without getting all uptight.
You'll run out of breath if you keep stuffing yourself so earnestly. <cf>Isn't that right?
<cf>Albeit in a way, I and my servants have become friends. <cf>It's not just the two of you on this journey anymore.
Thank you for ....... <cf>It is one more thing I am glad to have come to this time!
I'm glad I have more servants too. <cf>Here, Tirith. Give Erinse a drink.
Gosh, ......!　I'm still not used to being treated like a servant, but <cf>I appreciate the offer!
Well, you can thank me at the market price.
Ha!　You're taking money?
Oh, how much is it? <cf>I wonder if this jewelry will be enough......
You don't have to pay, Mr. Ehrinse! <cf> I mean, you're obviously paying too much!
<cf>I'll do the job for you, right? <cf>I have a job for you, take it!
I'm sorry, but all requests for this one <cf>are supposed to go through me[--].
What?　You subhuman brat, you're so cocky. <cf>Well, fine, let's talk business.
...... So?　What is your job?
Mm. <cf>An oracle priestess of the Order of Buffalia is in this village right now, right?
I'm looking for something to donate to her.
Is it an endowment ......? You must be deeply religious.
Yes, I believe in the oracle priestess!
After all, the word of an oracle priestess is priceless. If you can show me <cf> the path I should take, I will be even more successful than I am now!
To receive her words, I must contribute something more expensive, <cf>rare, and beautiful than the others!
Yes,...... you must deliver something more valuable than others, and <cf>you must have enough goods to catch the eye of the priestesses!
That's why you guys should go and pick up a "rosé sapphire"<cf>. Right now.
...... I see. And what's the reward?
I'm giving the others work to do. <cf>So, the one who brings the best [--].
Screw you, I say.
Fu......?　Now, what the heck?
<span size="Big">I said, <span size="Big">don't be silly</span>!
I refuse such a request, <span size="Big">sshit! </>
What ......?　You, you ......
If I had listened patiently for the money, <cf>well, you would be talking from the top of your head!
Let's go, servant. <cf>There is no point in wasting your time on this boorish nonsense!
<cf> You insulted me! <cf> Poor man's habit!　You're a poor man's habit!
You may have money, but you don't have the vocabulary to curse~?
Gghh......Gghh......!!! <cf>You and others will be poor for the rest of your lives!　Suck it up!
<cf>You'll be poor for the rest of your life! <cf> We have the right to choose our requests, too!
Is that okay?　<cf>If you want money, you can't deal with such a rich guy, right?
...... What is it?　That girl. <cf>You're looking at me all the time.
......You're looking at her very intently. <cf>Servant, let's go talk to her for a moment.
Hey, you've been looking at us for a while now, <cf> what do you want?
Oh, well, ...... I was wondering if I could make a request as well.
......Would you like to talk to us?
<cf>I'll tell you what you're asking for. <cf>Will you accept or not?
Yes, I will!　Um,...... I want some flowers. <cf>Flowers to make flower crowns.
I want to give them to the oracle priestess.
You want the word of a priestess too?
Oh no!　I am afraid! <cf> I only want to cheer up the priestess.
<cf> I long to be a miko. <cf>I would like to serve by your side someday, if it comes true.
For now, I just want to be happy if I can heal the miko who is on a hard pilgrimage with <cf>a flower crown,</cf> even just a little. ......
But I couldn't make <cf>the beautiful crown I wanted</cf> with just the flowers I could find in the village. ......
Mother said we shouldn't go outside the village because of the fear of monsters. ......
So that's why she turned to us.
That's a very cute request. What do you think?
Of course, I'll take it.
Of course I will.
You sure?　Thank you!
You're more than worth it, you know. <cf>So, how many flowers do you need?
I'd like them to be a prominent decoration. ...... Uh, ......<cf>Three would be great!
Okay, I'll take three beautiful flowers. Three beautiful flowers. <cf>Wait a minute. I'll look around here.
<cf>These flowers should be in high places around here.
Here, I picked the flowers. Is this okay?
Thank you!　Wow, beautiful. ......
Let's see,...... you put this one here,...... and then this one here,...... and then this one here,...... and then this one here,...... and then this one here,......
[--] There you go!　How's it look?
Oh!　Looks good on the oracle maiden.
Hehehe ...... I hope the priestess is pleased.
I'm sure she will. Now, let's go deliver it right away. <cf>Let us see to it.
Yes!
Hmm?　Looks like you have a prior engagement. ...... that's ......
What do you think?　Isn't it a fine piece? <cf> I'll donate this to you.
In exchange, you will pay a visit to the oracle maiden. ......
......I will ask you a question. <cf> Did you get this by your own power?
Huh?　Oh, yes. <cf>It is the one and only thing I paid for!
...... I see.
Donations will be gratefully received. <cf> May the Gods of Buffalia bless you.
Mm, now to the priestess [--].
The priestess of the oracle is a busy woman. <cf>None of them can see you now. Please leave us.
Huh?　What are you saying? <cf> I have donated such a wonderful thing?
Please take it back.
You know, I [--]
I will return your donated items if need be.
The priestess will only speak to those who are truly religious, <cf>so
[--] please take it back.
......!　Hmph, hmph! <cf> You are a vile priestess. You can have it!
What a bunch of rich people you are! ......
...... scary voice. What was that?
Don't worry about it. They are foolish enough to try to take advantage of the prestige of Einlein-sama.
They have no faith at all, but only want to <cf>use</cf> you!
There is no need to <cf>preach</cf> the word of God in Buffalia to those who have no faith!
...... It's been a long time, but the obstacles seem to have gone away. <cf>Let's go, too.
Are you guys contributing too?
Yes, well ......
<cf>Here, you speak properly. <cf>We made it for the priestess, didn't we?
Uh, ah, let's see,...... this for the oracle priestess,......
Is it a flower crown ......
I made it from flowers in the village!　Oh, but I had these people pick the beautiful flowers for decoration.
The oracle priestesses seem to have a hard time on their pilgrimage, so I thought it would be nice if these flower crowns could help them feel a little better.
Well, so ...... that ......
I also want to become a miko of the Order someday and help <cf>the oracle miko-sama!
So, miko, please wait until then!
......!
Oh, that ......!
<span size="Big">Hyah!　<span size="Big">Hyah! </>
Einlein-sama!　I told you <cf>that you should not go outside without warning!
I'm sorry. But ......
Good luck on your pilgrimage, miko! <cf>So, uh, if you don't mind, I'd like to send you some flowers: ......
Thank you ....... Very beautiful flower crown!
I'm glad ....... Really ......
The maiden maiden ......!
You both have such nice smiles on your faces.
Isn't it <cf>good to have this kind of relaxation in between the rigorous pilgrimage?
It's totally ...... unavoidable. ......
<cf>You are a girl of faith, my dear. <cf>I will reward you for making the priestess smile!
Eh?　Wow, sweets!
...... Please keep the others in the dark.
Yes, I will!　Thank you very much!
Hmmm... ......
Mm-hmm. After all, a gift should be <cf> heartfelt.
Well, I'm most pleased with money that is heartfelt!
I picked some flowers to make a flower crown.
What's the matter?　You've been strangely quiet since a while ago.
...... No, nothing in particular.
[--]Miss Ehrinse, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but <cf> are you hungry?
What?　How did you know?
Because Erinse-sama has a habit of becoming <cf>distracted and silent</cf> when she is hungry.
Oh, is that so? <cf>I hate that, I hadn't noticed that at all. ......
Let's get something to eat. <cf>Do you have something to eat?
I want something to eat......
I want to eat ...... sweet cake
Oh, I'm sorry. That's impossible. <cf>It's a little difficult here.
Perhaps the food at Salamzaat <cf>doesn't suit your palate</cf>?
No, not at all! <cf>It's just a little spicy, I guess. ......
<cf>I am sure that I would like to try the spicy dishes here. <cf>I surely miss sweet cakes too!
Well, Feste-san? <cf>I love cakes too!
<cf>When I was in the original time, Tillis and I <cf>often had tea parties.
We would <cf>splash our plates full of colorful little cakes ......
They were so delicious! Hey, Tillis.
Uh, yeah. Yes, I know. ......
But is it cake...... cake? ......
I don't really have a craving for it right now. <cf>This is not the time to say that, and [--].
No, I think I can manage as long as I have the ingredients. <cf>Yes, even I can make a cupcake or so: ......
Um, senpai. I'm sorry, but may I ask you to <cf>gather the ingredients for the cupcakes?
Thank you very much! <cf>......, please wait a moment!
Here is the list of ingredients and the money. <cf>Please show them to the shopkeeper at the store.
I will negotiate to rent the kitchen at the bar, and we will meet up there later.
Yay, cake, cake, cake! <cf>I'm going to eat a lot!
<cf>I'm sorry, it's my own fault. ...... <cf>Please do!
<cf>Welcome! <cf>We have a good selection.
<cf>We have a good selection. <cf>Would you be able to get us a few of the ingredients in this memo?
Yes, yes. ...... What are you going to make with these?
Sweet, sweet cupcakes!
Oh, cupcakes. <cf>I'll give you some extra sugar if you like.
And [--] hmm?
Hey, are these all the ingredients for cupcakes?
Hm?　No?
Hmmm, interesting stuff to use. Well, okay.
Yes, I've got all the ingredients. <cf> I'm not much for sweets, but I hope I can make it right.
Well then, I hope to see you again!
I haven't had anything sweet in a long time. <cf>Now, let's head to the bar where Tillis and the others are.
I see you bought the ingredients. <cf>Thank you!
<cf>We have just negotiated with them and they will let us use their kitchen.
Oh!　Then let's get to it. <cf>I'll help you too.
Oh, no, I'm fine on my own. It's a simple thing. <cf>Please all sit down and wait.
Is that so?　Then I'll wait for you.
I'm looking forward to it. <cf>Thank you for your help, Tillis.
Yes, you can count on me!
Thank you for waiting. <cf>The cupcakes are ready!
Well, how lovely!
Oh, these look delicious!
We made a lot of them, so <cf>please don't hesitate to eat as many as you like!
Oh, I won't hold back. That's it!
Oh, no!　That's no good! <cf>I'll put it on your plate!　Wait!
There is no need to wait for something delicious. <cf>Now, I'm going to eat!
That's really no good!
<cf>Ah, !
Oh, ......!
....... <cf>............
<span size="Big">Goodbye World</>!
Kyaaaaa! <cf>Mr. Feste has collapsed, bubbling over!
Oh my goodness!　I will go and call someone!
Erinse, please wait!　Erinse!
Tillis, what the hell did you do to the cupcakes?
I didn't poison them! <cf> But I just made a cake for me to eat: ......
[--]Hiyara!　Nyanzohore!　It's extremely hot! <cf>Ippirunrei hiki ga karihoraeru spicy!
<cf>Yes, you're awake. <cf>Here, have some water.
[--]Puhah! <cf>Rameja, my tongue is numb. ......
Tirith, this is ......
...... sorry, I actually don't have a sweet tooth. <cf>That's why I make my own cupcakes with very spicy specifications......
Wahi can't wait to hijack it.
That's why I told you to wait until you could share. <cf>because Mr. Feste ignores that: ......
Hare?　Hero Lord and Ehrinze had a <cf>sweet tea party and ......
...... Erinze-sama doesn't <cf>know</cf> that I don't like sweets!
What is it? I should have just said "Hiyan".
It is my duty to do the Lord's will. <cf> For that purpose, it does not matter what my taste is!
For me, the best thing<cf> is that Erinse-sama is smiling!
Muuu......
Senpai, would you please <cf>go check on Master Erlinse?
I think he probably went to the clerk at the counter <cf>to ask for help.
Best regards. <cf>And ...... please keep this story confidential.
Oh, I'm just asking the clerk for a glass of water. ...... <cf>Are you okay, Feste?
Well, thank goodness. ......
Perhaps you were listening to the story?
I'm sorry ....... <cf>I tried to go back once and that's when ......
I was all about myself and <cf>didn't try to get to know Tillis's preferences!
...... I consider her a friend. <cf>But I'm making sacrifices for such a trivial thing.
I can't help but hate myself for that. ......
Next time we have a tea party, I'll prepare some spicy food.
...... No, no. No, no, that is not allowed.
If I prepare spicy food without saying anything, I will hurt the pride of Tillis, who has kept quiet up to this point.
So until <cf>Tillis comes forward on her own,<cf>I would like to play the fool.
Now, let's go back before Tirith and the others find out. <cf>We must continue with the tea party.
And ...... please keep this story <cf>confidential</cf>.
<cf>Tillis. <cf>I'd like to talk about how this is going to work[--].
It's ......, but it's ....... <cf>It's ...... still ......
Tillis?　Hey, Tillis-?
[--]Ha!　Yes, what is it?
What is it, are you all right? <cf> You were mumbling something all by yourself. ......
I'm fine, I'm fine!　Don't worry about it.
Is that so?　If there's something on your mind, I'm here to help you. <cf>At any rate, 100 Lunos for one.
...... In that case, may I <cf>take care of Mr. Ehrinse's escort for a little while?
I have a few personal matters to attend to.
No problem, the escort is entrusted to me!
Thank you very much. <cf>Really, I'll be right back!
What a suspicious-looking ....... <cf>I've got a bottle on my horn!
How can I say ......, <cf>I have a feeling something funny is about to happen ......
The direction in which he ran off is the direction of the temple......
All right, my servant. <cf>Let's take Erinse with us and follow him.
I don't see Tirith ......
Strange, isn't it? <cf> I thought she went this way. ......
Einlein! <cf> Have you seen Tirith around here?
Tirith......?
She came by a little while ago. We had a little chat. ......
Oh!　What did you talk about?
We talked about what kind of gift would make you happy. ...... <cf> I said that I would be most happy with a "thought". ......
Gifts....... And Tillis?
I think she went to the square......
Well, thanks for the tip!
Okay, we'll go to the square too.
Tillis ...... is nowhere to be found here either.
Ho-ho-ho, we are <cf>a hundred years too young to move around in secret. We'll find you. ......
Hey, you three. You three look like you've got a bad aura about you. <cf> What are you doing?　What are you doing?
Elektra. <cf> Have you seen Tirith around here?
Tirith, is that you? <cf>Yes, she was here just now.
You asked me what Salamzaat's specialty is. <cf>What food is most popular among your followers?　And ......
So I just asked people and went <cf>towards the entrance and exit of the city!
You said it's a specialty?　Hmmm ....... <cf>How was Tirith then?
I don't know?　Even if it was different than usual, <cf>I'm not close enough to know that, and ......
That's true, too. <cf>Well, thanks for the tip.
Now for the city entrances and exits. <cf>Let's go!
Tirith!　There you are, in a place like this.
Master Erinse!　And the seniors too! <cf>Why ......
<cf>Well, I was just wondering. <cf>By the way, were you ...... out there alone?
Oh, I, uh, ...... needed a few things.
Oh?　What do you need?
I'm sorry!　Freshness is important! <cf> I'm in a hurry, so here!
Ah!　Holy shit, wait, hey!
What's going on?　In such a hurry ......
I was asking Einlein about gifts and <cf>Electra about specialties and food......
And if he had gone outside the city to <cf>pick something that 'freshness is important'<cf>......
If it becomes?
I don't know!　Anyway, let's go after Tirith!
Tillis, I found you!
Oh, you're already here. ......
Ho-ho-ho, we're 200 years too young to be trying to pull the wool over our eyes. <cf>So?　What was your business?
You are my servant. Now, answer me.
......It can't be helped. I managed to get there in time.
Well, ...... sir. <cf>Please take this!
Oh?　This is [--].
Bento ......?
Bento ......?
Oh, um, I've always been very grateful to my senpai ......, <cf> but I couldn't give anything back to you.
So, I thought I would at least give her some gift, <cf>Mr. Einlein told me that feelings are important......
So I asked Elektra about it and <cf>made a lunch box with Salaamzat's specialties</cf>.
It's not perfect, but it's ....... <cf>I put a lot of gratitude into it. ......
Oh, it's a Salamzert specialty, but <cf>I made sure it's not that spicy!
So, you know, I was wondering if you could accept it......
Well, ......!　Isn't this the first time Tirith has cooked for <cf> someone other than me and my family?
Ha, yes ....... I thought it would be <cf>homemade or 'heavy'. ......
Thanks, I'll take it.
Senpai ......!
What, it's just a thank-you event? <cf>I had a hunch it would be fun, but my horns are not to be trusted.
By the way,...... you said when we met earlier that <cf>"freshness is important".
<cf>That was for lunch box ingredients, wasn't it? <cf>What on earth is in it?
Yes, I have a few things in my lunch box!　It's the famous <cf>"Meen dancing and eating" from Salamzat!
<span size="Big">E......</>
Meen that is less than 3 days old and still tender is dressed with Salamzat <cf>spices</cf>, and freshness is the key to this specialty!
I tasted it myself and it is very tasty!
Please visit ......!
My hunch about the eagle's horn was still excellent. ......
Come on, senpai. Please eat without hesitation!
E, Erinse,......!
Please accept Tillis's ...... feelings!
Senpai?　......I'm sorry, am I bothering you after all?
--I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
......Ah, quite delicious!
One ......2 piece ......3 piece ....... <cf>It's still not enough......
What is it? <cf> You're counting pages in your notebook with a gloomy face!
Oh, you guys are ......!
Actually [--]no, it's still good. <cf>I'll take care of this myself.
<cf>Well, now that you put it that way, I'm even more curious. <cf>What, were you counting love letters to Einlein?
No, sir!　It's a diary!　[--]Ah!
Oh, ho-ho-ho, a diary, eh?
...... Well, it seems I lost some pieces of paper in my notebook when I was running away from the bugs.
It's more of a personal diary or complaint,......, <cf>it's really just a scribble, nothing of value.
But the fact that the pages don't line up<cf>makes me feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable.
And then there's that ......
This is not good!　It's not right to abandon those in need, <cf>it's part of being an adventurer!
<cf>We will find that piece of paper you dropped. Hey, servant!
You can't go around looking for it if you're not good with bugs, can you? <cf> Wouldn't Einlein be sad if something happened to you again?
I am very grateful for your offer, but ......, <cf> you seem to be strangely happy, don't you?
What?　Nothing? <cf>(It sounds super interesting to hear people's complaints. I want to read it!)
It's straight from the heart, though!
Leave it to us to find the pieces of paper.
Leave it to us to find the pieces of paper.
U...... but yeah. <cf>It still feels weird to have lost it, and ......
Please let us help you look for the piece of paper. <cf>I've lost all four pieces of paper.
So, if you can, I would appreciate it if you would not <cf>read them even if you find them......
<span size="Big">Mm, I won't read them, I won't read them! </>
I don't trust you!　I'm happy to hear your sentiments even if it's ......, <cf>Please help me find the piece of paper!
Oh, is this the piece of paper that Yorke lost? <cf>Hmm, what is it ......?
<cf>The laundry that my father put out had colored clothes mixed in. I always tell him to separate them because the colors will shift<cf>! >
＜When I warned him, he said, "[You] are too detailed. I told him that he should leave that kind of work to the maids.
<cf>That's why workaholics are so hard to deal with. ...... First of all, laundry is <cf>my stress reliever</cf>, so I never give in.
...... I see. <cf> Is this the family situation of the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Barnhart?
Is this a piece of paper in Yoruk?　Which one is it ......?
<cf> The other day, Father came home with a pastry.
＜The customary "gifts for the Knights made by Veronica's mother." ......
＜It's just a pastry, but, Father, please realize that it's not enough.
<cf> Veronica's own handmade sweets. ......
<cf> Veronica, you should just confess it. <cf>I guess you have to say it directly to your insensitive father to get the message.
<cf>It's frustrating for me to watch. <cf>I don't know what to do: ......
Oh ...... hohoho ...... well well well well ......
Oh, there's a piece of paper!　Let's have a look: ......
<cf> I am troubled by Mr. Hugo's love of women. <cf> He is the best civilian officer in the world. ......
<cf>I don't want to get too close to Einlein, so <cf> let's not turn in documents related to the Order.
Hugo ....... Huh, where have I heard that before?
I got a piece of paper!　Now what's inside: ......?
<cf> I've done a bad thing to Carveen. When things are settled, the three of us can go on a vacation to Cape Lawehala.
<cf> Carveen, who is too serious, needs a break.
<cf>The question is how to get Einlein out of there ....... <cf>I know he'll be pissed, but I guess we'll have to take advantage of his father's prestige.
<cf> But okay, even if he's mad at me. <cf>I want her to enjoy her freedom.
Hmmm... ...... these three seem to get along really well.
Sorry to keep you waiting. I got all four pieces of paper back!
Thank you very much! <cf>So, what's inside: ......
I read it.
Right, right? It's okay, I know.
It's not really anything to be embarrassed about. <cf>That was too cute for a bitch.
I was hoping for more of that intellectual bespectacled <cf>blackness in the belly</cf>. ......
What kind of image do you have of me? ......
Well, it's okay. <cf>I'm relieved to have the pieces of paper together like this.
I'm a nervous person, and <cf>everything has to be done properly.
In that aspect, I think I'm suited to be a civil servant. ......
...... I think my father would have really wanted me to be a fine knight <cf> like him!
What are you saying? <cf>A parent is a parent and a child is a child. <cf>As long as they know their own talents and make the most of them, there should be no problem.
Well, ultimately, for a parent, it is <cf>just fine</cf> that their child is doing well. No need to be so anxious about it.
...... I think I understand why Einlein and Carveen <cf> trust you guys!
Well, we're going to go now [--].
I'll be here a little while longer.
Okay. Be careful you don't get attacked by bugs again.
I'll be fine. <cf>I'm burning a lot of bug repellent right now!
Well then, <cf>thank you both so much for your time at ......!
Oh, see you later!
I knew if I told ...... I was a bitch, they would look for me. <cf>I'm glad to have this back in my possession.
I'm <cf>sorry about the deception, but ......
I'll do what I can. <cf>So ...... parents are parents and children are children.
[--]Okay, a quick sear so you don't burn it,......<cf>and a little puzzle to connect the pieces of paper,...... ......
...... and now it's done!
The words of the imprisoned Lord King. <cf>I've got to get it to that one as soon as possible. ......
Oh my ....... <cf>Maybe you're not busy?
If so, let me offer you some work. <cf>I'm in a bit of a pickle.
Trouble?　I'm all ears, but ......
Yes, as a matter of fact, two members of the ...... congregation have gone missing.
This area is dangerous. We were conducting an investigation to <cf>examine the path of future pilgrimages[--].
Two of the members of the congregation we sent as investigators have not returned yet.
The others are tired from serving, and <cf>I would like to go directly to search for them.
These two men are <cf>dispatched to geographically opposite locations</cf> ......
Simply put, we are short on manpower.
Yes, I am ashamed to say that is true.
If they are involved in something dangerous, <cf>we need to help them out as soon as possible!
So, if you don't mind, <cf>could you please lend us your help?
Understood. I will help in the search.
I understand. I will help in the search.
<span size="Big">So!　I got a manpower! </>
[--]Gohon!　No, I'd be very grateful. <cf>The Gods of Buffalia will be very pleased with your spirit of service!
Ah ......, you can use a plain tone of voice, if you like. <cf>I know how hard it is to put on a catsuit.
Oh, here's my real tone. <cf>I don't know what you mean by catcalls. ...... ughhhhhh...
Now, please get yourself together. <cf>I have marked the search area on the map.
Please, please look for our lost congregation.
Um, are you a member of the church, sister?
Eh ......, yes. Yes, but ......
Are you lost by any chance?　We received a search request from <cf>Electra......
...... now what?
......?　We've been asked by <cf>Electra</cf> to find a lost member of the congregation. ......
<span size="Big">Whoa!　It works for the mind! </>
Hee!　What the heck!
Oh, sorry ....... <cf> That ...... Electra, were you worried about me?
Oh, oh ....... If she is involved in something dangerous, <cf>I must help her out as soon as possible, [--].
That's why I said that kind of thing is moe!
Heehee!　What was that all about?
I'm sorry. As expected of Electra's sister, <cf> and I was so impressed. ......
Sister, sir: ......?
Yes. Sister Electra is the one who deserves to be called <cf>"Sister"!
She has only been a member of the Order for a short time, but <cf>her strength has been the center of attention from the very beginning.
And in recognition of his loyalty and faith, <cf>he was soon chosen to be Einlein-sama's bodyguard.
Oh, ...... that strength is certainly eye-catching.
And then there's that beauty, isn't she?　There's something wild and wild about her, and the occasional glimpse of roughness is even more appealing.
She does her duty, after all, and she's <cf>reliable and caring</cf>.
But the occasional glimpse of her screwed-up ways only adds to her charm, and I don't know what to do anymore.
I know what to do. Calm down. Take a deep breath.
I'm sorry about that.
Sorry about ....... When I <cf>talk about Sister Elektra, I get so passionate about her!
I can't keep that sister waiting forever. <cf>Go back to Salamzaat and show her your face.
<cf>Yes, yes! <cf>We mustn't cause her any more trouble.
By the way, you, your tone is different from before. ......
Eh?　What do you mean?
Oh no, we are similar in that way. ......　You know, you often make such obvious mistakes, but I'm not so sure that's what you're doing.
Deep breath, my friend.
Let's get back to Elektra quickly, my servant. <cf>...... eagle, I'm getting a little tired.
Sorry to keep you waiting. The congregation is safe.
Oh, thank goodness! <cf>We've just brought another one with us.
So both of you are safe now. <cf>I'm so glad: ......
<cf>Sorry, Elektra! <cf>I lost my bearings in the sandstorm!
I, too, am sorry for the trouble I have caused you. ......
...... okay?　If anything happens to you guys, <cf>Master Einlein will be heartbroken,<cf> right?
I am not <cf>training</cf> to grieve the oracle priestess who is supposed to support me!
Ha, yes!　I am sorry!
If you are sorry, then have an eye for danger! <cf>If you see danger, pull back!　Feel it by instinct!
If you can't even protect yourself, God forbid you should even think about it!
...... is pretty harsh.
<cf>You have blundered, and I order you all to be suspended. <cf> You will rest for two days.
What?　Is that ......
Okay?　Don't help me clean up or anything, okay? <cf>All you have to do is just lie around, okay?
Being lost in the desert takes more damage<cf>than you think. Eat, sleep, and let your body recover.
<span size="Big">Sister ......! </>
[--]Gohonk!　Sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so obnoxious. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation!
It's not much, but here is the reward: ....... <cf>Thank you so much!
Well, I'll leave you with this. <cf>I will report the details to Mr. Einlein.
Oh ...... I see. Well, well, well.
Hey?　Hey! <cf>It's so good, isn't it?　You know what I mean!
A scolding full of kindness while saying harsh things! <cf> Oh my god, as expected of Elektra-sis!
Oh, no, he's one of them!
She could have easily cut off a lowly person like us<cf>, and yet she even sent out a search request!
<cf>I even got rescued by my sister herself. <cf>It was so cool!　I couldn't help but fall in love with her!
What a sneaky thing to do!　Tell me more about it!
You know, I was hiding behind a rock, hiding from the monsters, <cf>and then my sister came and saved me.
Oh my God, wait, that's impossible. <cf>I can't do that because it would increase my faith in her.
Let's go to ....... I don't think we can follow you.
<cf>It's enough for us to know that Electra's type is very popular among women. ......
And then there's the sister!
Oh my god, I'm getting more religious!　I'll have to write about it in the bulletin!
I wonder if it's really impossible. I'll pay extra if it's money.
That being said, <cf>I can only say what I don't have is what I don't have: ......
I'll do something about that. I know it's impossible, please.
But ......
What's the matter?　You seem to be in some kind of trouble.
Oh, Feste-chan! <cf>You have come at just the right time!
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to help me convince this gentleman<cf>. Feste-chan, you're all talk. ......
Hey, who's all talk? Who's the one?
......? <cf>You are the adventurers from ...... "Insect Fortress in [Akatsuki]. ......?
Hm?　[Ah!　You are the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Barnhart, <cf> the knight who was by Dunkirk!　I believe her name is [--].
Veronica. I am the deputy commander.
And what order could such a deputy commander possibly have for such a lowly merchant?
Who is this unprofitable merchant? Who are you?
Well, I'm going to get even with you for what you did earlier! <cf>[--]So, what is this unreasonable order?
<cf>"Fresh leaves of ayraza. <cf>[--]You know what I'm talking about, don't you Feste?
Oh, ...... the flowers and grasses used for dyes. <cf>The one you dye blue, right?
Yes. The flowers used to make the deep, bright blue color that reminds us of the sea in Asterlys.
But now is not the season. <cf>And it's also the time of year when all the places are out of stock[--].
But I really <cf>want a blue scarf dyed with it!
...... and well, it's been like this for a while now.
No, do you really need that now? <cf>In a few more weeks, it will be easier to collect it.
Then it will be available in Barnhart as an import. <cf>Why not just buy it then?
...... That's not going to work. We won't make it in time.
Muuu...... I'm in trouble......
[--]Ah!
What's the matter, Feste?
I think I might have an idea.
What?　Really?
When I was wandering around the Asteria Plain before, I saw an early-blooming "fresh leaves of ailaza".
<cf> But it was a monster-infested area. <cf>At that time, I had no choice but to run back[--].
[But now he's here.
[--][--]?
<cf>You said earlier that you would pay me extra money? <cf> If you are true to your word, we will go and get it for you.
<cf>A knight is not false. <cf> Especially a knight of the mighty Barnhardt!
I ask you to do the same! <cf>As long as we have the dye, we can fulfill your order!
[So, what do we do now?
We have no choice. Let's go get some.
Well, I've taken care of the order!
Yes, I did. And while we're at it, would you mind picking up some <cf>"talakua nuts" as well?
They give a more beautiful color when cooked together. <cf>This one is a perennial, so you won't have any trouble collecting it.
<cf>"Ailaza fresh leaves" and "talakua berries"? <cf>Good. I'll take a cut of your fee for that, right?
Yes, of course. Thank you very much.
Well then, my servant, let's head out. <cf>There are two places to collect. Are you ready?
I have collected the fresh leaves of Ailaza and the fruits of Talaqua. <cf>Is this enough?
Oh, yes!　Enough for a scarf!
Okay, I'll go ask our craftsman for them now. <cf>Wait a minute.
What do you think?　I think the color came out beautifully. ......
Mm, it's a beautiful blue!　It feels great to the touch, and <cf>Veronica will love it!
Good, good, good! <cf>If Feste says so, then I'm sure of it.
Oh, I'm sorry, but could you do me another favor? <cf>I need you to take this to Veronica.
I've got some business to attend to after this. <cf>Master Veronica is at the temple.
<cf>I have no choice. I'll take the money for the delivery.
<cf>Then let's go, my servant. <cf>Take a ride to the temple!
I have a delivery for Lady Veronica. ...... Hmm?
Hmm?　You are the ones who were at that ......
Dada, Dunkirk!
Well, well, well. Since there is a vice-commander Veronica, <cf> shouldn't there be a Commander Dunkirk? ......
You are very bold to call out Lord Dunkirk!
<cf> I've just delivered it to you. <cf>He went to the trouble of delivering it to you, didn't he?
That's ....... Yes, that's right. ...... Yes.
Mm, that's right. Here, a delivery from the merchant. <cf>You may accept it.
May I see it here now?
As long as you're okay with it. I think it's in good condition.
I see. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to ......
....... What a vibrant blue.
Yes, it's wonderful ....... <cf>It's exactly what I ordered.
Isn't it?　<cf>The craftsmanship of the merchant's artisans is highly esteemed.
No, it is truly beautiful. <cf>It is indeed the product of a trading city.
<cf>It will surely suit you. <cf> You have chosen well, Veronica.
No, this is for Master Dunkirk.
For me?
......I heard<cf> that your wife liked this color from Asterlys. I've come all the way to the area.
Mrs. ......?
...... Oh, yes. That's right. Thank you.
I'll leave you alone for a moment. I need you to instruct the soldiers.
Ha!
...... I believe that the wife of Dunkirk[--] passed away <cf>a long time ago. ......
...... It's almost the anniversary of her death!
Every year, no matter how busy he is, Dunkirk visits her grave on the <cf> anniversary of her death.
He always brings <cf>something that she loved.
For more than 15 years now,...... he has been doing so,......
So you have cherished your wife. ......
Master Dunkirk still walks with his wife. <cf>I guess that thought will never fade away.
He will always have her in his heart. ......
You ......?
<cf>Thanks for your hard work in collecting the dye and delivering the gift. <cf> I will pay you your reward as promised.
<cf>Then I will take my leave. <cf>Best of luck to you all!
I'm not sure how to say it, but the more ...... capable a woman is, the more she reads the air and <cf>steps on her feet. ......
In some cases, it's a little ...... frustrating!
That's ......
Erlinse-sama, how about it [--]!
[--]!　Traces of avaritia!
Erlinse-sama is by my side! <cf>Senior staff, please check your surroundings!
Oh, oh!
......There is no sign of Avaltia as far as the eye can see, but what about the <cf>Omnistron?
There is a trace, but there is a reaction. <cf>It appears to be hanging around the street area!
......, but judging by the traces, it's not an <cf>avaritia that should be released.
Let's bypass the street from here so we don't run into each other.
What? ......?　Are you going to leave the avaritia <cf> as it is?
Yes, since she is not a target for liberation.
But, but, if she is near the road, isn't she a danger to <cf>other people? ......
That is a possibility. <cf>But there is no need for us to take action!
Oh no!　I don't want to <cf>turn a blind eye</cf> when we know there is a danger!
...... is not our role. <cf>We must avoid unnecessary fighting!
Besides, careless interference may affect the future!
But [--]
I will say it again. It is not our role. <cf>Please hear me out, Mr. Ehrinse.
Tirith......
Well, well, well. I'm sure we all have our points, <cf> but there's no use in arguing with each other here.
In the meantime, why don't you at least <cf>see what's going on in Avaritia?　It's too much trouble to go around the streets.
If it looks like it's safe to leave it alone,<cf>we can just pass by. Hmm?
Such a compromise is [--].
Tirith, a servant must listen to his master.
Senpai ......
Yes, yes!　Is that good?　Tirith. <cf>As long as you have a contract, you are a servant too!
...... understand. <cf>At any rate, I'm just going to check on you!
Alright!　Let's get going!
...... Um, thank you!
I don't see Avaritia in sight. ......
Erinse, please don't leave my side.
Tirith. If Erinse sticks to you any longer, <cf>you'd rather not be able to walk, wouldn't you?
......
Hey, you've been a little too tense since a while ago, haven't you?
You're making me tense to watch. <cf>You don't want to put unnecessary tension on your fellow man, do you?
I'm sorry ....... I had a bit of a bad feeling about this.
I know you're sensitive about the avaritia, but <cf>we're here too, so don't be so uptight.
Yes, Tirith. <cf>Don't take on too much alone: ......
My apologies. <cf>But I am Erinse's escort.
Even with the help of my seniors, <cf>I cannot let my guard down!
I am here <cf> only to protect Erinze-sama!
It seems that the relevant avaritia is no longer <cf>around here. Let's hurry on ahead.
...... Tirith, omnistron!
[--]!　Yes, sir!
What's up?　There's no sign of Aberritya around, but ......
This sign...... of Tirith's bad premonition may have been <cf>right</cf>!
What the ......?
Dear Erinse, this is ......<cf>Voldigen's trail!
After all, ......
The Dragon King! <cf> He was here?
Yes, he was here. These are the marks where Voldigen ate <cf>Abaritia</cf>!
Oh, hey, are you all right! <cf>If he's still around, this time we'll [--].
Calm down, please. <cf> Fortunately, there is no reaction from the Vordigen itself!
What about the reaction of the other avalitiers?
There is one a short distance from here.
From the tracks, ...... it appears that a Voldigen and <cf>two Avalitaires engaged here.
So one of them was eaten and the other one escaped. ......<cf>
......That one of them went to the road ahead?
Yes. It's still moving that way.
This can no longer be called a wait-and-see situation. <cf>We're going to make a quick detour!
<cf>Abaritia, who engaged the Dragon King, <cf>is probably in a state of excitement and out of control by now!
So, but the people on the street are ......!
...... In this case, we <cf>should</cf> defeat the fleeing avaritia!
Yes! <cf>Master, what you said earlier is not what you meant!
My apologies. <cf> But in a way, I think this could be an opportunity.
What?　What do you mean?
I explained to you that Voldigen is gaining <cf>strength ...... by eating avaritia, right?
There are levels of avaritia. <cf>There is no point in eating only small fry!
If Voldigen went out of his way to eat them, then <cf>the avaritia that escaped must be of a certain strength......
I can't just let him go and let Voldigen continue to build up his power.
I'll take him out before he tries again.
No, no, no!　Even if the Dragon King is not in sight, it is dangerous to approach a <cf>manhandled beast</cf>!
First of all, it is <cf>your</cf> duty to protect Erinse!
If Voldigen gains any more strength, he will not be able to protect Erinse in the near future!
It would be better to reduce his power here and now.
Nuh-uh. ...... You certainly have a point. ...... But... ......
I understand. I'll do as Tillis says.
I'll do as Tillis says. I'll do as Tillis says.
[--]Yeah, we don't have a choice! <cf> If this is how it's going to be, let's go take down Avaritia!
There she is!　It's Abaritia!
That Avaritia......<cf> seems even more formidable than I imagined......
Don't worry, I'll take care of it here!
Erlinse is in a safe place with the eagle! <cf>The servant is with Tirith in Avaritia!
Teyahhhh!
Tirith, you were very good!
Yes, yes, I've been trained, <cf> of course!
I'm more worried about Erinse-sama than that. <cf> Let's join them as soon as possible!
Tirith......!
I saw how you fought! <cf>That blow was a thing of beauty!
...... I am Master Erinse's escort.
Yes, I am<cf>so proud of you for being my escort. Because [--]
I was able to protect people on the <cf>road</cf> by defeating that avaritia!
...... That's a consequence. <cf>I was protecting Lady Erinse[--].
That's consequentialism. <cf>It saved a lot of lives.
So take heart in that fact, Tirith.
I'm <cf>so glad I trusted you and asked you to escort me to ......
Dear Erinse,......
......I am <cf>proud</cf> to be Master Erinse's escort!
Well, hmmm. <cf>We are so compatible, aren't we?
Oh, I can't believe we're in love with each other!　Such trepidation!
Uh, ...... sorry to interrupt your flirting, but <cf>shouldn't we be on our way?
Yes, yes!　Yes, I do! <cf>Yes, uh...[--]
What's up?
<cf>Thank you very much for lending me your help again, seniors of ......!
I'm a bit of a hard-head, so I apologize for any trouble I may cause you, but <cf>please keep up the good work!
Hmmm?　Well, I <cf>don't appreciate your love for your housemate who left us out of it, but I do appreciate the part where you thank us.
Well, now that we have one less thing to worry about, <cf>let's go to Salamzaat!
Oh. What a detour!
(...... even though I think I can do everything on my own, <cf>I still don't have enough power.)
(But there are people who can help me.)
(And there is the Lord who believes in me.)
(For their sake, <cf> I must fulfill my mission.)
(In the future, no matter what the cost [--]<cf>I will surely protect you, Erinse-sama!)
What is it, you two?　<cf> You're just standing there. <cf>Is the city so unusual?
Yes, it is. I've <cf>never taken the time to look closely at a large city of this time period. ......
It's much livelier than I imagined. <cf>The whole place is so lively!
Hmmm!　<cf>A city this big must be a rarity, even for those of the future.
Since we're here, how about I give you a <cf> tour of the city?　Hmm?
Well, is that alright with you?
Perhaps you'll charge me a <span size="Big">guide fee</span> later. ......
(You get the point. ......)
Tirith, you must not say such a thing. <cf>Mr. Feste said that out of the kindness of his heart.
Hey, Mr. Feste. Yes, I know.
Gosh, ......!　Innocent eyes gouge the heart......!
......?　What's wrong?
Gugu......Gununununununununununu......!
[--]Oh, God, I understand!　I won't take any money. <cf>Goodwill guide from the bottom of my heart!
Here you go, Tirith! <cf>Isn't that what I said?
<cf>I know you've been struggling with this in your heart, <cf>but if that's what you want, Feste, I'll indulge you.
<cf>I'll be lenient if that's what you want, Feste. <cf>All of you, including my servants, follow me!
From now on, the eternally beautiful Feste-chan is going to take you on a grand tour of <cf>Asterlys~!
I'm looking forward to your company!
First, let's go to the arena, the largest building in Asterleaze and a famous sightseeing spot!
This is the arena! <cf>Well, aren't you surprised at the size of this place?
This is the arena ......
Is this where you fight ......?
Yes! <cf>There are many skilled and fierce fighters here.
It is indeed <span size="Big">small</span>!
...... Yeah?
Yeah, and the building looks like it's going to collapse. <cf>Does it meet the standards for earthquake-resistant construction?
............ uh-huh?
It's hard for people in <cf>this age</cf> to have to fight in a place like this. ......
Will it last a few more decades......? <cf>Well, it's a historic building.
Oh, Tillis. Look at this more than that. <cf>Souvenirs!
A pennant with the name of the city on it and ...... is this a wooden sword? <cf>Is this what the city is famous for?
Hey, can't I take this home as a souvenir for everyone? <cf>As long as it's enough to take to the Chronogate, right?
Then we can buy everything around here [--].
<cf>Wait a minute! <cf>What's the matter with paying so much money for such a thing!
And you're ignoring the arena and getting carried away with the standard souvenirs! <cf> This pride of mine that guided you here will crumble!
But not the arena in particular: ......
I'm used to seeing huge structures. ......
...... I understand. I understand very well. As a beautiful girl who knows Asterlys well, I won't miss it this time.
Next is the town gate square!　I'm sure it will hit a chord with you guys over there!　Let's go!
How do you like it? <cf>You'll only find a sight like this in Asterlys!
Well, ......!
Wow, ......!
Behold this beautiful array of images! <cf>The legacy of the Buffalian civilization has been perfectly mastered[--]!
What a <span size="Big">dated system</span>!
And I can't believe it's still in use! <cf>I never dreamed that I could see it with my own eyes!
...... Oh?
Why does this only show flat images?
............ oh?
That's the way it is, Mr. Ehrinse. <cf>This is the limit of this system!
Well, ...... that's a huge inconvenience!
But it's great! <cf> I can't believe you're running something this old.
Thank you, Mr. Feste. <cf>This is a wonderful historical legacy [--].
Mr. Feste?　How can I help you?
<cf> You are from the future, aren't you? <cf>Of course, this stuff is too old to even talk about.
Defeated......!　<cf>I'm defeated...... for introducing the latest technology to people from the future with a smug look on my face!
Oh no!　I was impressed to see <cf>fossil-like technology that only remains in documents!
That's it! <cf>I'm calling our latest technology a fossil!
Huh?　Oh, uh, ......!
......I'm hungry. Wanna go to the market?
...... are you hungry? Wanna go to the market?
(Nice follow-up, senpai!)
Market?　Hmmm, there's nothing to show <cf> to people of the future anyway...
That's not true. Let's go!　The market! <cf> Right?　Both senpai and Erinse-sama!
Yes, I'm looking forward to it!　I'm looking forward to it!
Hmmm ......
(...... sulked)
(...... sulked)
(I totally sulked......)
...... Well, for now, the next one is the market~......
Yes, this is the market~......
What's the matter with you, you dunce? The future of Asterlys doesn't sell <cf>this old-fashioned stuff?
No...... that......, <cf>I was surprised to see how busy the market is......
Fresh vegetables and fruits are so much ....... <cf>It's like a dream. ......
Ehhh?　<span size="Big">Is such a thing</span> so rare?
In our time, the influence of avaritia <cf>has become so strong and intense ......
Fresh fruits and vegetables from the land are <cf>almost unheard of!
So what's going on with the food?
The general public is largely on a processed nutritional diet. <cf>They have almost no access to fresh food!
So, the sight of a marketplace like this, crowded with people, is <cf>very ...... in our time!
...... This planet was so rich, wasn't it? <cf>It wasn't just a fantasy in a book......
(...... how about the beach next time? <cf>I'm sure you two would love it.)
(Mm, yes. (Mm, yes. I'll take your suggestion.)
<cf>Next time, shut up and follow me! <cf>I'll show you a great place!
This is the blue ...... ocean ......!
Amazing ...... people are swimming ......!
Tirith, Tirith! <cf>Your feet are strange!　The water is closing in!
Watch out!　Be careful [--]It's cold!
...... Wow, it's salty! <cf>Seawater is really mixed with salt. ......
Don't drink it, don't drink it. <cf>You'll be thirsty afterwards, okay?
Mr. Feste!　What is that!
It's a fish. You saw them at the market earlier. <cf>They taste good when freshly caught, don't they?
You're going to eat it? <cf>Well, you can find it at ......!
Hey, you two! <cf>Don't go too far!
Not at all,<cf> ...... servants, did you see the two of them frolic? <cf>As if they were children seeing the sea for the first time.
By the looks of it, perhaps the ocean of the future will be ......
The future or ....... <cf>This suddenly seems very real. ......
...... Oh, they're back!
Feste, senior. <cf>Thank you for today!
This is the first time we have been in contact with the real sea!
In our time, <cf>the ocean was also contaminated by avaritia ......
In our time, <cf>we still have beautiful blue seas left!
...... We must not lose this color. Never.
In order to preserve this blue, I will surely <cf> accomplish the liberation of Avaritia!
Yes, we must ......!
The future of the ...... planet, huh?
Hey, I'm a little curious, <cf>isn't this cathedral quite a mess?
Shells[--]No, not the [mitsuka], but <cf>those monsters in the aisles,......
...... If these are the questions of God's chosen ones, <cf>I must answer them.
This cathedral was originally bequeathed by the god of Buffalia.
Long ago, our god was at war with the dragon tribe. <cf>There are traces of this in these ruins.
<cf>Anyone other than the god of Buffalia and his followers would be attacked by the wrath of the gods.
Ah!　[The same structure as the Mihashira.
......?　[Have you ever been in the Mihashira?
Well, there was a <cf>report that the inside of the [mihashira] was badly vandalized before. ......
No, no?　I only heard about it from a member of the congregation. <cf>Now, never mind, keep talking.
...... Anyway, the remains of God have left us with this mechanism to <cf>eliminate</cf> the enemy!
However, <cf>"Wrath" was not triggered when God's "messenger" appeared!
At that time, the messenger was sleeping peacefully, and there was no need to put up a <cf>warding</cf>, but something happened to him.
<cf>Something must have offended the [mitsuka]ini. <cf>Suddenly he became very angry and attacked us.
[As if in concert with the angel, the wrath of God was also triggered, forcing us to evacuate the cathedral.
<cf>Master Einlein was to quell the [messenger] from here by setting up a ward.
I see. ......
If you set up a ward at a location far from the target, <cf>you will expend extra power to do so.
Einlein-sama is no exception, <cf>he is more tired than he looks.
Even though you have made it possible for me to ward beside the messenger thanks to your help, I'm sure that the accumulation of energy up to now has been considerable.
It would be terrible if Einlein were to fall. <cf>Can't you do something about it?
We have been asking him to take a medicine specially made by the Order to help alleviate his fatigue, but we are running out of raw materials for that medicine.
But we are running out of raw materials for that medicine as well. ......
<cf>I think we are the right people for the job. <cf>We are quite capable of gathering raw materials, aren't we?
Yes, leave it to us.
<cf>You are indeed God's chosen ones. <cf>We thank you for your spirit of service.
<cf>As for the whereabouts of the raw materials, there is a member of our congregation who is well versed in pharmacology, so please ask him.
I am sure he is in the vicinity of the temple in Asterlys, observing the flowers and plants.
Well, then, my servant. We will go to the temple as soon as possible.
You are the one that Lugerio was talking about, the layman who is familiar with pharmacology?
Well, I guess I'll have to answer that. Hey!
Shush!　...... I can't hear the grass and flowers!
Yes?
The wind rustles...... the leaves rub against each other...... the veins ripple......<cf> hear... ...the dance of grass and flowers......
Poemer!
I just ...... tell ...... the breath of the grass and flowers. <cf> that green voice......
Nah, he's got a habit ......!
Yeah, okay, let's keep it clerical. <cf> Orders from your boss, Lugerio.
We are looking for raw materials to make the Order's special medicine. <cf>Please tell us what you need.
Medicine...... that will save people...... hope......
(Patience, Eagle!　Come on!!!)
What we need now is "Oil of Skyfish"......<cf>When oil and honey mix...... the flower of life blooms......
Did you hear that, servants?　Did you hear that?　Now you've done your business. <cf>Let's go get some raw materials!
The medicine...... it is a light...... that draws out the power of ...... people. <cf>Please be careful when using it......
You have foraged the raw materials. <cf>Thank you!
Let us accept them respectfully. <cf>Blessings of the Gods of Buffalia upon you all.
The congregation you mentioned that is familiar with pharmacology, <cf>you have a crazy habit of doing that. ......
My apologies. <cf>Even that one is an excellent apothecary.
Let's have that one make the medicine as soon as possible. <cf>I'm sure he's finished gathering the ingredients over there too.
Hmm?　Isn't this the only ingredient?
We need several other kinds of medicinal herbs. <cf>But some of them are poisonous.
He identifies those and <cf>collects the necessary medicinal herbs all by himself!
You weren't just a poet. ......
Now, please wait here for a moment. <cf>I will bring you some medicine. ......
This will be the Order's special medicine. <cf>Please give it to Master Einlein.
I don't mind, but why don't you go and give it to him?
I have some business to attend to.
I see. ...... Then we will take this medicine to <cf>Einlein.
Yes, we will. Thank you very much.
Hey, I brought the medicine. Can you get some rest?
I rewired it a while ago, so you can rest now. ......
I'll take your medicine............
I know it looks like a lot of work, but I'm sure you'll do your best. ......
But now that I'm closer to the [mitsuka], it's a lot easier than <cf>before......
...... By the way, Einlein. <cf>About Carveen,......
...... Shh. In a small voice.
I've met <cf>Cartoum was the last time I met Carveine in person. ......
I see, I see, we and Kaltoum are in the same boat. I see, so it's still the same <cf> meeting in Kartoum with us.
Well, if I hadn't, I wouldn't have been able to <cf>borrow</cf> the chronogram from Charlotte. ......
Oh, no, it's nothing. <cf>So, have you finished your pilgrimage?
Pilgrimage?　Pilgrimage, I haven't yet ......
Because I was here warding and attending <cf>Salamzat's talks: ......
The meeting?　Sorry, a little more detail there.
Salamzart's meeting: ...... an urgent four-way meeting between Barnhardt, Salamzart, <cf>Asterlys, and the Order: ......
With the assassination of the Duke, Dunkirk took real power: ...... <cf>Saying that the future of the Principality will be explained to the nations: ......
A meeting was held in Salamzat, a neutral place,......
...... you have been in contact with <cf>Carveine behind the scenes?
....... <cf>It was dangerous, but he's innocent......
......Mmm, yes, I agree. I agree. <cf>Carveen is a foolish and serious man.
...... I can't wait to get him out of suspicion.
<cf>We'll help as much as we can. <cf>He helped me with Charlotte, and
We, too, will help as much as we can. <cf>And he saved Charlotte for us.
Thanks ....... It's reassuring to hear you say that.
I'll do my best to put up the wards. <cf>I'll definitely keep [Mitsuka] here at bay. ......
<cf>Yes, that's the spirit! <cf>But don't overdo it, okay?
Yes. ......
<cf>Well, then, we'd better get back. <cf>Because we have to report to Lugerio.
I've given Einlein some medicine. <cf>And now I'm getting some rest.
Thank you. <cf>Are you feeling better, Mr. Einlein?
Oh, I'm perfectly motivated!
I see. <cf> I am glad I asked for your medicine after all.
By the way, you refused to <cf>take them with you, saying you had some business to attend to[--].
...... I am in charge of scolding you, Einlein-sama.
I am sure you will be even more tired <cf>if I visit you when you are tired.
In times like these, it is better to have people like yourselves who can <cf>talk light-heartedly</cf>.
...... for Einlein, I see.
Yes, she is an important oracle priestess.
Good grief, they're all clumsy. ......
Hey, Jake! <cf>Are you running the Coin Pavilion?
Let me ask you the opposite. Do I look like I'm doing it?
Well, it looks like you're having a hard time getting it right.
I'm just about there, to tell you the truth!
I'm on the edge! I have to keep inventory of liquor and food, check purchase routes, <cf>clean, wash dishes, mediate with drunks, and ......
Even if I were top of the line, <cf>this is too much for me to handle!
I can't even tease him about this. ...... <cf>Anything I can do to help?
<span size="Big">What! </>
<span size="Big">What! <cf>I have some attachment to it.
<cf>I wouldn't want it to go out of business while you're gone.
That's what I like about you. Feste's girl!
Ugh, no. I've lost all interest in helping out!
Don't say that. I need you to stock up for now. <cf>I'm in urgent need of something right now.
What I want is "Salamzat's special spices" and <cf>"Litze herbs" from the village of Litze.
If you could go and get these two things from the local merchants, <cf>that would be a huge help.
Yes, I'll take care of it.
Yes, I'll take care of it.
Thank you!
Sorry, it's from Coin Pavilion. <cf>I'm here to pick up Salamzaat's special spices!
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I've been worried about you, since you haven't been in touch lately.
Here you go, spices for this month. Take good care of them.
I may be a little <cf>inflexible</cf> from now on. ......
Barnhart. <cf>They've been putting a little pressure on our trading relationships.
He seems to be <cf>pushing us pretty hard not to do business with the Order in particular.
You see, the cult has a lot of influence in Asterlys, doesn't it? <cf>We don't know what's going to happen now.
Since the assassination of the Prince and Dunkirk's ascension to the top, <cf>they've become very, very hard-line.
Salamzart has remained neutral, but <cf> how will this turn out? ......
Oops, I'm getting a little gloomy here. <cf>Business should be fun. Thanks again!
Sorry, it's from Coin Pavilion. <cf>I'm here to pick up some Litze Herb!
<cf>Hey, you're not the usual guy. <cf>What's up with your dad?
He's been on a little trip. ...... <cf>A substitute is running the place now.
<cf>I was hoping to see your father's face for the first time in a long time.
Look, it's Ritze's pride and joy, Ritze Herb. <cf>Take it with you, I've prepared the usual amount.
Thank you very much. Certainly!
...... You guys are adventurers, right? <cf>You're traveling all over, aren't you?
Then, you know, haven't you heard about <cf>the anomaly in the Order within Barnhart?
An anomaly in the Order within Barnhart......? <cf>What's that?
No, I only heard about it from a fellow merchant. <cf>Something about everything being suppressed or something: ......
But the spooky thing is, this is <cf>not<cf> rumored at all in Asterlys!
Well, Asterlys is a free trading city, but <cf>the cult's influence is strong, you know. Maybe that's part of it.
Do you know anything else about ......?
Yeah, I know. Oh, ...... there is a story that Carveen, the knight who assassinated the king, is connected to the cult.
If that's the case, doesn't it make sense why Carveen fled to us?
If that's the case, then the assassination of the Prince was the work of the Order ....... <cf>[--]What a mess!　Well, it's all gossip.
Well then, give my regards to the surrogate husband. <cf>I hope he's a good-looking father.
Great! You brought our stock in one piece. <cf>Thank you!
Now all that's left to do is to prepare this according to <cf>your father's secret recipe</cf>.
You know, Jake. I haven't paid much <cf>attention to it, but ......
In the last few months, <cf>relationships between countries have started to get tense......?
Hmm?　Yeah,...... the international situation has definitely become <cf>stronger</cf>.
(After all, it seems <cf> different from the history we know. ......)
Perhaps adventurers will be called upon <cf>in terms of force</cf> in the future!
In anticipation of this, I've been seeing more and more <cf>ruder guys</cf> in Asterlys.
...... war, you say?
I don't know, honestly. But [--]
I think we mustn't lose this place of relaxation for that reason.
You ...... think so much about it. ......
Hu...... well. And [--].
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
You ...... think about that ......
HAHAHA! There's nothing that top of the line Jake can't <cf>do!　Get your customers and your girlfriends, man!
In a way, I'm relieved you haven't changed ......
Oh, you guys are ....... <cf>An acquaintance of Char's, I believe?
I am the head of the troupe that employs her. Thank you for helping <cf>Charl on that occasion.
At the time, that ...... you guys are quite close to <cf>Charles?
I don't know him too personally, but <cf>we have helped and been helped several times!
I see. Well, let's see: ......
Do you know the whereabouts of that girl ......?
That's ...... sorry, <cf>we don't have the details either ......
I see. No, please don't worry about it. <cf>I'm sorry to ask such a strange question.
Have you heard from Charlotte?
No, I haven't. Nothing since the attack by those strange people. <cf>I just left a note saying I'm going away for a bit: ......
...... I'm worried about that girl because she always keeps to herself<cf>.
The reason she left us must have been because she was worried <cf>that a member of the group had been injured because she was targeted.
I wonder if he is really safe now. ...... <cf> Are they eating properly......
As a parental surrogate, I'm so worried about him. ...... Ugh. ......
Um, I think they are probably fine. <cf>Because someone we know should be working with them.
What?　What?
As I said before, I don't know where they went, but <cf>Charlotte is with someone she trusts!
So don't worry too much [--].
Well, then, perhaps <cf>you guys can get in touch with Char!
Huh?　Well, well, <cf> maybe you can ......?
If so, please do! <cf>Please go and find out how Char is doing!
I <cf>understand</cf> that she is keeping her distance from us. Then at least let me know how he's doing [--].
(I can't be so careless when she's so worried about us. ...... <cf>Wouldn't it be nice to at least let him know how he's doing?)
(If you ask Einlein, you can at least <cf>contact him. ......)
(<cf>I can at least contact Einlein. ) Leave it to me.
Oh, thank you!　Thank you very much! <cf>I'll have to go tell my wife as soon as possible!
You are a good troupe leader. <cf>I'm sure the troupe is truly like a family.
Then I must at least tell her how it's going.
Let's go to the "Seido of Heaven's Blessing. <cf> We must consult Einlein.
<cf> I need to talk to Einlein. <cf>I have a question for you.
...... What is it?
<cf>Concerning Charlotte, <cf>is it possible to get in touch with her?
The leader of the troupe that took care of Charlotte is very worried about him.
I thought I'd at least <cf>let him know if he's doing well. ......
...... in that case.
<cf>Come back in two days. <cf>I'll take your letter. ......
Oh!　You asked for it. See you in two days.
And two days later......
You said you got a letter from Charlotte!
Give it to the troupe leader. <cf> Charlotte is also ...... very worried about you, so ......
Oh, leave it to me. <cf>I'll make sure it gets there!
All right, servant. Let's hurry up to Salamzaat!
Thank you for your patience. <cf>Here's a letter from Charlotte.
Oh ......!　Thank you very much!
You, read it quickly!　Here!
Wait, don't be in such a hurry. <cf>Which one? ...... Oh, that's definitely Char's handwriting!
Uh, ......<cf><cf><cf>< Dear troupe of troupe members,......>
<cf>How are you? <cf><cf>I'm sorry for my sudden departure.
<cf>I'm sure you're worried about me. ...... <cf> But don't worry. <cf> But don't worry, I'm very well! <cf>
<cf> I went on this trip because I was happy to see someone I know. <cf>I thought I'd like to spend a little more time with you. ......
<cf>So, really, don't worry. <cf>I'm having a great time.
<cf>I'll be traveling a little more for now,......, <cf> but I'm sure I'll get back to you guys.
<cf>When I do, I'll bring you lots of goodies. <cf>Let's party together! >
<[--]I'm sorry for being such a selfish girl. <cf> To my favorite family. Charlotte>
Charl......
I'm glad to hear you're doing well ....... <cf> That's all I can say for now: ......
Thank you. <cf>It's a relief to know how she's doing.
I guess he is trying not to let us worry about him. <cf>He seems to be working hard and having fun ......
...... That child has no real parents. <cf>Originally an abandoned child, he came to the troupe when he was 10 or so.
Since then, we have raised her <cf>as if she were our own daughter.
But we also know that she longs to meet her <cf>real</cf> parents.
We want to make that dream come true somehow, but <cf>she's just so stubborn. ......
[Anyway, I'm going to leave it up to her to decide for now.
I agree. She would never do anything wrong.
Yeah, we are so proud of her.
Thank you so much for this time. <cf>This is not much, but please accept our thanks!
Now, we will leave you with this. <cf>We would like to show the letter to the others: ......
A good family, even if not blood related.
...... family, huh? ......
<cf>We are not related, since we are not sure of our memories. <cf>Well, it can't be helped!
Hey! You look kind of bored, don't you? <cf>No, I must be bored. I'm sure you are.
<cf> Well, that's a strong current, isn't it? <cf> Is there something you need help with?
I'm in a bit of a pickle.
This is a problem I have with the <cf>top of the top</cf> adventurers in Asterlys. ......
Ah yes, yes. <cf>So, enough with the smugness, let's get on with it.
As it turns out, <cf>I need you to take care of my request.
Due to the fact that I'm currently away from here, <cf>I'm reducing the number of requests from the Pioneering Bureau: ......
I've been asked by a client who doesn't know that <cf>"I really need you, Jake," <cf>and I've done everything in my power to make that happen.
<cf>All because of my talent. <cf>Oh, I hate my talent. ......
[So, I'd like you guys to take the job for me.
I'm sure the client would be happy to have a junior associate that I have my eye on.
...... Well, if that's the case.
<cf>I'm sure the fee will be reasonable if it's addressed to you. <cf>And I'll be grateful to you for taking care of this place.
Thank you!
<cf>The client is Priest Wahlkin of Minsterhorn.
That noisy priest. <cf>Has he gone missing again?
You're not far off the mark. <cf> The one who went missing was his apprentice, Myrlene, but...
Myrlene ....... <cf>Oh, there was a female apprentice with glasses, as I recall. That one.
You know her?　Then it's a quick story!
That apprentice hasn't been back for <cf>six days now</cf> from her search for the "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon.
[<cf>Mr. Wahlkin was worried because he said he would be back in a couple of days.
The master was missing before, and now the apprentice? <cf>They are similar, aren't they? ......
<cf>Most likely, like the master, his curiosity got the better of him and he was blind to his surroundings.
I am personally indebted to Priest Wahlkin. <cf>I would like to ask you to do one thing for me!
Good, you asked. <cf>We are no strangers to the priests.
<cf> Then, my servants, let us go in search of Myrlene!
Is this the back where Myrlene was said to have disappeared: ......
......?　Servant. <cf>Did you hear any voices just now?
Was I mistaken?　But [--]
I am not mistaken. Something is happening! <cf> Hurry, servant!
Servant, do you recognize these broken glasses?
I believe these glasses are ......
<cf>Mr. Milleyne!
...... well, they must belong to Myrlene. <cf>And there are traces of blood around ......
Then she ...... can't be ...... sure!
I'd like her to be alive, emotionally, but <cf>that would be difficult under the circumstances. ......
Such ......
...... such things happen in the adventurer's life.
I'm going back to the coin pavilion with my glasses. <cf>I'll have to report this to Jake. ......
...... I see. <cf>I thought it was the sound of the wind through the gap.
I thought it was a scream or something.
Hey! <cf>Did you find Myrlene?
...... if only for the broken glasses.
Is that ......
...... Oh, right. That's what I meant, huh?
Sorry, I've turned in a bad request. <cf> I'll explain it to the priest.
Sorry about that.
<cf>Don't get me started on the Feste girl being all saucy.
Just ...... sorry, but I need you to explain the situation in detail. <cf>I also have to report to the Pioneering Bureau.
Oh, yes. First of all [--]
Excuse me!　Jake, are you there?
Huh?
Oh?
Oh ......!
It's like the doctor got impatient and asked them to search for me. <cf>I'm so sorry!
<span size="Big">I'm alive! </>
What?　Yes, I'm alive? <cf>I'm alive and well today, and I've had a good breakfast?
That's good for you, why not ......! <cf> Oh, you, here, broken glasses!　In the ruins!
Oh, you guys picked them up? <cf>Thanks!　But I made new ones.
A new one ......?
Yeah. Well, this time I was really overwhelmed. <cf>I fell down in the ruins and broke my glasses.
Do you know the feeling of despair when a nearsighted person loses his glasses? <cf>And my nose was bleeding from the blow on my face. It was really painful.
So I asked a passing adventurer to bring me to <cf>Asterlys</cf>.
But I couldn't do anything without my glasses, right? <cf> So I stayed cooped up until I could get new ones.
Uh ......, and in the meantime, a priest, worried that he hadn't heard from me, <cf>sent a request to me, and I was able to get a new pair.
It seems so. I am so sorry. <cf>Dr. Sensei is in trouble for worrying too!
Hah...... I'm glad you're safe, but <cf>you, I can't speak for Wahlkin!
If you don't want to worry, <cf>don't go exploring alone in the future!
<cf>Do you know how we felt when we found these broken glasses?　Hmm?
U...... know, I know. And as a result, we're wasting our time. <cf>I'm sorry ...... I should have contacted you first ......
From now on, I will try not to go exploring alone. <cf>...... as much as possible, you know.
From the sound of it, it doesn't sound like you're going to <cf>stop</cf> exploring alone, does it?
Of course not!　I won't <cf>stop</cf> until I solve the mystery of the super-ancient civilization!
A super-ancient civilization or ....... <cf>Is it different from the Buffalian civilization?
Super-ancient civilization, yes. ...... <cf>Is it different from the Buffalian civilization again?
<span size="Big">Well said! </>
Oh, I feel like I've hit <cf>an unwanted switch on this one, don't I?
You know what a stratum is?　Strata. It's <cf>essential</cf> for doing history. The higher up you are, the newer you are.
If we go by this, there is evidence of a civilization in the strata about 15,000 years before the ruins of <cf>Bafaria.
There are traces of a civilization that existed about 15,000 years before the <cf>Bafaria ruins. And there are traces of a civilization that was far more advanced<cf>than today, or rather, so advanced that we cannot even comprehend it.
There are traces of a civilization that was far more advanced than today's, or even incomprehensible. Yes, for example, these glasses!　The same shape has been found in the stratum, isn't that amazing!
Well, it seems that the super-ancient ones were more sophisticated. <cf>It seems that they had a lot of ingenuity, especially in the lenses.
Hey ...... how long is this going to last ......?
It's about the same as the Warkin and ...... can't ......
Oh,...... yeah,...... I see,......
Hey, are you listening?　So, the lens, <cf> apparently there's some kind of device that allows the image to float directly on the lens.
Oh, wow.
Wow, that's great.
<cf> What are you taking seriously? <cf>I'm afraid I'm going to have to explain further [--].
Right?　Isn't it great?　And this super-ancient civilization had a system where everything worked automatically.
I'll take care of the rest. <cf>Goodbye!
Don't run away!　Take me with you! <cf>No, please take me with you, Jake!
Don't call me "sir" just at a time like this!　I'm running away!
And so, so, so...[--]!
<span size="Big">Help me! </>
You're going to kill a demi-dragon, aren't you?
You mean the one that's out in the Asteria Plains? <cf>I'll pass. Impossible, impossible. Are you going?
I'll pass too. I can't, I can't, I can't. <cf>I hear quite a few of them are getting turned around.
That's right. No matter how big the reward for success is, <cf>life is more important.
These requests should be left to the good guys. <cf>...... see, if you speak of the rumors...
Oh, that's the rumored ......!
Hmmm, what is it? <cf>They're glancing at us.
Well, I can understand why you might be tempted to look. <cf>There are not many girls as beautiful as me.
<cf>It's a good thing I'm a beautiful girl with a big heart who can tolerate impolite glances. Hohoho!
Those two were called demi-dragons, weren't they?
They said demi-dragons, didn't they?
Mm, I heard you say the rewards are pretty good too. <cf>What do you think?　Would you like to go and test your skills as well?
Rumors about you seem to be spreading in a good way, too. <cf>Let's make a name for ourselves again here and give it a boost!
The more famous you become, the easier it may be to <cf>obtain clues to your memory.
<cf>Once that's decided, let's get to work. <cf>Let's go kill the demi-dragons!
Excuse me. I <cf> heard that there are demi-dragons around here. ......
<cf>Did you come here to slay it by any chance? <cf>That's too bad then.
We've already killed the demi-dragons. <cf>...... we were just watching too.
Eh?　Was anyone very strong?
Strong ...... or rather ......<cf>what was that?
......Mmmm. It's like I was dreaming.
Uh ......? <cf>I'd like to know more about it if I could.
<cf>It was a boy who defeated a demi-dragon. <cf>It suddenly flew out of the sky [--].
<cf>What the hell kind of magic is that? <cf>What on earth kind of magic did he use?
......What kind of boy was he?
He was a beautiful boy. <cf>But ...... I wonder if he was a little scary or ......
As soon as he saw us, he said ["]no qualities[,]" and <cf>he immediately flew away!
I wonder what kind of Imagine Seed that thing uses. <cf> I can't believe it can fly. ......
...... servant. A boy is a boy if you will:......
...... Merlouf.
Um, do you know where the boy went? <cf> Just the direction.
Then it's that direction. <cf> No guarantee we'll see him, though.
<cf> Good. Let's go after him, my servant!
We have found them!　It was you who slayed the demi-dragon. <cf> You're stealing our reward!
That's a terrible thing to say as soon as I saw you. <cf> I didn't slay it for the reward.
Then why?
...... because everyone was in trouble?
Wow - that sounds like a great lie. <cf>If you're going to lie, why don't you tell a more decent lie?
That's mind-boggling. It's not a lie, though. <cf>It's my role to help people.
...... Well, okay. We met here, but it's been 100 years. <cf>We'll let you tell us who you are!
Yes, I do. <cf>I'll tell you, but I'd like ...... a consideration.
Consideration?　Or money?
I don't <cf>hate</cf> your thought process of tying everything to money, but it's not the right answer.
The price I'm looking for is [--]"strength".
Strength ......?
Yeah. I have a propensity to favor strong people. <cf>Show me your strength and I'll answer your question.
I don't want to be asked to show my strength all of a sudden. ...... <cf>Would you like to do push-ups here?　Mainly the servants.
That would be fun, but I'd rather see a real fight anyway.
For now, [--]I guess so. <cf> Why don't you try to beat "Pink Uribo"?
Excuse me?　You want us to fight for nothing to find out who you are?
We won't force you to do anything.　You can refuse. <cf> But in that case[--].
I simply <cf>think</cf> you guys were 'up to it'.
Hoho...... are you trying to provoke me? <cf> Interesting. I'm in.
Go, my servant!　Let <cf>this impudent little brat know<cf> how strong you and I are!
Ha-ha-ha. I'm counting on you. Good luck.
Well, I beat him, just like you ordered!
...... Really?
Hmm?　I'm surprised you doubt me.
Really, is that your power?　It can't be. ...... <cf> Shouldn't you make him feel a little more threatened? ......
What are you mumbling about? <cf>Anyway, I promise. You may tell us who you are.
No.
I told you.　Show me your strength and I'll answer your questions. <cf> I have yet to see your strength.
If you want to hear the answer, <cf> you'll have to defeat "Iron Fang" next!
What, what the hell?　You fraud!
No matter what you say, I won't <cf>answer</cf> your questions unless they match what I want!
Unnnnnnnnnnnn......!
[--]Yeah, yeah!　I can't end up looking like a fool! <cf>Yes, I will, my servant!
How about this, now you're ready to talk!
...... why?
What now?　What now?
You're not letting your power get the better of you, are you? <cf> You need to show more of your value.
Value ......?
<cf>You can do it, can't you? <cf>You can do it, right?
That being said: ......
If it were just strength, I'd be fine with any adventurer out there.
But you are not. <cf>That's why I'm facing you like this.
If you don't understand that, then I guess my help ends here.
You can't go to ......!
......I want you to look at it again!
......I want you to look at it again!
...... okay. However, this is the last time. <cf>Slay the "Trick Elder".
Well, I'm afraid I'm going off on my own, but <cf>If you insist on doing it, then I have no choice.
This time, we will show <cf>the little clichéd man</cf> just how strong we are!
How's ...... this time?
...... I guess that's about as good as it gets. <cf>I wouldn't say you're showing your worth.
Oh, oh, oh!　You did it, my servant!
You know what?　This is not your real power. <cf>You need to utilize your Imagines more.
Listen to the Imagins. <cf> Not as tools, but as friends who fight together. ......
Friends?
That's right. Imagine Seeds are crystals of will. <cf>The thoughts of the people are contained in it.
<cf>You can feel those feelings better than most people. <cf>Because that's who you are.
What, I don't understand. ......
Oh, I guess it's a little early for that.
By the way, I promise!　If you get a good grade, it means you <cf>got the right one. Answer our questions!
Yes, I do. <cf>Now, just one thing about who I am.
<cf>I am not a chronoleap. <cf>The present me and the future me you've met are one and the same.
Oh, ......?
...... No, wait. So you will still be alive in <cf>that</cf> form a thousand years from now......?
Eternally beautiful boy, I guess.
Oh, my!　Don't take my sales pitch!
No, no, that's not the point. <cf> Are you subhuman?　My lifespan is [--].
I'll see you later.
Ah!　Holy shit, wait. Don't fly away! <cf> Don't wait for me!
[--]Gnununuuuuuu, you escaped again! <cf>After you've only deepened the mystery!
......The voice of Imagineers, huh?
It's enough to be a hero's quality.
But whether they will blossom or not is an unknown area,......<cf> I guess.
......Hey, Adelaide. <cf>What do you think......?
Mr. Ehrinse, I think it's time for you to get ready to leave.
......Yes, we should. We need to get to [kamigakari] [mihashira] as soon as possible.
I'm sure you have something to tell me.
I can't keep secrets from you.
I wanted to see ...... the sea. <cf>Before I go back to my original time, at least a glimpse.
I'm sorry. Now is not the time<cf> to be so leisurely.
Senpai, I would like to ask you to do the same. <cf>Please let me go to the sea before you go to [Mihashira].
Tirith?　Are you sure?
I wanted to see the sea too. <cf>I wanted to see the richness of the sea in this time period with my own eyes: ......
If that's the case, Asterlys would be a good choice. <cf>The beach there is a tourist attraction.
Yes, that's right!　And while we're at it, let's get hungry. <cf>Salamuzat's food is too spicy for me.
Thank you very much. <cf>...... really, thank you!
<cf>The sea in Asterlys is a first class tourist attraction. <cf>It's always beautiful!
Yes, it is. It's so beautiful.
Both the sky and the sea ...... are really beautiful ......
Now, let's go and have a bite to eat!
<cf>You can wait here while I and my servants get you something suitable.
No, if that's what you want, I can [--].
Good, good. I'm the one who knows best about the delicacies of Asterlys.
<cf>Let's go, my servant. <cf>Your destination is the Coin Pavilion.
Delicious food takeout for four!　Hurry up!
Yes, sir. And this is on the bill too?
I'll pay for it.
No, not you. I'll pay this time.
[--]!　Phantom ......!
Are you okay?　Did you eat something bad? <cf> Or did you hit your head?　Are you still dreaming?
What is it with you two? <cf> I don't run away from food all year round!
Well, besides, I have something else to ask you this time.
What is it, something other than food?
Well, ...... lend me your ears for a moment.
...... Actually, it's ......, but it's ............. <cf>probably ...... at ......
...... on the beach ......, can't you help me out with your contacts?
...... I see. <cf>I'll have food ready in a minute. <cf>I'll get you some food soon, eat it and wait for me on the beach.
Oh, and take good care of him.
That's a secret, even from you. Well, look forward to it.
Well, after you get your food, we'll head back to the beach!
How are you enjoying the beach?
Yes, thanks to you.
That's great. <cf>Here, I bought you some food. Go ahead and eat.
Thank you very much. Well, it looks delicious ......!
Mr. Ehrinse, here's a hand towel for you.
Thank you. I'm so thrilled to have food outside while looking at the ocean for the <cf>first</cf> time!
Hmmm, me too!
Even Tirith is boxed in. ...... <cf> I guess a nobleman's attendant is also a nobleman.
...... boxed. Well, yes.
I thought I <cf>knew</cf> this planet by knowledge alone!
The world I actually saw in this time period was so big, <cf>so colorful, and had so many different smells ......
<cf>Well, I was bothered by the winds. <cf>But that's why--
<cf>I can now truly understand your desire to protect this planet, Mr. Erlinse.
I, too, want to protect this planet. The people who live on this planet.
...... To do so, <cf>I must go back to the future.
I've come to <cf>think that way now that I've met both of you!
I've come to <cf> strongly want to protect it because of the future that ...... Feste-san and my seniors are building!
Tillis is right.
After landing here and meeting many people, <cf>I too have stronger feelings. But ......
If I could, I would have been ...... nothing, but I wanted to be born with <cf>you</cf> in this time. ......
Hey, look at that!
Fireworks......!
I don't know whose whim it is, but the timing is good. <cf> Let's watch the fireworks for a while!
...... Ah!
(I was asking my husband to ......!)
...... A little surprise!
...... beautiful!
The fireworks reflected in the sea,...... it's like a dream,......
...... I will <cf> never forget this sight I saw with my seniors!
No matter what, never......
Erinze. I need to talk to you about something I'm about to do.
Erinze. I'd like to talk to you about what we're going to do.
Erlinse?　Can you hear me?
............ Tirith ......
Hey there, Erinze!
Kya!
What is it?　Don't be so surprised! <cf> You startled me!
I'm sorry. I was just thinking about something.
...... hmm?
...... I heard a metallic sound just now,<cf> did you drop something?
What ......?　Ah!　Omnistron is gone! <cf> Oh no, what should I do?
Calm down! <cf>If you're in a hurry, you won't find what you're looking for
But...
Oh, look, at my feet: ......
At your feet?　Ah[--]
............
<span size="Big">I stepped on it! </>
What should I do? <cf>Packing!　A puckering sound!
Oh, oh, oh, calm down!　Look carefully! <cf>We haven't decided it's broken yet!
Yes, I'm sure it is. <cf>I'll have to check to see if it starts up properly: ......
Okay, I'll start ......
...... how's it looking?
...... no good, it looks like. <cf> Or rather, no. ......
Oops... ....... <cf>What am I supposed to do without Tirith? ......
Go back to the future for once? <cf>But it's not so easy to chronoleap[--].
...... I'll fix it for you.
What?　You can do that?
In a manner of speaking. Before I came to this time period, <cf>I learned the repair procedure with Tirith.
Even if I were to be alone, I would still be able to manage ...... and
Tirith said ["]even if I did, I wouldn't let that happen["], <cf> but...
Oh ......
Oh, that was the time, wasn't it? <cf>When I tried to be funny and put my hands on her [--]]
Tirith ["]Erinse-sama mustn't do any repairs["]<cf> and was concerned about my hand......
...... and that's how Tirith always <cf>did a lot of things. I just watch her do it.
Yes, I <cf>did. Even when I decided to come to this time period, <cf>it was Tirith who made all the arrangements!
I <cf> just say what I want to do ......
Well, well, don't be so hard on yourself. <cf>You are of noble birth. It can't be helped.
<cf>But that is no longer the case. <cf>Now I must do it!
I'm sorry, but could you <cf>help</cf> me gather parts for repairs?
I would like to say that I can do this myself ......, but <cf>as I said, I'm not sure I can do it alone.
Thank you very much! <cf>So, let's get started looking for parts as soon as possible!
<cf>You can get the parts you need from "Pridok" here, right?
Yes. Thank you for your help, sir.
I don't have the strength to fight, but <cf>I will support you as much as I can.
I'm counting on you.
Yes, sir!　Then, let's go!
You got the parts without incident. <cf>You did a great job, Erinze.
Thank you very much. <cf>But I must work hard from now on.
Let's go back to the temple in Asterleaze. <cf>Because there, we can calmly make repairs.
Then we will move on to repairing the omnistron. <cf>We will need a little time.
<cf>Oh, I leave the rest to you. <cf>Good luck!
<cf>Yes, sir. I'll fix it, I promise.
I said ......, but it's okay. <cf>I wonder if you can repair the machine.
I'll wait with faith. It will be all right.
Let's wait and believe. It will be all right.
You are a positive person, aren't you? <cf>Well, that's what saves me, too.
Thank you for your patience. <cf>The Omnistron is ready for repair!
Oh, you did it!
I was puzzled at first, but <cf>once I figured out how it worked[--]there you go!
Oh - it really is fixed. ......
That's great, Erinze!
That's great, Erinze.
Thank you very much. <cf> Actually, I made a few modifications as well!
Hmm?　Modifications?
Yes. Like this [--].
<span size="Big">Huge! </>
What do you think? <cf>Don't you think it's easier to see the text this way?
No, you can see too much!
Recently, Bashraal was feeling a bit presbyopic, so <cf>I thought it would be helpful to have this kind of functionality!
Ummm...so kind! <cf> But that kindness, I don't need it now!
Later, there are other functions like this [--]!
Let's get back on track.
...... yes
You didn't like it. ...... <cf>I don't have a choice. I'll go put it back in. ......
......I heard that Tirith said ["]Master Erlinse <cf>mustn't</cf> do the repairs["].
Erinse thought that Tirith <cf>cared about her</cf>, but Tirith said that Erinse was <cf>caring about her</cf>.
Tirith must have seen through Erinse's "talent" and <cf>said so</cf>. ......
Listen to this! <cf>I've come up with a better remodeling plan!
<span size="Big">Dismissed! </>
......?　The priests are getting a little tense.
Oh, isn't that Erinse over there? <cf>They look serious. ......
According to the information that just came in, it seems that <cf>we succeeded in driving that thing into a corner!
Well, that's good. ...... <cf>I guess that's a relief for now.
Your advice was correct. <cf>I thank you on behalf of all the priests present here.
No, it is because you all <cf>heard</cf> what I had to say.
<cf>But we must not let our guard down yet. <cf>It is only a matter of time before they are quiet.
Yes, it is. We must make our next move as soon as possible. ......
<cf>What's going on? <cf> Something is very fishy here.
Oh, no. ......
<cf>Please don't worry. <cf>They know what's going on.
If I tell you everything, <cf>Mr. Lugerio will not blame you.
If that's what Mr. Ehrinse says: ......
...... Actually, <cf>Abaritia has escaped from one of the sacred places!
What the heck? <cf>That's a pretty big problem, isn't it?
Yes, it is. So please keep your voice down......
Mugg ......!　I'm sorry. I'm sorry. <cf>The general public has no idea that there are avaritas in the Holy Land.
Thanks to the efforts of the members of the Order, we were able to drive them into the <cf>"trail of digging behind the waterfall".
It was thanks to Erinse's advice. <cf>He told us the movement of the thing as if it were an oracle.
(...... You used the omnistron, didn't you?)
(I was not seen using it, so ......)
Master Lugerio has been working hard to rebuild the Order, and <cf>I was asked to take the lead. ......
I am ashamed to say that I have only been going right and left. <cf>Mr. Ehrinse offered to help me, and that was a big help.
I see. <cf>And what are you going to do with the avaritia you've driven into a corner?
<cf>Mr. Lugerio has instructed us to "If he does any harm, get rid of him.
It will be difficult for the current Order. <cf>Hasn't the affair with the Duchy exhausted you considerably?
......It hits a sore spot, doesn't it? You are absolutely right.
I think the best move we can make now is to <cf>seal off the "traces of the theft behind the waterfall"</cf>......
Um, just a suggestion: ......, <cf>Could we let the congregation pull out for a time?
Eh?　Yes. <cf>It's easy to get them to back off,<cf> but what about after that?
We want them to leave it to us. <cf>We will take care of avaritia.
No, no, no, that's too risky! <cf>Three of us are not strong enough to take on that thing!
Oh, have you not heard of our reputation? <cf>A single Avaritia is no small feat, is it?
But, but ......
<cf>We are a wonder of power. <cf>The more we charge, the more power we have. ......
It's all right. Leave it to me.
...... I'm sure you're right. <cf>You are all approved by the Gods of Buffalia.
Then it must be a blessing from the <cf>God of Buffalia</cf> that you are here now.
I will leave it to you to deal with that thing. <cf>But please do not take it too hard.
<cf>Thank you very much. <cf>I will do my best to bring you good news.
It's just back here. <cf>The place where you drove Avaritia into the ground.
It seems that the entire congregation of the Order has withdrawn. <cf>There should be no problem for Erinse to use her power.
I am sorry. <cf>I'm afraid I've gotten you all into this.
I didn't feel <cf>that I was doing any good just by being in the ...... temple!
So I decided to do what I could, <cf>and ended up ......
I felt like it was just a matter of time before I could do something about it. Besides [--].
I can get paid handsomely by the Order! <cf>Above all, it's an avaritia case. Ho-ho-ho!
Well then, each of you, brace yourselves. <cf>We'll go deep into the forest at once!
We've successfully liberated the avalitaire. ......<cf>Are you all right, my friend?
......Yes, no problem!
Really? <cf>You seem paler than ever......
<cf>Don't worry about it. <cf>I'm just a little tired, that's all.
Now, let's go back to the temple. <cf>The Faithful are waiting for your report.
Mm......
<cf>Don't worry. Aberritya has been defeated. <cf>Please send the congregation around to check on them later.
Oh ......!　Thank you! <cf>Mr. Erinze, you saved the day.
If you want to thank us, you can thank these people. <cf>I was only looking on ......
Now, ...... I would like to thank you all again. <cf>Thank you very much for your help!
I will never forget this debt of gratitude. <cf>May the God of Buffalia bless you all!
Now, I have to submit my report to Mr. Lugerio. <cf>I am sorry, but I must leave now.
<cf>That settles the matter....
How about we have a little launch now? <cf> I'm too hungry to fight
Hm?　What's up, Erinse?
Oh, ...... no, I'm ......, but I'm not very hungry. <cf>I'm not very hungry.
I'm sorry. I'll go rest first. <cf>So ......
Wait, Erinse.
Wait, Erinse.
Ow!
What is it?　What's wrong?
Let go of my hand ....... ......
...... I knew it, you're hurt!
What?　Let me see!
......Oh, you twisted your wrist. <cf>It's already starting to swell!
You did this in the fight just now, didn't you? <cf>Why didn't you tell me right away?
I just missed the ...... time to tell you. <cf>I can handle this level by myself once my body recovers.
In the first place, the release of avaritia is <cf>taxing on your body, isn't it?
Then there is no need to strain yourself in any other way. <cf>Take better care of yourself!
......We want to be of service to you. <cf>A little injury for that purpose [--].
<cf>I can't help Tirith if you get hurt!
I'm sorry about ....... I'll be careful from now on.
...... Do you really understand? <cf> Too much self-sacrifice brings bad luck, doesn't it?
Well, that's all right. First of all, let's treat your injuries. <cf>Let's launch after that.
Yes. ......
That's what I'm talking about, Master! <cf>Thanks for showing up when I was in distress!
<cf>I'm here, too. <cf>What's the matter?
Well, ...... King Norbert has ordered me to sort out what is<cf> left at the Dorava Royal Research Institute.
Most of the research materials have been recovered, but <cf>Master Dunkirk's personal belongings over there are still untouched.
It would be bad for <cf>others to know about the Buffalian Gods or something like that. ......
I see. <cf>In that case, I can think of no one better qualified than you.
I agree. But ......
I'm afraid to go to that place alone.
I still don't <cf>feel</cf> that I have divine blood in me. No, I don't even believe it.
And yet, I wonder if that Dunkirk-sama has enough evidence <cf>over there<cf> to believe so. ......
I know I'm being naive. <cf>But I'm ......
Come with me, Carveen. <cf>Everyone's afraid to be alone.
Come with me, Carveen. <cf>Everyone's afraid of being alone.
Master ......!
Alone is scary,...... isn't it......
Well, if we know what's going on, the master will not blame us if we go with him,<cf> the master,...... or even the king.
Thank you, Master and Master's Lord!
However, I'll make sure you pay the request fee, okay? <cf>Special service fee on top!
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it out of your expense account!　I'll write it off as an expense, don't worry!
You've grown <cf>strong</cf> when it comes to this sort of thing. ......
Well then, I look forward to working with you. <cf>We'll head over as soon as we're ready!
<cf>We'll use this entrance, it's a shortcut to where we want to go.
<cf>But be careful, there seems to be a malfunctioning prototype weapon left in the area.
With us and you, <cf>there's nothing to be afraid of!
Thanks to your masters, we were able to <cf>recover</cf> Dunkirk-sama's personal belongings without incident. Thank you very much.
Mm. Let's see what's in that box right away!
Yes, ....... <cf>Let's go somewhere a little more secluded.
Around here, we'll be a little less conspicuous.
...... Let's open the box!
Yes, I'm sure we can find the box. I have to confront what's in here.
Then [--] I'll open it.
...... photo. Who is this woman?
Lady Dunkirk's wife. Isn't she beautiful? <cf> I heard she passed away when Yoruk was little.
There's a picture of Yoruk when he was a child. <cf>And [--]this is ......
It's the notebook I sent Master Dunkirk for his birthday. <cf>He used it until it was this tattered. ......
<cf>The notebook is the only thing that can be called a record. <cf>...... you want to read it?
...... Apparently, he used it as a diary. <cf>Wow, there's even some notes on the Knights' service.
The king's movements that day are also written in the diary. <cf>As expected of father and son. You have the same meticulous handwriting as Yorke.
Oh, the gifts from Lady Veronica that you received on that day, <cf>were they delicious? Huh, I see. ......
...... The letters are all over the place from here. 'I killed Yoruk,' she said. <cf>The rest is mostly bludgeoning ...... and only partially ......
'Pseudo-avaritia', 'The king is at the mercy of the institute' <cf>'The cult', 'Engram collection', 'The Buffalian Gods'.
The old records", "To the dragon tribe", "Meeting the dragon tribe through XXX's message" <cf>......Who is XXX?
...... This is one day before the assassination of the Duke? <cf>"Dagger," "Decipherment Results," ......
<cf>"Adelaide, the proud warrior of the Buffalian Gods. <cf>"Remember his precious blood, and be a martyr to his mission."
...... Adelaide is ...... mother?
Are you okay with ......?　Can you read ahead?
Oh, oh ....... <cf> 'Carveine is' ...... 'Blood of the Buffalian Gods'
'No', 'Unforgivable', 'Hateful', 'My son' <cf>'Why', 'You're not bad' ......
No.' 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please die."<cf>"When I've done everything, I'll go too."......
......Mom was a normal person. Sure, she was strong, but <cf>a warrior of the Buffalian Gods is not such a ......
Who are you? Who told this lie to the Lord of Dunkirk? <cf>The results of the decipherment must be a fabrication.
Carveen......
That dragon tribe...... Leanbrum, that's him. <cf>They were planning to deceive Master Dunkirk from the beginning.
Who brought the dragon tribe and Master Dunkirk together in the first place? <cf>There is no such thing as a Buffalian God Tribe[--]!
<span size="Big">Carveen! </>
......The Buffalian Gods exist. <span size "Big">Carveen! <cf>They are not so different from men.
<span size="Big">Don't lie to me! </>
...... It's not a lie. It's true, Carveen.
It's not a ...... lie. It's true, Carveen.
Even the master is ....... <cf>So, my mother is ...... the god race is ...... really ......?
Oh ...... something fell out of my pocketbook.
...... this picture.
...... Mr. Dunkirk, Yoruk, and Veronica. <cf>Sorry. I am sorry. I'm sorry......
My blood is ...... without me ......! <cf>Mom, why......!
...... one day, you may reveal the mystery of your mother with your own hands. <cf>Surely that will be a gift!
<span size="Big">U...... ughhhh......! </>
The wards, too, are stable and ......<cf>if there is no more danger, then ...... is good, right?
No, there is always a case. Besides, <cf>Barnhardt parish is in the middle of rebuilding......
...... Oh. Then [--]
I'll ask those guys to escort you. So, what do you think?
Yes?　What, out of the blue?
When did you guys get here?
Because I'm sure those guys are ......
...... If you're the God-approved ones, I don't blame you.
Um, I don't see what you're talking about. ......?
Master Einlein wants to see Master Carveen. <cf> So I was wondering if you could escort him to Barnhart Castle.
<cf>You have a good face for the Duchy, and there are no better people to entrust an oracle priestess to.
Of course, we will pay you for your services. <cf>How about it?
Well, if that's what you want to do, ...... noh?
Thank you ....... My pleasure, please.
Anyway, just take me to Carveen<cf>right?　Easy peasy. Let's go, servant!
Einlein to the masters!　What's going on?
...... because we're ready.
[--]Oh, okay. So. <cf> So let's go.
Yeah. ......
Wait a minute. Don't have a conversation that only you can understand. <cf>Are you going to explain to us that we've escorted you this far?
Because the flower we've been waiting for has bloomed. ......
So I made potpourri.
Potpourri.
...... I thought I'd give it to you.
To Carveen?
To ...... Jörg.
Yoruk's favorite flower bloomed, so I made a potpourri and brought it to him. <cf>Take it with you to the cemetery, that's what I meant.
<span size="Big">You'll finish explaining in one breath! </>
...... I talk a lot, I'm not good at it.
Sorry. Einlein has always been like this.
I'm sure if ...... Jorg was here, <cf>he would have followed it up better than I did.
But visiting Yoruk's grave? <cf> We've never met ......, hmmm.
May I accompany you? <cf>We also have Einlein's escort: ......
May I accompany you? <cf>I also have Einlein's bodyguards ......
Of course!　And I'd like to introduce my master to Yoruk. <cf>All right, Einlein?
Yeah ...... thanks ......
Okay, it's decided. Let's all go visit Yoruk's grave.
Oh, there might be monsters out there, so <cf>make sure the masters are ready!
Isn't the tomb near the castle?
Dunkirk-sama wanted it built a little bit far from the castle,......<cf> where Yoruk used to like to play.
Where the three of us used to play together......
Master, here is Yoruk's grave.
Oh, ......! <cf> There, the bugs are like that!
Ah, I knew there was an outbreak of bugs. ...... <cf>There are a lot of them around here.
Yolk, you don't like bugs. ......
Sorry, Master. <cf>Please help us get rid of the bugs before we visit the grave!
Einlein, potpourri for Yoruk's grave.
This potpourri, it repels insects. When the flowers are in bloom, <cf>Yoruk makes it himself and wears it ......
You made some for me and Einlein, too.
Yeah...... we're okay with bugs, though.
...... you must have been good friends.
...... I was the first one to find this place. <cf>I felt suffocated in the temple, so I ran away......
Yoruk, who came looking for me, <cf>loved the view here,......
After Carveen and I became friends, ......<cf> it became a secret place for the three of us.
When we came here, I was mainly a bug killer, though.
We talked a lot, the three of us, here at ....... <cf>What we liked, our dreams for the future, and our complaints.
But ...... it's just the two of us now. ......
......Hey, Einlein. It's hard to hold on to the memories of the three of us <cf>alone,</cf> but[--].
...... two of us can handle it?
As long as we remember Yoruk, <cf>Yoruk won't be gone. That's what I think.
...... yeah
......It's a relief to have someone to share memories with. <cf>Some wounds are healed by talking to each other.
You know, if you and I <cf>ever get separated,[--]
Will you remember me as ...... we both do?
Oh?　Isn't that Carveen there?
The master and the master's master! <cf>Well, I never thought I'd see you here ......
What, are you doing something you shouldn't be seen doing? <cf>They're the 'heroes' who saved the country from a crisis.
Hero? I don't think I want to hear that word now. ......
......?　What's going on?
......?　What's wrong?
What is it? You don't look very happy.
Why are you in Canaroa in the first place? <cf> I thought you were in the castle.
Well, ...... to be frank, it's a skulk.
<cf> I thought you were in the castle, but frankly speaking, you are skipping out.　You're a strange, earnest man!
...... I became a <cf>made hero</cf> after the Dunkirk incident.
I understand that <cf>I have no choice</cf> but to put things in perspective,......
Being made a "hero" has made it impossible for me to go out in the field <cf>as casually as I used to.
It's all paperwork and ceremonies day in and day out. <cf>That's important, too, but[--].
I just don't feel like it's something I should be doing. <cf>I'm still inexperienced, and I'm not good enough to stand on top of others.
When I thought that, ...... something suddenly made it hard for me to breathe. ......
I realized that I had <cf> forcefully escaped to Canaroa under the guise of an inspection......
Ah,<cf>you haven't adapted to your current environment. <cf>You are more suited to physical labor than to using your head.
I can't let <cf>Einlein see you in such a pathetic state,</cf> and ......
And there is no Yoruk. ......
Master, ...... what am I to do? ......
He is visibly weakening. You look like a wilted nappa. <cf>Now, what should I do......
...... Shall we take the commission together?
...... take a commission with me?
Oh, isn't that good? <cf>Moving around would be a nice change of pace.
[--]Yes, that's right. I've got a place I'd like to go. <cf>Take it as a request from me.
<cf>I'm sure the king will only laugh if you mention our names. You know what?
Well, in that case, by all means! <cf>Please let us join you!
<cf>Then it's decided. <cf>Then let's go on a treasure hunt!
(Oh, it's a treasure hunt after all. ......)
<cf>The target is "Ancient King's Burial Objects"! <cf> The destination is "The Cursed Glimmering Tomb"!
How's that for a change?
Yes, I did!　Thanks to you, it was a lot of fun!
Oh, yeah, yeah. <cf>We had a lot of fun getting our hands on the treasure, too!
Master and his Lord, thank you so much for today. <cf>I'm off back to the castle now.
Oh, wait a minute. Can't you stay with me a little longer? <cf>Preferably to Canaroa's store.
The store ......?
Mm-hmm. The merchant who wants this treasure is a <cf>fan</cf> of yours. I'd like you to sign it for him.
Oh, that's nothing at all!
Oh, I see. Well then, let's get back to Canaroa as soon as possible. <cf>Huffing ...... puffing ...... puffing ......!
(I'm plotting...... definitely plotting something......)
I knew I couldn't buy any higher.
I'm sorry. I'd like to help you, but we're in business too.
[--] Hm?　I think that's Feste, isn't it? <cf> Hello, welcome!
Are you in the middle of a business meeting?　If so, I'll see you later. ......
I hope you don't mind. I'll take this one: ......
Sorry about that. Another time!
No, it's my pleasure. I look forward to working with you again. ...... <cf> haha ......
Um, excuse me, are you in some kind of trouble?
Eh...... Ka, Mr. Carveen!　Is it real!
Yes, I am. If it's all right with me, I'd like to talk to you.
Eh, yeah, yeah......Do, what should I do......!
It is the role of the Knights to help those in need. <cf>Please do not hesitate to talk to us!
Oh, you are a gentleman.
I'm on the receiving end of Master Dunkirk.
Oh, uh, ......, <cf> Actually, we have been unable to provide support to the orphanage. ......
Until now, we've been <cf> distributing meals with the help of the Order, but...
Since the riot, the Order has been having a hard time rebuilding, and <cf>the orphanage has not been able to help them either. ......
I know you want to make money, but <cf>we can't just buy them at a loss.
What about the support of the government?
It's not just the children of the principality, so <cf>official support is ......
The master and his master. I'd like to discuss a few things with you [--].
May I share with <cf>this person what I just got?
What, what?　You[--] Oh, no......<cf>Well, just because it's a matter of ......mmm...... But ......Gunny......
I don't mind.
I'm good.
Oh, God, that's how you get them to give it to you, <cf>so sneaky!
I don't have a choice. I'll give you this much [--].
Please, take <span size="Big">all</span> of this!
What's the matter with you, suddenly handing over the whole thing[--]!
Oh, um, no. <cf>We cannot take advantage of your kindness!
Please don't hesitate to spoil us. <cf> That's how we feed our children!
Mr. Carveen. ......!
You are indeed a hero!　I am in love with your manliness! <cf>I will buy that for a high price in my store!
With the added value of a gift from Master Carveen,......<cf> I'll be able to treat you well with that much!
Master Carveen, I will never forget this favor!
As for me, thank the Master and his Lord. <cf>I would not have been able to do this without the permission of these men.
Yes, sir. Thank you also for your companionship. <cf>Thank you so much for your help!
Ah ...... haha ...... good for you, mmm.
This one's a tough one. ...... <cf>I'll have to report this to the High King and have him take action.
If I, the Hero, advise the Duke, <cf>the civil officials will not be able to ignore what I say.
...... Yes, that's right. I can't <cf>run away from being a hero. I must do what I can as a "hero!
I see. My master and my master's master invited me to the commission to <cf>teach me this. ......
Eh, no, not really. ......
Thanks!　Me, I'm going back to the castle this time. <cf>See you later!
<cf>I'm going back home with a fresh smile, <cf>self-sufficiently satisfied......
Kuu~!　I was actually going to use his title and signature to resell it for <cf>a lot of money!
I knew it: ......
Well, I'm glad I was able to help people! <cf>But darn it all [~~~]!
...... so I can't get in touch with you either. Sorry about that.
No, just keeping this place running is good enough for me.
Jake, I'm hungry!　Give me something to eat.
I think that's called "something please". <cf> Order the damn thing!
I'm not like your dad, I don't like to pay the bill, okay? <cf>...... and I see.
Hey, if it's your dad, <cf>I think these ladies can get in touch with him better than you can.
Is that so?
You met your dad in Kanaloa, right?
Huh?　Oh, yeah. ...... Well, yeah. <cf>But I also happened to meet him in Kanaloa last time I was there.
No, I see. ......
Hey, Jake. How about you, ......?
Sorry for the delay in saying hello. I'm an old friend of your husband's, or should I say <cf> former husband?　I'm an old friend of <cf>'s.
I haven't seen him in a few years. <cf>I was surprised when I heard that the owner of the coin-operated house had been replaced.
I thought something must have happened, so here I am.
His old friend ......?
An old adventurer friend. We used to make a lot of money together until he established the Coin Pavilion.
By the time I became an adventurer, this place was already here. It's been a long time since my dad was still active.
Well, ...... it was about <cf>30 years ago when I started adventuring with him?　We were still young then.
Hey, ......, what was your old husband like?
What was he like in the old days?　He was a cocky son of a bitch!
He used to show up in Asterlys on a whim. <cf>He beat the shit out of me when we were fighting in the street.
He was naive and strangely arrogant. <cf>He had such a beautiful sword<cf>, I thought he must have run away from home with some young lad.
Then he said he wanted to be an adventurer, so I went along with him, thinking it was a test of <cf>guts</cf>. ......
And before I knew it, this coin-operated pavilion had been built.
No, you're skipping around too much. <cf>I'd like to go into more detail ...... and talk about how you can take advantage of their weakness!
Ha-ha-ha!　Well, let's just say that <cf>I</cf> and that guy both ran through our twenties doing stupid things.
But if he shows up out of nowhere, <cf>he's out of nowhere, isn't he? ......
Are you guys regulars here?
We're not so much regulars as we are ...... the owner picked me up, <cf>and I picked him up.
I remember hearing that you picked up a girl a few years ago. ...... Oh, yeah, that's you.
Do you miss him now that he's gone?
Nothing? <cf> I'm a very beautiful girl who is smart enough to be on her own!
You're smart. ...... Well, <cf>your father gave me the stamp of approval on the money mess.
Ha-ha-ha!　That's good! <cf>It's an important thing to live for!
<cf>Mmm, your reaction is somewhat similar to my husband's. <cf> I guess we're just like each other. They're all inedible.
Do you have any more inedible friends than me? <cf>Yes. ......
<cf>If you are interested in his old stories, <cf>you should visit a woman named Ruth in Larpal.
I think she knows more about his weaknesses than I do.
Well, I'm off then. <cf>When you see her husband, tell him I was worried.
Mm-hmm. If I see him.
A woman named Ruth in Lalpar or ....... <cf>I'd like to go talk to her.
Um, is there a person named Ruth here?
<cf>Oh, my dear, lovely guest. <cf>Luce is me, what's up?
<cf>I'm the one who helped you at the Coin Pavilion in Asterlys. <cf>I wanted to ask you about your husband's story: ......
......!　You must be Feste-chan! <cf>I've seen you a few times at the coin-operated pavilion.
Oh, really?　Oh, really?
Yes, I've seen you at Coin-tei a few times. When I went to his place for a drink or something. <cf>So you can use your normal tone of voice, okay?　Hmmm...
Nuh...... I see, he's an inedible friend......
So?　You're telling me he's disappeared? <cf> Just so you know, I don't know where he's going.
Oh, that's okay. <cf> I just wanted to hear his old stories.
<cf> I was wondering if you had any embarrassing stories you could tell me that would make me vulnerable.
Hmmm...what's that? <cf>I know I know a lot of them.
We had adventures together, and we were <cf>'friendly' in our own way at one time,...... right?
I'd be happy to <cf>talk to him about Feste-chan, the girl he loves so much. It would be a way to get back at him for suddenly disappearing.
By all means!　Don't worry, I'll forgive you.
Well, I guess you could <cf>survive the Asteria Plains in just your underwear after <cf>Landfox ripped your pants off?
Or maybe you slipped and ran <cf> into a pile of Uribo's feces. ......
That husband of yours?　I wish I could have seen it right in front of my eyes!
Hmmm... I feel sorry for her if I keep telling her embarrassing stories, so I'll have to share some good ones with you.
He's quite family oriented. <cf>He really cared about his brother back home.
He said he was better made than he was, and more serious. ...... <cf>Oh, by the way [--].
I remember he once begged me to give a rare book I had to <cf>["]give to my brother["]<cf>[--]"].
It was an old adventure book. <cf>["My brother likes this kind of thing, so..."].
My brother ......
That guy was friendly and had a lot of friends, but he didn't <cf>talk about himself much</cf>, so I remember your brother's story well.
Oh yeah, he was busy at the time, so <cf>I arranged to give it to him instead.
Do you remember the ...... address?
I think it was addressed to someone named Helge at ...... Canaroa. <cf> If you care about that guy, why don't you ask him?
You're not going?
...... I'm a little too old <cf> to go into their affairs.
I'll leave the rest to you. I'll leave the rest to you.
If you see him, <cf>tell him he's an idiot.
Ha-ha. Okay.
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Helge, by any chance?
...... Oh, you've made it this far!
Welcome, both of you. <cf>The king has told us all about you.
You know who we are?
Yes, of course.
<cf> The map to sneak into Barnhart Castle, <cf> that was arranged by me at the Duke's request.
What a ......!
He has asked me to tell you the truth <cf>when you get here.
[Would you <cf> like to hear about the dead and living kings?
...... Mm.
Well, I would like to tell you an old tale, if only for a little longer.
[--]But first, <cf>please fetch me the Duke's Herb.
What?
I've been told by the <cf>King that nothing is more expensive than a free story. It's a fee for information, sir.
Gnun ......!　You bastard. ......
Come, my servant!　It pains me to do what he wants, but <cf>I can't come all the way here and leave empty-handed!
Well, good luck with that. Ho-ho-ho!
How's it going?　I've got what you asked for!
Well done. As expected of the people whom the Lord King has favored. <cf>And now, as I promised, let's go to the tale of the old days.
Make it quick, please.
Well, that depends on the mood of this old man. <cf> Ho-ho-ho!
Who are you, to begin with?
<cf> I was originally the Lord King's education officer. <cf>When he left the castle, I had no more use for him.
He left the castle......
...... that man was a twin!
<cf>Younger twin brother was imprisoned and brought up to be useful as a shadow of his elder brother.
<cf>He was grieved by this. <cf>His brother was better than him,</cf> he said,</cf> ......
<cf>Your brother did not want to be king. <cf>So [--].
<cf>He left the castle just before his accession to the throne. <cf>To give the throne to his younger brother who was in a shady position. ......
After that, you guys know better than I do, don't you?
While an adventurer in <cf>Asterlys,<cf> he set up a coin pavilion: ......
He was a single man, <cf>because he didn't want to leave his blood behind</cf>, but he helped his younger brother from time to time.
Thanks to his efforts, the younger brother's reign was relatively <cf>peaceful</cf>. ......
But then, secretly but steadily, the <cf>Drava Royal Institute</cf> took his wife and children hostage.
Your brother tried to do something about it, but in the end he became a puppet for the institute.
<cf> he ended up losing his life at the hands of Dunkirk, who was bent on avenging his son's death. ......
So, the husband is back in the fold. <cf> I understand the story, but ......
...... but you don't agree with it, do you?
If you wish to speak directly with the king, <cf>I will be your intermediary.
Please. I want to talk to him.
I understand. <cf> Then go to Barnhardt Castle.
I am sure he would like to speak with you.
You have come. Helge has told me all about you.
I see that Jake has taken over the coin pavilion. <cf>I'm relieved. I'm sure he'll do fine.
...... your old friend is here at the Coin Pavilion. <cf>He was worried about you.
It was <cf>Ruth from Larpal who told me about Helge. She told me to tell him that he was a fool.
You are still a harsh woman.
...... you are okay with this?
Hm?
You want to abandon the store you built in Asterlys and <cf>now</cf> live as a public king?
Do you wish to abandon the shop you built in Asterlys, <cf>not tell the truth to the store's patrons or to your friends, <cf>and just throw it all away?
Will you pretend that <cf>everything</cf> that you have obtained through your power never happened!
Don't bear that question.
...... I had no business being a king. <cf>I wanted to be an adventurer and live on my own.
It was not only me, but also my imprisoned brother ....... <cf>He had the same dream.
But I was good enough to have another me, <cf>I pushed it all away and ran away.
30 years. <cf>For 30 years, my brother went along with my selfishness.
If that's the case, I guess it's my turn to <cf>take care of him</cf>.
Fortunately, his wife and children are safe. <cf>I can carry his blood to the next generation.
Once we settle the mess in the country, <cf>I'll hand the throne over to my nephew and that'll be the end of it.
We'll just have to put up with him for a few years or so after that.
...... And then what?　Back to Asterlys?
...... Wouldn't it look bad to be on the run again?
The people will be surprised if they find out that the high king has been replaced. <cf>This is a secret, okay?
...... is fine. I'll keep it quiet.
But in exchange, I'd like to get some hush money.
That's what I'm talking about. So how much do you want?
The hush money is for the information about Barnhart.
Sometimes I like to do this ......<cf> and have you tell me the information directly.
Feste......
......<cf>That's a very high hush money, to have the King tell you that information.
All right, I'll take care of it. I'll settle for that. Is that clear?
Yes, of course!
<cf> That's all I need to know. <cf>We're done here. Let's get out of here, my servant!
Oops. You, lend me your ears for a moment.
Take care of ...... Feste. <cf> That guy is lonelier than most.
...... I'm glad you're here. Thanks.
Holy cow, servant!　Don't leave the Lord alone. Come quickly!
Farewell, my golden days. ......
So ...... thanks for letting me know. <cf> You guys take care.
Yeah, I'll let you know if I hear anything else. I'll let you know if I hear anything else. Bye!
Charlotte......? <cf>What are you doing here?
Oh, it's Feste and the others. You know[--].
Not you-know-what. Don't wander around so much. <cf>Do you know what you're getting yourself into?
You still haven't settled the matter of that armed group. <cf>You never know when you might be targeted.
U...... sorry. <cf>But this time, there was something that really bothered me.
<cf>I came here because I heard a rumor that might have something to do with that militia group.
What ......?
I overheard it at the coin pavilion. <cf>There are some thieves who have been targeting traveling entertainers recently.
<cf>But they don't steal anything, even though they are called thieves. <cf>It seems that they are targeting the traveling entertainers themselves.
I came over here <cf>to talk to other people too,<cf> but ......
I didn't realize that you are that brigand: ......
With the way they're dressed from what I've heard about them, <cf>I think they're probably the ones who were after me.
Wait, wait, wait. It's too early to draw any conclusions.
Anyway, ...... it is, isn't it? <cf>My servant, I and you will gather some more information.
I think I saw some traveling entertainers in town. <cf>Let's go talk to them!
<cf> Charlotte, you go back to the pavilion. <cf>It's not safe for you to be alone.
No, I'll stay here and talk to them some more.
Don't worry!　I'm already good friends with the clerk here. <cf> To the point that they'll let me know if they see anyone suspicious.
Huh?　When did you ......
A traveling entertainer must have a knack for getting into the other person's pocket, right?
Goodness, what a horrible girl you are. ......
Well then, I'll leave you to gather information on the outside. <cf> Let's report back to each other here later.
<cf>Sorry~! <cf>May I have a word with you, brother?
Oh?　What is it? <cf> I'll talk to a pretty girl about anything.
Oh, no, I don't think you're cute! <cf>You know what I mean!
I have a question for you! <cf>Have you been attacked by a bandit lately?
A bandit?　Oh, that. It's a rumor among my friends. <cf>They only target us traveling entertainers, right?
Thanks to them, we can't even get around. <cf>We have to hire guards for safety.
By the way, where are you going to be?
Well, ...... I first heard a rumor that it was near <cf>Salamuzat</cf>.
Salamzert......I see what you mean......
...... You don't think I'm going to try to beat you? <cf> I don't think you should.
Apparently, they're not proper guys, you know? <cf>Everything [--]
["]If you don't kill them, they'll kill you["]<cf>and it seems like they're going to attack you.
That's ...... a little scary.
Yup. It's not normal, right? <cf>That's why I said you shouldn't stick your neck out.
Cute girls especially. <cf>Then come and watch me dance if you feel like it!
Hm?　Do you want something from me?
Yes, I do. <cf>I heard that there are thieves who attack only traveling entertainers, and I was wondering if you had any information about them.
Are you going to exterminate them, by any chance? <cf>We would be very grateful if that were the case.
That depends on the situation. ......
Hmmm?　Well, whatever. <cf>The other day, my friend was attacked by those thieves.
What?　What about your friend?
He died. ...... <cf>People die so easily, don't they?
That's ...... my condolences. ......
She was still a young and pretty girl. <cf>I saw her body and it was a blow to the neck. It's terrible, isn't it?
It's like they just want to take your life. ......<cf> They're not thieves anymore.
Where was your friend attacked?
According to a fellow traveler, he was on his way to Minsterhorn from Larpall.
That's all I know. <cf>Why don't you ask others~?
I will do so. Thank you very much!
<cf>Thank you so much! <cf>Avenge your friend, if you can!
What's up, you guys. <cf> If you want to see my tricks, you'll have to pay me!
Well, don't say so. <cf>I was just wondering if you knew anything about the recent rumors of thieves attacking traveling entertainers...
Ugh, stop it! <cf> I don't even want to remember those guys!
Huh?　Uncle, you don't mean to say that you met with the bandits!
Oh, it was last night. <cf>I think it was about the border between the Minster Hills and the Andorra Basin.
I felt their eyes staring at me, <cf>so I turned around and saw them standing there in the ...... darkness.
<cf>I turned around and saw him standing there in the dark, his eyes bloodshot red. <cf>Mumbling the whole time.
I looked at his clothes and realized that the guy I was with was the rumored bandit. <cf>We both escaped with our lives.
...... didn't they attack you?
Come to think of it,...... there was no sign of movement. <cf>I'm pretty sure he looked at me and mumbled something about ["]man["]["]no["]. ......
Oh, I got chills just thinking about it. <cf>That's all for now. Well, I'm back!
Thanks for your hard work!　Did you get anything out of it?
Well, there you have it. <cf>Let me summarize the information we've got [--].
<cf> Wild thieves do not attack male traveling entertainers. <cf> Female traveling entertainers don't steal things, they take lives.
Their mental state is not normal. <cf>[<cf>[If you don't kill them, they will kill you ["]"], it is said.
Sightings are near Salamzert, <cf>between Larpal and Minsterhorn: ......
More recently, last night, he said it was around the border of the Minster Hills and <cf>Andorra Basin.
...... I knew it was the same group that came after <cf>me</cf> in Salamzat.
And they are getting closer and closer to here.
If they don't find me, <cf>the other traveling performers and everyone else in the troupe will too ......!
That's no good!　I have to do something!
Oh dear. I like your spirit, but I think you need to keep your cool.
Even if you do something about it, what are you going to do? <cf>Take on an armed group by yourself?
U......
We'll lend you our strength.
We'll help you.
...... you sure?
Well, it's a boat we're in. Besides [--]
I have a bad feeling about that armed group. <cf> My horns are tingling.
Well, if you're willing to lend a hand, <cf>can I tell you what I think?
From what I've been told, there aren't that many of them. Maybe three or four at the most ......
If that's how many, I think we can track them down to some ruins and <cf>you and I can chase them down.
No, it's your legs you're confident in, isn't it? <cf>They're the ones with the arms[--].
I've never had the chance to show them off, but <cf>I can actually handle a bow.
I got a lot of <cf>training while I was on the run with Carveen!
<cf>Attack is the best defense, right? <cf>So I thought it might be a good idea to try to set them up.
Hmmm......... If the number of opponents is small, that's a good idea. <cf>Then we just need to figure out where to lure them to......
Well, if the most recent sightings are in the Minster Hills and near the Andorra Basin,......
How about <cf>The Ruins of the Giant Tower?
If we walk around there conspicuously, <cf>we'll catch them eventually.
It's a sketchy plan, but <cf>if we're in a hurry to solve this, there's no other way: ......
Fine. I'll go with your idea. <cf>But don't be reckless, okay?
<cf> Yes, I understand!　I'll show you how good I am with the bow.
Now that we've got the wildling sightings out of the way, <cf>how do we find them?
That won't be necessary. <cf> They're already close by: ......
...... traveling entertainers...... women...... baboons, baboons......
Wild thieves or ......! <cf>You noticed that ......
On the way here. <cf>I was guiding you, pretending not to notice.
...... looking this way. <cf>Are there ......3 people looking at you?　Four?　I guess.
Charlotte. <cf>Let's see how good your bow is!
I know you're looking at me [--] I know you're looking at me!
Whoooaaa!
I got hit!
I knew it was them from that time!
The woman ...... traveler ...... kills ....... <cf>Charlotte...... Korosu...... Korosu......!
Servant! Drive them to the "Ruins of the Giant Tower"! <cf>Charlotte, keep shooting arrows!
Roger that!
[--]Ahh!
Gu......guuuu......!
They've escaped!　Good, keep up the chase!
Ugh...... they're heavy. Shall we dump them here?
No!　We're not letting them go <cf>until we know exactly what these people are up to!
And we need to get them to tell us where the rest of their friends are.
So I'll continue to take you to <cf>Asterlys</cf> at any cost. ......
Kuu, unexpected hard work ......!
Hmm?　Oh no, are you awake? <cf>Even though I've tied you up, you'll be in trouble if you get out of control.
<cf>Servant. I'll give him a little shot and knock him out.
Uu......<span size="Big">Uaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! </>
Hey, what!　What is it!
Korosu charlotte korosu sharuroto korosu<cf> sharuroto korosu korosu or else korosarerererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere!
Oh ......aaa......<span size="Big">I hate it! </>
Oh, hey, you fell down bubbling!
....... <cf>............ he's dead!
No lie......!
It's true what the ...... servants say. <cf>They're ...... dead......!
Oh no......!　It's our fault!
Calm down. We dragged you all this way to make sure you were alive.
Is this more of a ...... seizure? <cf>Are we all going to ...... at once because we've outlived our usefulness?
What the hell is that? You're not a puppet!
...... a puppet? Maybe I'm right.
These guys were acting weird. <cf>They didn't seem to be in a proper state of mind.
Maybe they were all under some kind of suggestion and <cf>it was released......?
And even then, it was such a sudden ......
...... lizard's tail cut off. <cf>Is there a separate main body ......?
Charlotte. I still think you should stay in Asterlys and <cf>stay out as much as possible.
If you are attacked while we are gone, run to the temple. <cf>Einlein will help you.
<cf>They have guards there, and they won't be so easy to deal with.
Uh-huh......
Ha,...... this has been a bad one!
...... sorry I got you into this.
It's okay. <cf>Now let's go back to Asterlys.
(What's that ...... something ......)
(I feel like something tremendous, <cf> big is happening ......)
Oh, Einlein. Are you taking a break?
If you're ...... warding, you're doing fine.
Okay. That's good to hear. <cf> Don't take it too hard yourself.
<cf>Yes, I've got this. <cf>Oh, yes, this.
I just received this from Carveen. <cf>A letter addressed to Charlotte: ...... Can you give it to her?
...... Carveen, she seems <cf>very concerned about the armed group.
He wrote in his letter to ...... me that he wanted me to <cf>keep her safe<cf> while she was in Asterlys.
Come to think of it, he hasn't been able to see Charlotte much since the whole affair between the Duchy and the Order.
I understand. I'll give him the letter. <cf>Charlotte will be pleased.
...... If she writes back, deliver it to me. <cf>I'll give it to her. ......
It's safer that way,...... and I'll get there quicker,......
Roger that. I'll let her know.
There she is. Charlotte!　A letter for you. <It's from Carveen.
From Carveen!　Let me see!
......Good, he's fine for now!
What does it say?
......["]I'm your escort and I'm sorry I've been away. <cf>I'll be sure to come see you when I get settled in."]......
Carveen sounds a bit like a <cf>prince in a play, doesn't he? Hmmm...
He's not really a prince. <cf>I think he's more of a guard dog.
Well, it's good to be witty.
In your letter to Einlein, you also wrote that you <cf>wanted</cf> him to take care of you.
The letter to Einlein: ......?
Oh, Einlein gave me that letter.
Yes. He also said that if you write back, Einlein will put it together and give it to <cf>Carveen</cf>.
Einlein put them together and gave them to ......?
Does ...... Einlein meet with Carvain?
I wouldn't say often, but there are <cf>discussions between the Duchy and the Order. Maybe. I don't know.
Yes ......, I know. We used to be friends, and now we're heroes and <cf> oracle priestesses. We see each other a lot.
It's only natural, yes. ......
What's wrong with you?
...... Nothing. But I'll <cf>go give Einlein the answer to your letter myself.
No, no, no, you shouldn't go out so much. <cf>We'll [--].
<span size="Big">I'll go myself</span>.
What is this indescribable pressure ......?
Well, I'll have to write back soon. <cf>Thanks for delivering. Well, then...
Hmmm............yeah, you said that, but I'm worried about it. <cf>We'll go to the temple later, just in case.
I wrote a letter to Carveen. <cf>Can you deliver it?
<cf>Thank you. <cf>Thank you.
(She's a priestess of the oracle, but she's friends with him ......)
(She's a ...... beautiful girl with a face. (Her face is  a beautiful girl. She also has a mysterious atmosphere.)
(Her voice is also ...... fragile and cute.)
(Carveen would <cf> know her personality better than ...... I do.)
(Overall, I feel like ...... protecting her?)
(And ...... style, too ......)
Charlotte, what's up ......?
......Ahhhhh, you can't win!
(But, but, I'm not losing either! <cf> I think I'm on the right track!　I'm a reputed diva!)
（<cf>I'm a reputed diva! <cf>If you give up, it's over!　(Yeah, I'll be fine!)
I won't lose!
What ...... yes ......? <cf> Well, God bless the Buffalians! ......
That's where I pray!　It's a sign that you can afford it!
What ...... is not a scene for blessing, no?
No!　Thanks for the blessing from the oracle priestess though!
How about ...... you're welcome ......?
Oh my gosh, that kind of pomposity is good, <cf> I'm sure!　I want one too!
？？？？？
What are they doing?
I don't know, but it smells like youth ......
Oh MURIE, any easy and reasonable requests?
As usual, Feste. <cf>There are no such requests.
I'd like to say there aren't, but <cf> there are, and here they are: ......
What?　Tell me quickly! <cf>We'll take it before someone else does!
Calm down. This request just came in, but <cf>we haven't advertised it yet. Because ......
The request and the reward are so out of proportion, <cf>that it's a bit suspicious.
Huh?　What is it?
<cf>"I need you to buy me a few days' worth of daily necessities. <cf> And this is what I get paid for it.
What about ......?　What's the big payoff?
<cf>If it's true, it's a mistake. <cf>If it were true, even I would be suspicious.
I thought so too, so I checked with my client, but <cf>he says it's not a mistake!
Is it a bad deal ...... in the name of daily necessities?
I'm not sure if that's a possibility.
......, so <cf> I'll ask Feste and the others to take care of this.
There is nothing suspicious about the client or the contents. <cf> Just not worth the reward.
You did it, Feste-chan! <cf>That's exactly what we've been looking for, an "easy, good-paying job"!
Huh!　<cf>You've been trying to force us into this from the very beginning!
<cf>Until now, Jake has been taking care of this kind of shady business for us, as well as doing the research.
You guys are Jake's favorite disciples, <cf>I can trust you with them!
Who's the love pupil?　Who!
...... Well, I've been indebted to the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>Well, I've been taking care of the Pioneer Bureau for a while now, and I'd like to return the favor, wouldn't you?
Thank you! <cf>If you want to talk to a client, go to the temple.
Oh?　Mr. Feste and the others......<cf> What's the matter?
<cf>I'm here today on business from the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I heard there was a client here.
Pioneer Bureau......What? <cf>Maybe you are the one who took care of that request......
<cf>We accepted the request from the Pioneer Bureau.　<cf>We accepted the request to <cf>"buy some daily necessities. ......
Yes, that's me. That's me.
<span size="Big">It's you! </>
Wow, that all made sense at once. <cf>You wouldn't know the price of the request.
Um, ...... no good? <cf> Did I do something wrong?
No, never mind. <cf>I'm glad to know it's not a shady request.
By the way, what are commodities? <cf> Is there something wrong with the care of the temple?
No, the people at the temple are very good to me.
This time, I'm completely complacent, or perhaps <cf> my inadequacies have come out in full force. ......
Hmm?　I'll tell you what's going on.
...... I stayed here because I'm worried about Tirith, <cf> but [--].
I felt sorry for the burden that I had to put on you guys. ......
So, when I was thinking about what I could do to help, <cf>I made the acquaintance of a grandmother who came to the temple.
She told me that she was having a hard time going to the market because of her old age and weak legs.
I thought I could <cf>help her with the daily necessities, so I offered to do so. ......
I thought that I could help him with the daily necessities, but shopping at several places and spending money was very difficult for me, so I ......
I was in a bit of a bind, so I sent in a request to the Pioneer Bureau.
Yes, I did. I had no idea that <cf>you</cf> would take care of it. ......
No, I'm glad it was us. <cf>I'll have to thank Murie later.
Well, now that it turned out to be a non-event, <cf>we'll get it over with.
<cf>Are you sure you have the list of commodities you need, <cf>this list that you got from the settlement office?
Yes. Nemalina soap, fluffy flour, and <cf> suffragette seeds.
Okay, I've got "Nemalina's Soap" and "Fluffy Flour". I'll buy "Nemalina's Soap" and "Fluffy Flour" from the peddler.
For "Safrea Seeds," please go to ......<cf>It would be quicker to go and collect them.
Well then, we'll go and get some.
I'll go with you.
Since you are the client this time,<cf> you should wait here. That's the way it should be.
U...... understand. <cf>Thank you very much.
Welcome!　What can I get for you today?
I would like to have some Nemalina soap.
We have "Nemalina's Soap"! <cf>That's popular, isn't it?　Here you go!
Mm-hmm. Sure thing!
Hello~. What can I do for you today?
I was wondering if you have any fluffy flour.
We have some good fluffy flour.
Oh, I'm sure that will satisfy your grandmother.
I collected the safflower seeds.
This is "Safrea Seeds", isn't it? <cf>As I thought, collecting them was faster.
Hohoho. <cf> I was right!
Thank you for waiting, my client. <cf>I've gathered up the daily necessities!
<cf>Thank you very much! <cf>You are a skilled adventurer, aren't you?
<cf>Yes, I've got the list right. <cf>So, let's go to Granny's!
Excuse me, granny. <cf>Are these the items you need?
Oh, thank you!　That was really helpful. <cf>It's hard to shop at my age. ......
<cf>I'll be happy to help again if you need it. <cf>I would like to say ......
<cf>These are the people who helped us with what we needed this time.
Oh, no, we are ......
<cf>We are <cf>...... for our inability to help. <cf>I am so embarrassed!
Oh, I see. Thank you, ladies.
And hey, Erinse. <cf>There is no shame in relying on others to do what you can't do!
You see, this is why I also turned to Erinze. <cf>It's all about helping each other in this world. See?
When you go to the temple, please listen to me again. <cf>See you then.
...... This completes the request. Thank you very much. <cf>I apologize for the trouble I have caused you.
I don't mind the hassle. But...]
<cf>First of all, you should have a proper sense of money. <cf>I'll say it now, but what was that high fee?
What?　I thought that was the going rate. ......
It's too high!　It's okay that we accepted the request, but if we had submitted a request like that, the market price would have collapsed!
To begin with, responding to requests from residents requires a wealth of knowledge and <cf>the ability to apply it to any situation!
<cf>There are limits to what you, a princess brought up in this era, can do on your own.
Ugh...... you are right. ...... <cf>I may have been a little hasty.
Feste is right, I will try to get used to the world. <cf>First of all, I need to improve my financial sense!
In that case, what should I do? <cf>Try shopping a lot or ......?
I can only see a future of wasting money. ...... <cf>You're right: ......
<cf>How about doing some customer service work to get a feel for how people act and think in this day and age?
<cf>And if you are physically active, you will be less likely to feel anxious that <cf>you are the only one who is not doing anything.
...... Yes, that's right. <cf>I'm sure Jake's place will be fine! <cf>I suggest you help out at the Coin Pavilion if you do!
That's a great idea! <cf>I'll ask Jake for help as soon as I can!
After a while [--]
Welcome!
Erinze!　What's with you, you're dressed like that!
This is my work clothes. <cf> If you're going to work, you have to change, says Jake.
Servant. Go get Mewry. Tell her that Jake is happy to let <cf>an innocent woman dress as a maid.
STOP, it's a misunderstanding ze? <cf> That was Ms. Erinze's own choice!
That's not true, although I did put it on the list of candidates: ......
Hou. What else did you have in mind?
Hmm?　This one or that one: ......?
Mewly! <cf> Here's a pervert!
You're just a little short in the skirt, oooh!
Hmmm... I like it, though.
There, there!　What a strong-looking guy there! <cf>Will you listen to me for a minute?
<cf>Would you listen to me for a minute?　<cf>Master is the one who looks strong around here, is that right?
Yes, yes, that's right. And by the way, you too, brother. <cf>You are adventurers, right?　Please let me make a request.
What's with the suddenness? I'll tell you, we're expensive. <cf> We'll take your request so easily.
<cf>Are you in trouble? <cf> If we can help you, we will.
Carveen!　<cf>Why do you take such a cheap deal?
I'm sorry. It's not in my <cf>pride</cf> to leave someone in need.
<cf> ...... You're a sweetheart, aren't you? <cf>Well, that's all right. I'm not going to start rambling on here.
Let's talk about your request. <cf>Be prepared to pay a surcharge in some cases.
Please don't give me a surcharge. ...... <cf>We're in real trouble.
A while ago, a monster started showing up, <cf>and he's been wrecking the village.
They come in the morning, at night, sometimes even during the day. <cf>We all can't even get to work anymore. ......
That's tough. You must have no time to relax.
Master!　May I <cf>help these people?
Oh. I can't pass up on someone in need.
Yup. Can't overlook people in need.
Thank you very much!　You're a master!
So, what do we do at ......?　What should we do? <cf> Intercept the monsters as they come at us?
No, I want them to make the first move if possible. <cf>We can't stand to have our village razed to the ground anymore......
We know where he lives. <cf>It's just west of here.
Please save us. Please! <cf>If we don't, the village will die!
<cf>Yes, let me and my master take care of it! <cf>We will save the village!
Oh, dear. You good-for-nothing master and disciple. <cf>Well, if it's a request that comes with a reward, so be it.
The monster's home is west of here, right? <cf>Let's take a quick peek.
According to our information, this area seems to be the home of the <cf>monsters</cf> that come to attack the village. ......
...... they don't seem to be around right now.
MUU...... let's take a look around a little bit.
[I've been waiting and waiting, but they haven't shown up at all! <cf>Are you sure this is the right place?
Maybe we're in the wrong place. <cf>Let's go back to the village!
Oh, you guys! <cf> I guess we must have gotten separated.
<cf>Monsters attacked us a while ago. <cf>We should have had them intercept us here: ......
Oh my!　And the damage to the village!
It's [--]
Don't worry. There is no damage at all.
After all, our proud Order of the Knights of Barnhart has <cf>intercepted</cf>!
You, Barnhart's ......
Sir Hugo!
No, I just happened to come upon the scene of the attack. <cf>We couldn't just overlook it. ......
However, we could not stop him. <cf>That thing is smart. He knows when to pull back.
It's a nasty monster that's been targeting us.
Even the knights of the duchy can't get away with it,<cf>what are we supposed to do? ......
...... Carveen, you and your team are <cf>requested</cf> by this man to take him down?
Yes, sir. As one of the knights of the duchy, I can't just leave someone in trouble.
<cf> You are very humble to call yourself one of the knights. <cf>You are a "hero," so you should be more dignified.
I'm ......
Now, for those of you who know Carveen. <cf>How about it?　How about a co-op here?
A joint fight?
Yes. It takes a lot of manpower to defeat that monster. <cf>And you have to be good at it.
But unfortunately, I have only three knights with me to escort me on my inspection tour.
So, I would like to ask for your help, <cf>including Carveen's</cf> help!
Ah!　Of course, if we are successful, <cf>we will give you all the reward!
I am still a public figure, after all. <cf>I can't line my own pockets on an inspection tour.
So it is purely a matter of helping people. <cf>What do you think?
......We haven't even seen the monster yet. <cf>But the Knights have already fought him off.
Then, as he says, it would be more efficient if we <cf>team up</cf>.
We have a deal. Then, let's say that we are friends now.
Would you <cf>take me to the place where the monsters live</cf>? I would like to check a few things.
I'll leave the protection of the village to the Knights, so <cf>I'll ask you guys to protect me.
You are Master Hugo's escort or ....... <cf>I must be careful not to look at the lady on the way.
I don't like that, Carvain! <cf>I'm always all about work, right?　Hahaha!
We're here. This area is where the monsters live. <cf>...... Apparently, they're not back yet!
That's convenient. <cf>Let me check it out a little.
...... Hey, if <cf>he's headed back to the village again?
I'm sure he did. <cf>And I made sure he did before he left the village.
Well, what about ......? <cf>They made him do that: ......!
Yes, I did. But it's ok. <cf>What do you think I left the Knights in the village for?
See, while they are attracting the monsters, <cf>we'll be searching for a place to live!
You, from the very beginning, were planning to use your friends as bait!
Don't be so angry. <cf>I just had something on my mind.
...... That monster is not attacking the village for food. <cf>There must be another reason for attacking a village somewhere!
Well, I have an idea what it is. <cf>I just need one more dot to connect the dots.
Oh, the knights of the principality are sturdy. <cf> Don't worry, they won't die in a little while.
Oh, you!
I'm sorry. Hold it back for now.
All knights are used to this kind of thing. <cf>It's our job to put our bodies on the line.
<cf>Master Hugo is right, let's explore this area.
Master Hugo is a man of one or two quirks, but <cf>he is not a high civil official.
I am sure he will find a way to solve the problem.
......I can't help it if you, a member of the Order, say so. <cf>I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'll check around here.
......!　Take a look at this!
......!　Look at this!
...... human footprints and the remains of a ravaged area. <cf>Yes, of course!
<cf>This is definitely what caused the monsters to attack the village!
What do you mean? <cf>I don't really know. ......
Someone in the village took the monster children. <cf> That species, the children are more expensive to sell as material.
Material....... <cf>Committed by someone who got greedy. ......
It is enough to know this. Let's hurry back to the village. <cf>We must check the current status of the child.
Dear Hugo!　I am so glad to hear that you are safe!
I knew we were attacked by monsters. <cf>Are you struggling?
I am ashamed to say. As Hugo told me, <cf>I succeeded in guiding them, but [--].
<cf>When it comes to capturing them, it's a painstaking process. <cf>Anyway, we are short of manpower.
It's all right, it's all right. <cf>Carveen and the others will lend a hand.
[--] That's why I'm counting on you. <cf>Ah, please capture the monsters without killing them.
You can say whatever you like. <cf>No choice. Let's go, servants and carve-ins!
All right, it looks like we managed to capture it.
Let's go back to the village and report back.
I never thought I'd actually catch that monster. ...... <cf>Thank you!　Thank you very much!
Now I can finally sleep in peace: ......
Oops, you haven't solved the problem yet. <cf>I have to ask you something.
...... I know there are people in this village who took that monster's <cf>child for money!
......ッ!
Anyway, I don't care if the child is alive or dead, so <cf>would you please come forward?
[--]If you remain silent, <cf>I will release the monster right here and now.
No, don't do that! <cf>It was me!　It was me!
You ......!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. <cf>I found the nest and I just had the urge to ......
What happened to the ...... child?
They are still alive. I can sell them for more money that way. ......
You've got to be kidding me! <cf>You got us all in a lot of trouble!
Ho, I'm really sorry! <cf>I was too scared to say it out loud. ......
You son of a bitch!
Yes, that's enough. <cf>Don't make things worse without meaning to!
But it's this guy's fault, all of us!
Fortunately, no one died, right? <cf>Then there is still room for discussion.
First of all [--] what is the problem in the first place?
Huh?　It's because this guy <cf> kidnapped a monster child: ......
Why did you have to do it?
...... Grandma's not well. I wanted to get her treated in <cf>the Duchy or Asterlys......
So I wanted some money as soon as possible. <cf>I had to borrow money from people in the village, but there was a limit to how much I could borrow. ......
You got your answer. <cf>So it was poverty!
If he didn't have to worry about money, he wouldn't have gone on such an outburst of <cf>stealing monster children!
Yes ...... but ......
With all due respect, this village is not rich as a whole.
Then why don't we first <cf>think about how we can all enjoy the wealth?
Well, such a difficult thing for us ......
If it's okay with me, I'll consult with you. <cf>But I have a certain amount of face in the principality, so...
....... <cf>In the meantime, meet my dad ......, the village chief.
You bring your monster children. <cf>And we'll take care of the money. ......
......!　Sorry. Thanks ......!
That's okay too. I told you<cf> that I have a good face in the Principality.
It's nothing more than arranging for a doctor. <cf> Don't worry.
Well, <cf>thank you very much for your assistance this time!
We will take care of the rest, so don't worry about it. <cf>Oh, I should give you your reward as well.
Now then, I will go to the village headman's house to see him. <cf>Good day to you all!
...... As you said, <cf>you have not served as a high civil official, have you?
He took advantage of the commotion to win the hearts of the villagers.
As I recall, he said he was on an inspection tour for an emigration plan. <cf>...... this could be one of the candidate sites.
Geez, winking at ....... <cf>He knows we're on to something, doesn't he?
We never miss an opportunity we find. ...... <cf>Truly, a man without a clue.
<cf>You two are just in the right place. <cf>I have a small favor to ask you, if you don't mind.
<cf> Yes?　Depends on what it is.
Thank you very much. <cf>Because of your closeness to the Lady Einlein, I would like to ask you to help me with this matter.
In fact, someone claiming to be a "oracle priestess" has recently appeared and has been misleading the people of <cf>[the city].
Is it not Einlein who has escaped from the ...... temple?
I do not deny that <cf>Master Einlein has wanderlust</cf>.
But you are <cf> doing your job well here.
Therefore, I can say with certainty that the oracle priestess who appeared in the city is <cf> a fake.
The oracle priestesses basically do not appear in public <cf> except for ceremonies and pilgrimages. I think that makes them easier to fake.
I see. ...... So, from the flow of the conversation, <cf>you want us to catch the impostor?
Yes, I do. As you know, due to the incident with the Duchy of Barnhart, <cf>the Order does not have the manpower to spare.
However, we can hire adventurers, but only because of the content of the contents. ...... <cf>What do you think?　<cf>Would you be willing to take on the job?
<cf>Would you be willing to take on the job? Leave it to me.
I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.
I'm also interested in the Einlein imposter. <cf> As my servant says, I'll do my part here.
As expected of the Gods of Buffalia. <cf>Thank you very much.
It is a fake, but one of the priests witnessed it just the other day. <cf>It would be better to speak to him directly.
There you are, priest!　You are the one who saw the impostor priestess?
Yes, I did. Master Lugerio has asked me to tell you the details.
It was in Berkmar that I saw the impostor priestess.
I go there <cf>regularly to pray for the victims of the destruction of the village.
When I went there, there were several former residents of the village, probably to clean up the mess.
And at the center of it all was the impostor.
I had never seen <cf> the face of the oracle priestess, so I did not know her <cf> face. ......
From the stories of the villagers, I had mistakenly assumed that she <cf>was</cf> there.
So I decided to take this opportunity to say hello to her, and when I spoke to her, she <cf> ran away.
I was troubled by her strange and impatient attitude, so <cf>I hurried back to the temple and reported the matter of Berkmar to her.
So it was a fake.
Yes. At that time, the oracle priestess was <cf>praying in the cathedral.
Hmmm... ....... What was the reaction of the people in Berkmar at that time?
They all praised the impostor. <cf>They were treated very well.
Not only did they pray for him, but they <cf>treated his injuries free of charge and helped him clean up the village.
You are not trying to [undermine] our reputation? ......
...... I'm ashamed to admit that if I hadn't run away, <cf>I might have believed it was real too!
She looked like a simple girl of 15-6 years old. <cf>She was graceful, kind, and had pure eyes.
I didn't <cf>think</cf> that the girl was up to anything,<cf> and ......
Still, you <cf>can't be sure that she was deceiving <cf>the oracle priestess's name.
Yes, yes....... That's right. ......
I'll ask the villagers about it. <cf>We would like to know what their impressions are of the impostor.
If that's the case, we'll leave for Berkmar as soon as possible!
Hmm?　What is it, you guys? <cf>Are you here on a wild goose chase in these ruins?
Sorry to bother you while you're cleaning up. I heard there was an oracle priestess around here.
Ah~ that's too bad. <cf> There was an oracle priestess here until the other day.
She really was a wonderful person. <cf>She was kind and compassionate. ......
<cf>To think that someone like that is leading a cult only increases my <cf>faith!
I see. I would love to meet him! <cf>By the way [--].
Was the oracle priestess alone? <cf>Any attendants or anything like that? ......
No, I was alone from the beginning. <cf>I wandered into this ruin and ......
["]Is there anything I can help you with?"] and <cf>proactively helped me out.
At first I thought it was some village girl, but <cf>the way she prayed for the victims was so divine. ......
Some village girl ......
Um, did the oracle priestess identify herself?
Well, she never came forward herself. ......
When someone called out "oracle priestess," she smiled <cf> like she was in trouble. She must have been a ninja.
I see. Thank you. <cf>Please do your best to clean up!
Oyoyo. <cf>I hope you guys get to meet the priestesses too!
Let me ask you something, <cf>Have you ever met a priestess of the oracle?
Yes, we have. Just the other day! <cf> Look, look. I got this injury from a priestess.
I accidentally cut my palm while cleaning up. <cf>The priestess noticed it and immediately treated me.
Really, you know,...... she's wonderful!
I wanted to thank her in some way, but she said, <cf>["Your smiles are the best thanks I can give you.
He is indeed a man who can hear the voice of God. <cf>He is different from us!
...... Excuse me, but <cf>was that person really an oracle priestess?
What are you talking about?　If that person was not the oracle's priestess, then <cf>who was?
Well, I guess she was a ninja, <cf>although she never said her name herself: ......
I see. <cf>Thank you for your story!
I guess you didn't identify yourself, after all. <cf>Hm......
Excuse me, do you <cf>know where the oracle priestess went?
If she's the oracle priestess, she went to Larpal. <cf>It's not safe for her to be alone, so I offered to send her to you.
[<cf>I was told, "[God's blessing], so I'll be fine.
I see. Thank you very much.
Mwah... ....... I don't feel refreshed. <cf>I'll give you some time to think about it.
First, let's get the information straight.
<cf>The impostor is a simple girl of 15-6 years old, <cf>who is so much a person that the third priest who witnessed her was smitten with her.
She is well-liked by the villagers who have met her, <cf>and she is very kind and thoughtful.
She also apparently acts alone, <cf>never calls herself an oracle priestess, but she doesn't deny it either.
...... When I first heard about her, I thought she was trying to take <cf> money out of Einlein's name.
At this point, there seems to be no sign of that. <cf>Or maybe they'll reveal their true nature after they win people's hearts and minds: ......
Let's go to Lalpar. It can't have been <cf>that long since the girl left here.
Let's go to Lalpar. <cf>It can't have been that long since the girl left.
That's right. Even if she had already left Larpal, <cf>we could at least pick up some information.
Priestess of the oracle!　Please accept this.
Thank you very much. <cf>But please, just your kindness is all I ask.
I cannot take it. <cf>Please share it with the others.
Miko-sama ...... how merciful!
Please excuse me from your story! <cf> Are you the priestess of the oracle?
We are affiliated with the Order. <cf> We are here to welcome the oracle priestess.
[--]!　Oh, um, I ......
Oh, I'm interrupting, aren't I? Well then. <cf>Thank you very much, miko-sama!
Now, let's get down to business. <cf> Let me get this straight, you are an imposter of the oracle priestess, aren't you?
I have received a request from the Order to search for you. <cf> I want you to come with me to the temple of the Asterlys.
......Yes. Understood.
Hmm?　You're so obedient. <cf>Are you going to resist or run away?
Because <cf> running away is futile if the cult knows of my existence. Besides, ......
I'm actually a little relieved. That I won't have to <cf>deceive the name of the oracle priestess anymore.
...... Before we go to the temple, can you tell me what's going on?
......I am an ordinary and unremarkable girl. <cf>My family used to say to me.
[You're the same whether you're here or not. <cf>You are like air.
One day, an oracle maiden stopped by the village and approached me.
It was just her voice through the door. ......<cf>["]You are not air. You are talking to me ["]"]
[I am having a good time during my pilgrimage because of you.
["]I am sure that my time with you is a <cf>gift</cf> from the God of Buffalia."] ......
Einlein is quite the <cf>thinker</cf> when you hear it like this: ......
For me, the words of the priestess were an oracle. <cf>Even an existence like mine can be useful to someone.
So I took the plunge and left home. I joined the Order<cf> to serve God and live a life of service, just like the miko.
......I helped people along the way, and <cf>the wheels fell out of place!
I was so happy when he thanked me. When he asked me my name, <cf>I couldn't help but say ["]I'm a priestess of the Order ["]<cf>.
Well, it was a personal ["]I am (will be) a priestess of the Order["]<cf>, but I was so excited that I was so excited. ......
And then, people who were there started asking me for advice <cf>on problems one after another.
It's nice to be asked for help, so <cf>I sincerely tried to solve their problems[--].
Eventually, someone started calling me <cf>a priestess of the oracle</cf> ......
Wouldn't it have been better if I had denied it on the spot?
When I saw your expectant eyes, I felt <cf> uncomfortable to say that I was not, and I continued to do so. ......
I knew it was wrong. <cf>I knew I shouldn't have been misunderstood by the oracle priestess.
But I didn't want to cloud everyone's faces. <cf>I was afraid of disappointing them!
So now that ...... they've come to get me like this, <cf>I feel more liberated!
I can finally ...... be punished ......
I know you have no ill will toward me. <cf>All that I have just told you, you may tell me in the temple.
I know you will not be made to feel so bad......
No, I will receive whatever punishment I deserve. <cf>I have deceived the name of a respected oracle priestess, of all people!
Muuu....... In the meantime, let's take this girl under <cf>Lugerio's wing.
[And well, this girl's deception of the oracle maiden's name started with <cf>a misunderstanding of the people around her.
The girl herself has no sinister intentions, <cf>she has only a motive of wanting to be of help to others,
<cf>she was just afraid of disappointing the people around her by denying <cf>the misconception that she was the oracle's priestess.
......I see. I see what you mean.
What a pure heart you have. <cf>This is too much to simply punish.
What do you think, Mr. Lugerio? <cf>As for this girl, I say that her sentence will be reduced [--].
As a priest, don't let your emotions get the better of you.
Regardless of the circumstances, the crime of making her think she is a priestess of the oracle is a serious one. <cf>It is the same as having conspired against the god of Buffalia.
No, but this girl has helped others and gained the respect of <cf>the oracle priestess</cf>, hasn't she?
It's okay. I'm ready for it.
I did not mean to offend. But sin is sin. <cf>I have conspired against the gods, and I must be punished.
Why don't you try to stand on your own feet a little?
I originally intended to serve God in body and soul.
Mr. Lugerio......
...... you are ready to serve and <cf> martyr yourself to God?
Yes, I am. It was the words of the oracle priestess that gave <cf>me</cf> meaning to my existence, even though I was like air.
I would be more than happy if you would <cf> punish the god of Buffalia whom that priestess serves!
...... understand. <cf> Then, as chief priestess, I pronounce the sentence.
You will work under the oracle priestess <cf>Master Einlein</cf> from this day forward.
What ......?
Oh!
You should learn under a real oracle priestess. If you love God and are willing to follow <cf> his will, we will accept you!
Oh ...... thank you! <cf>I will work hard!　I offer myself to God!
Good. Then, after you have given thanks to God, <cf>ask the priest there to show you the way.
Oh, good. You are <cf> one of us serving God today. Let us work together!
You are a mean one, too. <cf>If you were going to forgive, you should have done so from the beginning.
I thought your intention to be a martyr to God was genuine. <cf>If I had been different, I would have sentenced you to severe punishment.
...... By the way, what is severe punishment?
<cf>Those who [conspire] against God do not deserve to breathe on this earth. <cf>It is the same for those of us in our cult: ......
If I or Einlein were to act against God <cf>, we would be punished in the same way.
We always serve God with that much resolve. <cf>Please do not forget that. ......
Oh, hey. Are you alright, my lord?
Lalaforte...... I'm tired from singing too much......
Oh,...... it's hard to take turns singing, <cf>even if it's to create offerings to the gods!
No, no, no. It is a prestigious and important job, and <cf>we can't afford to be weak at this level!
...... but I can't <cf>deny</cf> that it's stressful. ......
Normally, I <cf>relieve stress with all my students in my singing class. ......
A singing class, you say?
Yes...Â It's a part of the service activities of the congregation.
I would be the teacher, and we would have <cf>singing classes for congregants and non congregants alike!
The LaLaforte singing class, I loved it too. ...... <cf>I will miss that one: ......
Thank you, Einlein. <cf>I miss it too: ......
I sent out a notice the other day that classes are back in session. <cf>With the cut in publicity costs, it didn't get everyone's attention for a while.
I think as long as the students come back, we can reopen ....... <cf>I would also ask Lugerio for more ......
So, I'd like you to <cf>send the news of reopening to the students......
What a quick and natural request!
Please do the same from me. <cf>It is also important to create a stress-free work environment!
Yes, yes, okay, okay. <cf>We'd be in trouble without the chronograms.
Where are those students now?
Where are those students now?
Well, they've been scattered about.
If we could get in touch with the five who were playing a central role, we could <cf> get the word out to the whole group. ......
I heard that one of them used to show up at a place called <cf>"Rudder Wheel Pavilion".
Her name is Grace. <cf>She might know where the other students are.
Please contact me at ....... <cf>We'll do our duty well. ......
<cf>Don't worry, Grace is at the "Quartermaster's Pavilion" first. <cf>Don't worry, we'll take care of it!
Oh, what is it?　A message from the temple?
...... Well, the singing classes are back in session! <cf>It's so nice to hear you sing again, Lara!
Lara, your songs always inspire me. <cf>Thanks for bringing the news to us.
Lalaforte has asked me to <cf>find the five main people:</cf> ......
Yup, one of them is in Asterlys. <cf>I'll give him a call!
Oh, that's great!
The other three are a bit far away. ...... <cf>Could you contact them for me?
Of course.
Then please, they should be in <cf>Lalpar, Ritze, and Salamzat, respectively.
I'm sure they'll fly in when they hear the news of the reopening. <cf>This is going to be fun!
<cf>Well done, I'm sure we'll be able to get to them. <cf>Well, let's go where we can!
Hi, do I have something on my face? <cf> Hmm?　Is this an announcement from the ...... temple?
Wow!　Lalaforte's singing class is starting up again? <cf>I'm going, I'm definitely going!
You should try it too! <cf>It's a lot of fun and you'll have a great voice!
<cf>Yes, I can't let this happen. <cf>I'll have to contact everyone else!

Me?　Yes, I'm a student in the singing class. <cf>[--]What?　You're going to do the class again?　Really?
I'm so happy! <cf>I love Lalaforte's singing class, it's fun!
I have some students in this village, so I'll give her a call! <cf>I'm sure everyone will be very happy!
...... An?　What's up with you guys? <cf>You want something from me?
Singing class. ......?　Ha, no such thing ......
<span size="Big">Of course I'm going! </>
I can't tell you how hard it has been <cf>not being able to see you, Lalaforte!
I thought I would <cf>die</cf> if I was deprived of that sun-like smile and angelic voice. ......
Ugh...... I'm so glad to be alive......! <cf>Thank you, God!
Okay, let's keep going and see what else we can find!
Okay, that's all we have. <cf>Let's go back to the "Quartermaster's Pavilion" in Asterlys.
Grace will be calling on the other one.
Oh?　Welcome back.
Mm-hmm. We're all good here. <cf>They're probably at the temple by now.
What about you? <cf> Did you find the student you said you would call on?
Yes, it's him. ......<cf> He has a little favor to ask [--].
Hah......Lalaforte,....... <cf>The time we didn't see each other made us love each other......
Oops, excuse me......If singing classes are going to resume, <cf>we need something to celebrate, don't we?
So I thought to myself. <cf> brightly colored flowers in the image of Ms. Lalaforte: ......
<cf>A wonderful flower that can express that gentle voice like melting snow: ......
Zubari "Mizushiragiku"! <cf> Let's make a bouquet of it and give it to her!
[--]So, will you do me a favor?
...... You want me to <cf>pick up a "meadowsweet" or something like that, don't you?
Yes, please. <cf> They should be blooming in the Andorra Basin this time of year.
<cf> Yes, yes, yes, yes. <cf>Servant, one more task.
Oh, that's a magnificent 'mizushiragiku'! <cf>Mr. Lalaforte will love this one!
Thank you, boys. <cf>Well, I'm off to the classroom!
Thanks for everything. You really helped me out! <cf>So, I'm off to class too!
Oh dear. ....... <cf>Well, we'll be on our way to see what's going on.
Thank you so much! <cf>Thanks to you, we have heard from students one after another!
<cf>We will open a class as soon as possible. <cf>I've also invited Charlotte to be our first special instructor!
<cf>We hope you will join us!
Singing Classroom...... Well, it's a nice change of pace. <cf>Let's take a peek!
Love!　Love!　Love!　LOVE!　Lalaforte!!!
Best today!　Always the best! <cf>Sai ko ko ko I love you!
Thanks again for the great calls today! <cf>I'd love to hear your responses too!
Already!　<cf>Please call me too, not just Lalaforte!
I'd love to hear your response!
<span size="Big">What the hell! </>
I can sing songs not related to Buffalism or <cf>trendy songs</cf> as long as they are limited to this course!
It's a great stress reliever, isn't it? <cf>Come on, let's sing together!
Ye[---]☆☆
Yeah[-----]Yeah☆
Yeah [......]Yeah [---]yeah
Even the oracle priestess is ....... <cf>No, my head is starting to hurt......
Come on, you guys, let's sing and dance!　Let's sing and dance!
Come on, let's have some fun! <cf>Ye[---]yay!
Yeah!
Here comes the next song!　Oh, it's fun!
....... <cf>...... I was wondering what all the fuss was about, but it was more than I expected.
Lalaforte asked me to teach singing, but <cf>I guess it's a good thing I didn't take him up on the offer.
I'd rather be reading history books than singing. <cf>So, the archives stacks: ......
Oh, I found Myrlene!
What?
You came, Myrlene-san! <cf>I'm so glad!
Oh, no, I was just passing by, that's different [--].
Oh, wow, three divas all together! <cf> Great situation!　Hot!
Okay, we're going into overtime☆<cf>More than ever, we're going to make you a prisoner of our song...
Ye[-----]!
Ye-[----]y!
Yea[......]!
Yeah!
That's why I'm different!
Hmmm!　I still like the song!
Huh ...... I'm worried about you ......
Hmm?　What's wrong with your gloomy face? Are you worried about something?
I think you and Feste-chan are the hopefuls, aren't you? <cf>...... come to think of it, you guys have been getting along well with the Order lately, haven't you?
Well, we often receive requests.
Do you meet with oracle priestesses by any chance? ......<cf>?
......Well, to a certain extent?
I see!　Hey, how is the priestess? <cf>Are you really sick or something?
What, all of a sudden?
Look, the opening ceremony of the Hoshirei Matsuri. <cf>I'm sure you've only heard the opening declaration, right? <cf> Usually there's a story, but this year there wasn't.
It doesn't feel like a Hoshirei Matsuri without that. <cf>The priestess looked a little tired even during the opening declaration. ......
<cf>There's a rumor going around that something might have happened.
I see...that's what you mean. <cf>Well, ...... I think she was just busy, right?
It's unheard of for a priestess to not speak at a seirei festival,<cf> but how can she be so busy?
Yes, I'm worried. I can only think <cf>something happened in the skirmish with the principality the other day.
I wonder if she is too sick to talk. Or is it an injury? <cf>I suggest you send something invigorating to ......
Calm down!　The oracle priestess said it's really okay.
Even if you say so, hey. ......
<cf>I can't help it. <cf>I'll let them know you're worried about them.
<cf>We'll take good care of you. <cf>All the guests who come here are worried about you, too!
<cf>Well, then, let's go to the temple. Then let us go to the temple. <cf>We must let them know that we are all concerned about the oracle priestess.
YOKOSHO ....... <cf>Well, I'm tired indeed. ......
Woah!　What's this pile of gifts!
Oh, this is a tribute to Ainrain-sama!
<cf> People who were concerned about the health of Master Einlein brought him gifts one after another like this.
We are very grateful, but there are so many that <cf>it's hard to carry them to the storage place. ......
Hmmm... ....... It seems that more people are worried about <cf>Einlein</cf> than we think.
Let's go to the [Seido] of [Tengei]. <cf> We must tell Einlein the details of what happened.
How are you?　Einlein. <cf>I saw a pile of gifts in the temple just now.
Yeah. ...... <cf> They all seem to be ...... worried about me. ......
Yes, that's right. In fact, we were asked to <cf>check up on you</cf>.
The people in town seem to think that <cf>you are not feeling well</cf> because you didn't speak to them at the Seirei Festival.
...... I'm in good health.
I didn't tell you about the doctrine because <cf>I haven't been able to leave here much. ......
I gave the congregation a break, <cf>for they always help me maintain the warding.
I wanted them to enjoy the Hoshrei Festival at least. ......
So you spend more time here.
....... <cf>I can't tell everyone about the warding ......
I really didn't mean to worry you.
And yet, I even got a gift. ...... <cf>Lugerio says it's good to have your faith confirmed, but ......
I feel like I'm fooling everyone......<cf>I told ......
Do you want to tell everyone ...... not to worry?
I'd like to ....... If I could. <cf>But Lugerio says, 'Don't say anything unnecessary' ......
Hm. As was the case in the Principality,<cf> it's okay if I leave here for a little while, isn't it?
Yes. The congregation is back now. ......
Then how about an impromptu mini-mini storytelling session?
How about a spur-of-the-moment ...... mini-mini ......?
I'm sure there are a lot of people who would like to hear you speak. <cf> If you do a spur-of-the-moment event in the city, Lugerio won't be able to stop you.
I'd like to ...... do that. ......
Good!　Then let's see where we can find a place......<cf>Well, since we're here, let's do it where the cook is.
He will be relieved when he sees Einlein's<cf>healthy appearance with his own eyes!
What? <cf>The oracle priestess is going to hold a story-telling session here!
Mm. <cf> In a short time, and in secret from the Order. <cf>As long as everyone can see the priestess in good health!
That's why we'd like to borrow some of your space.
In that case, you can use the balcony there. <cf>The people outside will be able to see the miko.
<cf>I'm sorry, but that's a lot of responsibility. I'm starting to shiver. <cf>I'm sure there will be a lot of people there. ......
Yes, I'm sure!　Maybe I should <cf>serve something to the people who will gather for the miko's storytelling session!
Ah~!　But I'm just now getting the ingredients......<cf>I should have stocked up on more if this is the case!
Hmmm?　If there's anything missing, we'll get it for you.
Really?　That would be great! <cf>Well, we'll take you at your word.
<cf>What we especially need right now is meat. <cf>I need you to get us some fresh ones.
Okay, I've undertaken to do that. <cf> In exchange, I'll rent this place for free, okay?
Ha ha!　That's very solid!　All right. <cf>I'm not trying to take money from the miko to begin with.
<cf>See this note for the ingredients you need. Please procure them for me! <cf>Now, we have to get ready to welcome the miko!
...... Skyfish, shrimp mushrooms, and crab spider meat, huh? <cf>Okay, let's get some live ones!
Here, I've got the ingredients.
Thanks, that's a big help! <cf> Actually, we've already got quite a few people here.
I told only the regulars about the priestess storytelling session, but <cf>it went around and quite a few ......
Good, good. It's only for a short time. Besides, <cf>I think the priestess would feel more comfortable if there were a certain number of people there.
Well, we're all set. <cf>So let's begin our spur-of-the-moment mini-mini story-telling session!
...... So that we do not wake the beast, <cf> we will reflect and be compassionate <cf> every day ......
I'm so relieved to hear that you're doing well, miko!
<cf>And to be so close to you and to hear your words of gratitude. <cf>But still, ......
Yes, I know. But still, it's really [--].
<span size="Big">Boring ......! </>
...... yes?
But that's good[--].
<cf>The miraculous boredom produced by the boredom of the story itself and the "pause" peculiar to the miko!
This has become a habit of mine. I can't stand it. <cf>My ears, or rather, my body, is asking for it. ......
What a ......<cf> world you don't want to understand much......?
A layman can't understand it[--].
Alright. I see that Einlein's story has some<cf>weird fans.
Well, I'm sure they'll be relieved <cf>when word gets out that we're hosting a storytelling session here.
Well, perhaps it's time to start ......
What are you doing here? <cf>Master Einlein!
I thought it was about time the sentry spotted you! <cf> Let's get out of here!　Einlein, my servant!
<cf>Sir Einlein, your servant!　See you all at ......!
Hey, hey! <cf>Wait, Einlein-sama!
Thank you, miko! <cf>I'll let everyone know that you were well!
Wow, the priestess has a smile befitting her age, doesn't she?
That was adorable. <cf>Oh, but really as I expected [--].
That was a boring story!
Haha ...... I'm glad the Star Festival went off without a hitch, but ......
Myrlene is still ......
I just came to check up on you ......<cf> and you look very depressed, don't you?
Oh, well!　Thank you very much for your help. <cf>You were related to the Order, weren't you?
<cf>I saw you and Mr. Lugerio talking very friendly at the Seiryoku Festival.
Well, I think it's a misnomer to say "friendly," but I suppose it's fair to say that you are related to him.
Were you also present at the Hoshinrei Festival?
Yes. <cf>Although I am kept away from it, <cf>I am also a part of the priesthood, you know. Besides [--].
I was also<cf> concerned about Myrlene, who had become a diva.
......How is Myrlene doing after that?
I thought she would come back here <cf>after the Star Festival,</cf> but there is no sign of her at all.
Don't worry. He is doing his duty in good health! <cf> Well, in exchange for the books and documents in the temple.
Haha, that sounds like a thing!
I saw her sing at the ...... Seiryoku Festival, <cf>and it was magnificent!
I still think she's going to end up on the ...... singing path!
Wait a minute. I don't think so, do you? <cf>Now she just can't go back because she still has work to do.
Diva is an honorable job. <cf>It's different from being an ordinary historical researcher with no backing.
She would be happier living as a diva. <cf>Yes, she would. It must be so. No, yes.
No, no, I'll check with him first to see if he is willing [--].
I'm sorry to trouble you, but could you please give this paper to <cf>Mirlene</cf>?
It is a joint research project with her, completed by me. <Consider it a parting gift from my mentor to a disciple who is moving on to a new path.
<cf>Oops, he just finished it all on his own without listening to me.
I used to debate with him whenever I saw him, but <cf>that won't happen anymore, will it?
I'm happy and sad to see him leave the nest......<cf>heh......
Oh, ...... no good, this one. <cf>I'm completely in my own world.
It can't be helped. I'm going to deliver this paper to Myrlene. <cf>And then we'll just have to have a discussion between master and disciple.
What's the matter? <cf>The offerings are not ready yet.
It is a gift from Wahlkin to you. <cf>"Consider this paper as a parting gift from the master," he said.
A [parting gift]......?
He thought you'd quit your career as a researcher and go on to become a diva.
Huh?　Huh? <cf>What's that?　That's not even a good misunderstanding!
I never said anything about quitting my research career! <cf>I only accepted the position of diva in exchange for the temple materials!
That's what we said, <cf>but you seem to go straight to the point once you've made up your mind.
<cf>She's like a ...... teacher. ...... <cf>That kind of stubbornness shows in his research, too.
Sorry, but you and I will have to discuss this further. <cf>Well then, we'll [--].
If this happens, let's thoroughly examine every inch of this paper so that <cf>you can get a sense of how serious I am. That is the only way!
So, I'd like to ask you guys <cf>to do a field survey as soon as possible, okay?
Wow, you are indeed a master and disciple. <cf>You got me involved so easily!
Because I <cf>can't leave the temple for long periods of time due to my duties as a diva!
So I ask you. <cf>I'll sing for the offerings properly. Right?
...... I have no choice. I'm entrusted.
Thank you!　Well, let's take a quick look, <cf>I knew I was missing some material here.
I've been talking to the doctor about it for a while now, but <cf>I've given up halfway through because it's too dangerous.
The bossy monster brought it into his den,<cf> and we've been having trouble confirming it for years!
That's why I'm asking you to go to a place called "Sopra's [mountain path]" <cf>and collect a little bit of relics!
I know I'm asking a lot of you, but <cf>I said I'd do it, so do your best, my servant!
<cf>I'm trusting in your skills, that's why. <cf>Thank you!
Alright!　<cf>You've got the relics that Myrlene asked for!
Let's get it to her ASAP!
There, I've brought you the relic, as you requested.
That's great!　Thank you! <cf>Thank goodness we asked you guys to do this!
Well, I'll call you when I've finished verifying the paper. <cf>Till then, you'll have to wait a bit.
Phew! ...... With this relic, I'm going to blow away the ridiculous assumption that I <cf>quit being a researcher!
The humiliation of being corrected by my students, <cf>I'll make sure you have plenty of it, doctor. ......
A few days later[--].
Thanks for your hard work on ....... <cf>I've finished validating your paper~......
You look amazing. ...... <cf>Have you been sleeping well?
Did you sleep 3 hours in 3 days ...... or ......?
That doesn't count as sleeping!
I'm fine. I was doing my duty. <cf>More importantly, I wanted to clear up your misunderstanding as soon as possible.
So, yes. Please deliver this corrected and red-covered <cf>humiliated paper to your teacher!
...... because if you read this, you'll know how serious I am.
It's a complicated master-disciple relationship. ...... <cf>All right. I'll make sure to deliver it, so you go to bed.
Yeah. ...... <cf>Thank you then~......
...... Oh, I forgot. Message to the teacher. <cf>["]............["]]
......Yeah, got it.
......Yeah, got it.
Please do me a favor! <cf>This is a delivery from Myrlene!
This is ...... the paper I sent ......?
[She said, "[Read this and you'll see] how serious I am.
Mm...... it's full of corrections, isn't it? ......
Hmm, I see. ...... <cf>You certainly didn't do a good enough job of comparing and contrasting Document 1 and Document 2.
Problem with the cited documents?　There is a paper older than this ......<cf> Oh, in the closed stacks of the Temple. I can't get my hands on this one.
Mm?　I'm sure Myrlene is too forceful in her conclusions. <cf>What you say has a point, but it's just a theory!
Oh, and here and here: ......! <cf>Totally, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm ......!
A message from Myrlene. <cf>["]Someday, I will defeat you [completely]! ["]"]
I see. Ha-ha!　That seems to be the one!
It seems I was mistaken. <cf> She had absolutely no intention of quitting her job as a researcher.
I'm ashamed of myself for having assumed that on my own. <cf> No, I'm only sorry.
It's true. <cf>Well, master and disciples are all in a straight line when they think something is right.
<cf>At the moment, I have my duties as a diva, but <cf>he is using them for research.
<cf>When she has completed her duties, she will return in due time. <cf>You can wait until then.
Yes, that's right. <cf>But I cannot neglect my master while my apprentice works so hard.
I will <cf>prepare a new paper that I can be proud of to her as a teacher and wait for her!
That is why I will head out for a field survey as soon as possible! <cf>Then!
<cf>Wait!　You are not to go alone! <cf>You want to get lost again!
The master will not be defeated, Myrlene!　If you come back, I will beat you <cf>[completely]!
Hmm?　You are Merlouf, aren't you?
Hello, boys. You look well.
We met here, but for the hundredth time! <cf> Today is the time to tell us who you are!
Who are you? <cf> What are you doing here in the first place?
Merlouf, you are [--]Oh, you're listening to me!
Yes. ...... Quiet a bit. I'm looking for you.
Looking for ......?　What [--]
[--] I found it.
Whoa!　He's flying away again! <cf> No kidding, that's always the pattern!
You said you were looking for ....... <cf>What exactly are you looking for? ......
I'm curious. Let's follow it.
I'm curious. Let's follow it.
Hmmm. This is a good opportunity. <cf> Let's get a little closer to who that thing is!
It's flying off into the desert. <cf> Let's see what's in store for us at ....... Let's keep our heads up!
There he is!　Merlouf!
We met here a thousand years ago! <cf> This time it's your turn.
What's up with the kid?
Hello, hello again.
I saved you from being attacked by a monster.
We've come this far. <cf>The rest is up to these guys to get rid of the monsters.
Hmmm?　It's admirable that you saved them, but did I say something that you didn't want me to hear?
<cf>That's why I'm asking you to take care of the monsters. <cf>I'm sure you'll get some good training.
Don't push it so easily!
Oh, you're abandoning us? <cf>That's terrible for such a pretty little girl.
...... We have no choice. I accept.
Thank you. You are indeed a bastard child of hope.
You should take a good look at how this guy fights. <cf>There's a lot to learn from him.
Ha, yes!
Muuu...... I feel like I've been talked out of it, but I can't help it. <cf>Let's go, my servant!
<cf>Wow, I'm so proud of myself!　I beat that monster! <cf>Wow, wow, wow!　That's cool!
Ho-ho-ho! <cf>That's what I and my servants can do!
What do you think?　Did you learn something?
Yes, I did!　I want to be strong like him!
That's a good attitude. <cf>But let's start by protecting ourselves first.
You seem to have some skill, but <cf>it's too dangerous to come to a place like this alone!
You mustn't misjudge your own strength.
I'm sorry ......
Why are you alone in the first place?
...... excuse me, <cf>I knew it was dangerous!
But I really <cf> wanted some medicinal herbs that I could only get here.
My neighbor's uncle is suffering from an injury. <cf>I couldn't stand to see that, so I ......
Is it recklessness out of goodness or ......
I think I was <cf>so smug because I was stronger than the other kids.
If my brother and you guys hadn't come along, <cf>I probably would have died without anyone knowing about it.
......And in the end, I couldn't have done anything on my own.
To be strong, it's important to look at <cf> yourself like that.
Face your failures without turning away from them. <cf>It sounds easy, but it's a very difficult task.
I admire you for being able to do that. <cf>I hope you keep that honesty in your heart.
...... yes!
Well, I'll help you with the herbs. <cf>A reward for your honesty!
Oops!　What's wrong with you today? <cf> Every word you say makes my horns itch. Itchy!
Phew. Naturally, you guys are going to help me out, right?
I'm not going to ...... well, it's a boat I'm getting on.
Come on, then, let's all get our hands on some herbs. Let's go for it!
Is this enough herbs?
Not just enough, but enough to make change! <cf> With this, I'm sure your uncle's injuries will get better!
Yes, then you can deliver them quickly. <cf>Are you sure you can handle it from here by yourself?
Yes, it's just around the corner. <cf>While I was gathering medicinal herbs, I also checked to see if there were any monsters!
I see. Well, take care. <cf>See you again somewhere.
Yes, sir!　Thank you all so much! <cf> I'll definitely be strong!　Bye then!
Case closed, huh? <cf> You were just so kind to me, it was scary!
I switch the response I take depending on the subject. <cf>I've been [so...][u...][i...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...][u...
Then be nice to us, too! <cf> Even though there are such superbly beautiful girls!
You have possessed a certain amount of power from the very beginning. <cf>Then there should be no need for me to respond in kind!
The conversation is not exquisitely appropriate. <cf>I'm tired of talking with you.
...... She was a good, positive girl, but <cf>was she the one you were looking for?
Yes, she was. As a thank you for helping me, I <cf>may</cf> tell you.
I was looking for that girl, or rather, a girl who has the potential to become as strong as that girl.
I'm sure she will be very strong physically and mentally in the future.
He wants to help others and is willing to sacrifice himself<cf> to do so. That heart is the first step to becoming a hero.
I travel all over the world to help and guide these children.
Is that part of the reason you're here? <cf>You seek "strength" because you want to raise heroes?
You are half right. The other half is [--]
[--]Too bad. <cf>This time, with your work, you can only answer so far!
Oh, this pattern again? <cf> You coward!　Don't fly away [---]!
To lead us to our heroes, huh? ......
...... Why does he want to be a <cf>hero</cf> so badly?
Suppose he and his servants become strong enough to be called heroes.
What does he want next......?
Erinse...... Mr....... that......
Yes, sir. Yes, sir?
Well, that...... I......<cf> Mr. Erlinse's...... sa, sa, sai......
Sa?
......, it's nothing. Excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Einlein!
Einlein ran, <cf>What's wrong?
That's what I don't understand, sir.
Sometimes he calls out to me like that, but <cf>he says something to me and then goes away. ......
What is my <cf>......?
I see. <cf>Maybe they want your autograph?
Oh! Surely it sounds like a signature? <cf> But is it my ......?
<cf>Einlein, despite his appearance, has a surprisingly mundane side to him.
<cf>The god he espouses is right in front of him. <cf>I'm sure he'd love to get a testimonial from you.
But he's too proud and too shy<cf>to say so....... Is that about it?
Well,...... if that's the case, <cf> what a cute request!
But, are you sure you <cf>want</cf> my signature?
My signature is <cf>not</cf> any kind of authority. ......
But I'm still happy about it. <cf>That's what longing is all about.
I see. ...... Well then, as a token of my appreciation, <cf>I will give you my autograph, Mr. Einlein.
<cf>But it wouldn't be very tasteful if I just wrote it. <cf>I would like to surprise her with other gifts as well.
Oh, that sounds fun. <cf>In that case, we will cooperate!
Thank you very much. By the way, what would Einlein <cf>love</cf>?
Ummm...... she loves singing, so <cf>something related to singing would be good, wouldn't it?
That's good! <cf>Well, then, let's ask someone who knows a lot about singing to help us out!
Speaking of singing, Charlotte and Lalaforte are ......<cf>friends of Einlein.
They are close to Einlein, so they might just blurt it out at any moment. If that's the case,[--]<cf>the right person for the job would be Myrlene, who has a good sense of distance.
If you are Myrlene, <cf>you just went to dinner at the Mermaid.
Mermaid. All right, let's go there.
Oh, there she is. <Myrlene, lend me a little of your knowledge.
What?　Something troubling you about history?
I'm afraid that's another matter. <cf> I have a question about singing.
I would like to give a <cf> secret gift of gratitude</cf> to Ms. Einlein, who has always been so kind to me.
So, I was wondering if there is <cf>any good gift that relates to her favorite songs. ......
I see. Songs, songs, yeah. ...... <cf>Well, the standard gift would be to give her a song of her own composition.
<cf>Well, the standard gift would be a song of one's own composition, but that's a bit of a hurdle. <cf>The person receiving the gift may also be sensitive about it.
Then, ...... hmmm......
I agree!　How about a music box?
A music box......?
The kind with a collection of the latest popular songs. The look and the mechanism inside is <cf> so cute, it's all the rage amongst the girls!
<cf>They are handmade one by one by artisans in Kanaloa. <cf>Whenever they come in, they are sold out immediately.
It's what we call a rare item. <cf>I'm sure they'd be happy to receive them as gifts.
It's a good idea, but they sell out quickly, don't they? <cf>I'm not a fan of hard-to-find items. ......
<cf>It seems that people who really want them go directly to Canaroa to buy them!
I see!　Buying locally is a possibility.
Then, I and my servant will go to Canaroa!
Um, am I ......?
Erlinse, you should stay in the temple. If you disappear, <cf>Mr. Einlein will get suspicious. You don't want to tell her, do you?
Certainly, yes. <cf>Then I will be waiting for you in the temple.
<cf>Then I will be waiting for you in the temple. Wait for the good news.
Now, where is the rumored music box maker ......
Hmm?　Are you guys here to buy a <cf> music box by any chance?
Oh, how did you know?
Lately, all the other people who come here <cf>are here for the music boxes.
But, well, you're adventurers, aren't you? <cf>I guess I came at the right time. ......
<cf>Maybe the music box has just been finished?
At any rate, ask the craftsman directly. <cf>He'll be roaring on the beach.
Roar ......?
Help him out. See ya~!
I have a bad feeling about this, but I think I'll go to the ...... beach.
Ummm......... what to do.........
You are really groaning......
You're the popular music box maker? <cf> We're here to buy a music box [--].
Oh, wow!　I'm sorry! <cf> Sorry we missed the deadline!
No, it's not that we were slacking, it's just that we couldn't get the parts, so...[--]
Calm down!　We're your customers!
Huh?　Oh, that's right. I'm not the head of the company. ......
I'm sorry to show you the embarrassing part. We're on deadline <cf> and we can't make the numbers and we're trapped. ......
Is it the parts that aren't being delivered in time?
Yes. We ran out of <cf>"precision gears," which are essential for making music boxes. ......
We asked an adventurer to find a substitute, but he refused, saying it was <cf>too dangerous</cf>. ......
Substitutes?　How do you get them?
There is a <cf>[PM (proto-machina)] Mook Elder</cf> in a place called "The Abandoned Mines of Miasma",
The right gear is used as a part of him!
Hmmm... ...... Well, shall we take care of that request for you?
What?　Is that OK? <cf>The other party is Machina!
<cf>In return, when you get the gears, make us a music box <cf>before anyone else does!
Yeah, with hazard pay, <cf>and a special edition that's a little different from the rest, okay?
Uh, yeah! <cf>We'll do it, please!
If you kill three or so of the "[PM (proto-machina)] Mook Elder", <cf>you'll have enough of them!
Well, we've come to an agreement! <cf>Leave it in our hands without worry!
Is this the cog you requested?
Oh, this is it! <cf>Yay, now we can resume making music boxes!
<cf>I'll make one for you guys right away. <cf>As promised, I'll make it a bit special!
Yes, it's ready. <cf>How about this one?
Oh, it's beautiful! <cf>Well, this will certainly be popular!
<cf>Yours is a different color from the regular ones. <cf>This is a very limited edition, only one in this color!
<cf>I like it! <cf>This would make a good gift!
Now, I'll take this one. <cf>We need to get a few more before the ex-patriots arrive!
<cf> Let's go back to Asterlys. <cf>First we have to get this to Erinze.
Thanks for your help. How was the music box?
I got it successfully. <cf>And it's a special edition, different from the usual!
Well, as expected! <cf>I'm sure Einlein will be pleased!
Now all that's left to do is the finishing touches. <cf>Write your signature here and there.
I'm kind of nervous. ......
......Yes, it's done! <cf>This is a music box with my signature!
<cf>Well, it's beautifully written, isn't it? <cf>Well, let's get it to Einlein right away!
Ms. Einlein. <cf>Would you accept this?
Huh?　What?　Why, ......
It's a thank you for all the help you have always given me. <cf>I hope you like it. ......
Eh...... Oh, no....... <cf>Taking care of you is just a matter of course......
Just take it. <cf>It's not every day you get a gift from God, you know?
Feste and the others helped us with this. <cf>So please accept it.
So...... then...... excuse me......
...... Wow!　This is a trendy music box! <cf>But the color is ......?
It's specially made just for you. <cf>And turn it over and look at the bottom!
The bottom ......?　Ah, oh!
God's signature!
I hope I haven't <cf>damaged the value of the music box with my signature. ......
That's not what I meant ......!　Thank you very much! <cf>I can't believe that God would give me an autographed gift......
...... I myself am not such an adored <cf>person!
...... Erinze?
Certainly, some of the God-families are wonderful. <cf>But ......
As a decorated royalty, I just live in <cf>peace in a boxy court, and I have nothing to be proud of......
...... but Erinse, you came here for <cf> the future of the planet......
And now you are <cf> trying your best to save your friend Tirith, ...... so ......
It's not like I haven't done anything.
Ms. Einlein ......
You show us such a figure, Ms. Erinze,......<cf>I still admire you,......
Ms. Einlein. <cf>Will you be my friend?
I don't care if you are a priestess of the oracle or a Buffalian goddess, <cf>I want to talk to you as a friend.
is ...... yes ......! <cf>But ...... what, if I speak ......
Well, first of all, tell me <cf>about the latest popular song in the music box.
I'm not very good at this kind of thing. ......
Yes, I am! <cf> Well, ...... there are three songs in all. ......
Oh, man, you two are a pain in the ass.
But I'm glad you two became friends.
Yes, I'm sure we are.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　Einlein, <cf>he's getting excited and starting to sing!
Run away, my servant. <cf>I'll lose my temper if I keep hearing that offbeat sound!
（<cf>You mustn't run away from your friend's song, <cf> you mustn't ...... do that!)
Oh, behold my servant. Be patient and continue to <cf>listen to Einlein's song, Eirinse!
That is the way to respect friendship. ...... How beautiful. ......
......There are many kinds of friendship!
......There's a lot to be said for friendship!
......That's all for this damage report!
Well, thank you!
Monsters around the forest are more active than before.
If this continues, there will be deaths sooner or later. <cf>Before that happens, I would appreciate your thoughts, my queen.
However, I would like to ......
I would like to boost everyone's morale with the Queen's words. <cf>Please, please, let the queen herself give us instructions[--].
...... and do as you wish!
Dear Pipimarca: ......
......Yes, sir. <cf>I will make a decision here in a little while.
Hah......
You ....... <cf>You have come. <cf>Did you see the exchange we just had?
Ah~...... sorry. I came at a bad time.
No, that's okay. No matter when you come, <cf>I will still expose my pathetic appearance.
I'm not pathetic. ......
Don't worry about it. <cf>It's even harder when you do.
The more I ...... settle down, the more I think about it. <cf>Kapakuk forgave me, but [--].
<cf>I have deceived the people for the sake of my daughter, <cf>am I really qualified to be a queen?
I wonder what power there is in such words of mine. ......
I am sorry. If it's not urgent, can we talk later? <cf> I'm a little tired......
You seem to be very tired, Mr. Pipimaruka.
That's understandable. I had to deal with my daughter. <cf>But I didn't realize you had lost so much confidence.
......We are also in a position to lead our people. <cf>I understand your anguish, Mr. Pipimarca.
I wish I could somehow cheer you up. ......
Muu....... <cf>I should talk to Kapakuk about this.
How to restore the queen's confidence: ......, you say?
Mm. Pipimaruka seems to have lost a lot of confidence in her own judgment.
After all, it would not be good for the people of the forest if she continues like this, <cf> even though the matter of the divine spirit has been settled.
...... I'd like to know how to do that.
I, as a member of the forest, would like to support <cf>Master Phi Phi Malka</cf>.
But no matter what I say, it will never reach the depths of his heart. He will always be alone.
......I can't be of help to that One if I'm nothing like him[--].
Don't be so self-deprecating as to say, 'just like me.'
is ......?
Certainly, the heart of those on top is lonely. <cf>But[--].
If you know that there is one person who cares for you from the bottom of his heart,<cf> then you are not alone at that moment!
Truly,...... just one person can make a ......<cf> person stronger in a strange way!
(......This is Erinze's real experience, I suppose.)
<cf>Master Phi Phi Malka is covering his ears right now, but <cf>if Mr. Kapakuk doesn't give up, his voice will surely be heard!
So please don't make light of <cf> your existence by calling it "like"!
...... unnecessary. However [--]
I'm sorry to say, but you are right. <cf>I'm not ready to realize it until someone else tells me.
If I don't believe in myself first, <cf>even Master Pipimarca won't believe my words!
...... Yes!
Ouch, kapakku!　Give me your hand!
<cf>Monsters are running amok in the Zero Zone of the Tree of Life!
What?　Okay, I'll be right there!
I'll help. The more help the better, right?
I'll help you. The more the merrier, right?
Yeah, let's be honest and ask for help here. <cf>Thank you for your help!
Ah, Kapakuk!
I've brought reinforcements. Where are the monsters? <cf>What's going on now?
The monsters are just up ahead. They're pretty tough opponents, man. <cf> Fortunately, no one lost their lives, but ......
Damn!　If the queen had taken action earlier, <cf>this wouldn't have happened: ......
That's not true!
Ka, kapakku?　What the hell, suddenly ......
The Queen is just lacking in confidence right now. <cf>Have you forgotten what you have been?
You have sacrificed yourself for the sake of <cf> our people, even in the hardest of times!
That's what ...... is for. <cf>But she is the queen, you know? <cf>You have to judge me properly at all times. ......
A queen is not a machine. <cf> She's one forest people with a heart.
Forest people must support each other in times of need.
That's ...... even if it's the queen. <cf>I believe that.
I will support my queen. <cf>This fight should be a sign of that determination!
Wait, Kapakuk!　You are not safe here alone!
Don't worry. We will go with you. <cf> You and your men should give priority to the wounded.
A subhuman and a human to help?
I wanted to help Ms. Kapaguk, who wishes to support the queen.
It doesn't matter if you are subhuman or human in your heart that you think so. ...... <cf>I believe so!
Let's go!　If you dawdle, <cf>Kapakuk may go in alone!
Support, or ......
Well, we've taken it down!
Oh, you beat that thing?　That's Kapaq! <cf>Even without the queen's instructions.
No, this is the queen's order. <cf>She said she'd leave it to us, didn't she?
Mu....... Indeed, that's what she said, but ......
The queen trusted our judgment. <cf>And I trusted her and moved on. That's it.
Kapakuk......
I support the Queen with my will. <cf>Not because someone told me to.
This victory is for Queen Pipimalka!
Oh my God!　There's a monster over there too ......!
Okay, I'll go [--].
No, I'll go. <cf> Kapakuk is the watchman, right?　You guys go back to your hometown.
...... I won't be dressed up just for you. <cf>We want to support the queen, too!
......
Let's go!　For our queen and our country!
Oh dear. Well, we will wait for the victory report at the Queen's mansion.
Everyone did a great job in defeating the enemy this time.
Thank you very much for your kind words.
I am truly ...... grateful for all the hard work you have done for us.
I know that it must be very difficult for someone like me to be the queen. ......
......Mr. Pipimalka, with all due respect, that's not true!
Kapakuku?　What ......
We fought the monsters because we wanted to protect <cf> this ulurau [township], and because we wanted to support Master Pipimalka.
We fought them because we wish to support you, Master Pipimalka, and to alleviate your sorrows.
I believe that you have a strong idea of what a queen should be.
<cf>We cannot deny that we have had such thoughts as well. <cf>But when we realized that even a queen is a member of the forest people,......
<cf> we were finally able to realize how much that thought had tormented Master Pipimalka!
We, too, only realized it when Kapakuk told us.
We had taken it for granted that we should serve the Queen, but <cf> that is not enough!
We protect the queen with our will. <cf>And we must become a people that the queen wants to protect.
From now on, we will support our queen!
Everyone ......
...... alone could not protect [the township (sato)]. <cf>So [--]
Will you <cf>all of you</cf> lend me your strength to protect this Ululau [township]?
Of course!
We will support the queen!
A new bond of the people of the forest, here!
Is it possible to say ...... that the case is closed?
Yes. I'm glad you're feeling better, Pipimaruka-sama.
You guys have helped me a lot. <cf> Now the people of the forest can start on a new path!
Everyone must feel <cf> closer to Master Pipimalka than before.
Hm?　What's wrong?
Nothing!　Nothing, it's just that it's good for us to be <cf>closer</cf> to everyone!　Hmm!
Oh, ......? <cf>Well, let's not get too wild on such an auspicious occasion.
Hmmm...yes, I suppose I should.
Hey, what's that smile? <cf>I'll give you your reward, so get the hell away from me!
Hey! I'm listening to you! <cf> I heard you had a fight with the dragon tribe at the forest people's place.
[--]!　How did you know that?
<cf>There's nothing this top of the line Jake-sama doesn't know!
Well, thanks in part to the connections your father left behind. <cf>My network is definitely bigger than before.
Mwah. ....... You are a surprisingly good shot, aren't you?
Well, yes. Thanks to you, I'm on the verge of opening <cf>Coin-tei No. 2</cf>!
Oh, I hate this talent that makes me the top no matter what I do.
Let's go, servant. <cf> I don't have time to listen to Jake's bragging.
Wait! <cf>There's a reward story that Feste's little girl likes to hear!
<cf>Tell me about it! <cf>We're on the same side. I'll listen.
You are indeed quick to change your tune when it comes to money. ...... <cf>Well, listen up!
<cf>The dragon tribe that showed up at the forest people's place, <cf>we've been getting reports of sightings of them here as well.
There hasn't been much damage, but <cf>my gut is telling me something fishy is going on.
It could be bad for business. If possible, I'd like to go to the place where the sighting was reported and check it out.
However, it is dangerous for me to go alone against the dragon tribe. That's why you want a skilled companion.
So that's what you're talking about. I understand.
If it involves the dragon tribe, we can't just leave it at that.
Then let's get started.
The location is "Mukai Jukai" in the Andorra Basin. <cf>I'll meet you at the entrance!
I've been waiting for you. <cf>For now, I'm going to check all the way to the back here.
If we meet a dragon tribe, I will leave it to you to decide whether or not to fight. <cf>Then, let's get our heads in the game and go!
I agree that we should brace ourselves, but <cf> do you have any more information about the enemy?
I'm sorry, but other than the fact that they seem to be dragons, I don't have any other information.
I can't go through the <cf>Pioneering Bureau</cf> because the information is too uncertain. Besides [--].
If we're dealing with someone like Leanblum, ......<cf>we're looking at an ordinary adventurer.
That's why you guys are here. <cf>I'm used to dragon people.
I'm sorry, but you're right. <cf>They're the right choice, considering the danger.
Isn't that right?　<cf>The safety of other adventurers <cf>is also a top of the line thing to consider!
You are strong, but in terms of being the real top, <cf>you still have to learn from me.
I'm sorry. I was careless with my praise. <cf>His self-esteem knows no bounds.
Servant. Leave Jake alone, <cf>we'll move on.
Well, watch my back on this investigation and <cf>learn</cf> what it is to be at the top[--]huh?　Don't leave me!
There was a dragon tribe, but it was a demi-dragon. <cf>There were a few others, it seems. ......
Why is there a demi-dragon here ......?
I wonder. Well,[--]
......[so...][i...][tsu...][tsu...][tsu...][tsu...][tsu...][tsu...][tsu...][tsu...]might know what's going on.
That guy?
That guy hiding behind the tree over there!
What the ......?　Damn it!
You can't let him go!
Get the fuck off me!　You son of a bitch!
You've been watching us fight the demi-dragons for <cf>ever</cf>!
You look familiar. ...... <cf>He's the one who used to cause problems at the pioneer station.
We all know how good you are, don't we?　How did you survive with all those demi-dragons <cf>wandering around?
Hmmm... ...... not so easy to get around.
Jake, let's take him back to the coin pavilion. <cf>This is not a good place to continue interrogating him.
I agree. <cf>We never know when the demi-dragons will come out again.
Come on, get up! <cf>I'm inviting you to my pride and joy, the Coin Pavilion!
Damn, who talks!　Fuck you all!
The adventurer we caught in the Sea of Mists, <cf>when I offered him some money, he readily agreed to talk.
...... He was a collaborator hired by the dragon tribe, it seems!
A collaborator?　What on earth for?
He was working with the demi-dragons on a plan to raid the merchant fleets coming and going in and around Asterlys.
Hiring ...... people, making plans, <cf>that kind of intelligence is not in the hands of a demi-dragon.
Oh. Of course there is a dragon tribe behind all this. <cf>His name is [--].
[--] Leanbrum.
The money and goods he took from the merchants were contracted to be divided fifty-fifty.
Leanbrum. I thought you had disappeared from the Duchy of Barnhart, but here you are, in the dark.
You were right to ask for my help. <cf> We could have fought with Leenblum.
Ha. ....... <cf> For once, I admire your instincts.
<cf> I admire your intuition for once, don't I?　<cf>As a top adventurer, my instincts are always good!
You can praise me more, can't you? Come on, <cf> don't be shy. Praise is welcome!　Come on!
Damn!　I find that kind of <cf>face forwardness from you annoying!
Feste, your tone is shifting.
Yes!
Noooooooooo!　Humiliation!　Humiliation!
Hmmm, the raid on the merchants was stopped by those guys?
Too bad. I would have loved to see the <cf>skeptical Asterlys teaming up with the humans and the demi-dragons.
We don't know who is communicating with us ....... <cf>A little prodding at the point where such fears have risen to their zenith [--].
<cf>A city full of adventurers would have gone by in a blink of an eye.
I am afraid to say this. <cf>Master Leanbrum. <cf>Master Avuninthe has ordered us to join him. ......
I am not his man. I only cooperated with Barnhardt because <cf> our interests were aligned.
And yet ...... hahaha!　Orders are laughable!
I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to do with this, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.
...... how do you reply?
No need. Let it go.
I'm just me and I'll do as I please....... kuku......<cf> haha, hahahahaha!
......Yeah, thanks for letting me know. <cf>I'll let you know if I need anything else.
What's up, Charlotte?　What's wrong? <cf>You look serious. ......
Oh, ......, I heard something that's been bothering me.
Recently, there have been a lot of attacks by <cf>monsters</cf> around Salamzat.
It seems that even here at the settlement office, there have been requests for <cf>reinforcement</cf>. ......
Speaking of Salamzat,<cf>...... I see. <cf>Your troupe is still stuck there?
Maybe because of the monsters, <cf>they can't get out of there for a while.
I wish I could be [by your side] at a time like this. ......
Why don't you come with me to Salaamzad to see what's going on?
I'd like to go with you to Salaamzad to see what's going on.
What? ......?
I'm a star diva, but Lalaforte and Myrrhene are there too, so it wouldn't hurt to get away from the temple for a little while, would it?
Sure, I'm not as busy making offerings[--]chronograms to the gods<cf>as I used to be,......
...... I hope it's okay if I go see him.
The armed group thing has calmed down. <cf>No one will complain if you go to see the troupe.
I see. <cf>I guess it's safe to go see them now.
Well then, I'll indulge you guys. <cf>Please escort me to Salamzaat!
Oh, you're in charge! <cf>Well, I'll get paid properly, though, won't I?
<cf>Well, you'll get your reward, though, won't you? <cf>I'll take care of the reward. I'm getting some money from the Order.
Haa...... I'm getting nervous <cf> at the thought of seeing you all again after all these years. I hope you are well. ......
Commander!　Everyone!
[--]!　Char!
It's Charlotte!
Oh, it's Charlotte!　It really is Charlotte!
I'm home!　How are you guys?
Yeah, we're fine! <cf> You're the one who ...... ugh, Char ...... be splendid!
You were the diva at the Star Festival. <cf>Congratulations, you did great!
Heh heh, I pitched it to the wrong people and <cf>was hired successfully!
With your singing voice, you deserved it. Be proud of yourself.
Everyone in the troupe is very proud of you. <cf>After all, one of our own has become a star diva!
Thanks for the ......
By the way, what's up with this star diva today?
Maybe she's back in the troupe!
Oh, uh, ...... no, no. I've solved the problem, but <cf> I still have work to do as a star-spirit diva!
Today, I heard that there was a <cf> string of monster attacks around Salamzat, so everyone got worried.
Then these guys said<cf>they would escort us. So I came to check on you.
Oh!　You guys are taking care of Char now <cf>!
You've met the right people, Char.
Yeah, I'm glad!　So, to the point, ......<cf>What's the monster attack like?
Apparently they've built a nest near the street. <cf>They attack anything that comes near them indiscriminately.
This has caused a trade stalemate and a shortage of supplies, and we can't get out of the oasis very often.
Even if we were to ask adventurers to escort us, <cf>we would need more people in a large group like ours</cf>.
I heard that a strike force has been organized through the Pioneer Bureau. ......
Yes,<cf>that's ....... <cf>I think it would be quicker to look.
They're gathering at the settlement office.
I'd love to hear what your escort has to say about it.
I don't know what's going on, but <cf>we should go to the settlement office here anyway, right?
Yes. Then we can figure out why we can't <cf>get the monsters down forever</cf>. ......
But I disagreed with you! <cf>I was right, wasn't I?
But if you hadn't backed down there, <cf>there would have been more injuries!
Hey~ what should we do with this equipment?
As far as I'm concerned, the current strategy is too appropriate!
Oh, oh ...... this is brilliant ......
It's so disjointed. ...... <cf> I wonder if there's a leader.
Oh my, did you guys see the call for a strike team too? <cf>I'm sorry, but we have our hands full with administration right now: ......
No, I'm still considering whether or not to volunteer. ......<cf>Which one of you is the leader of this strike team?
Well, the adventurer who was supposed to be the leader left <cf>early</cf> due to injury.
We tried to decide on a replacement, but everyone wanted to <cf>be the leader themselves</cf> and here we are. ......
<cf>I'm not talking about defeating monsters here. <cf>Someone has to take the lead, even if it's by force.
Unless you are an outstandingly skilled person, <cf>the people here are all very good at what they do. ......
I see.　<cf>I see. So it's good if you're outstandingly good. <cf>Then we have just the person for you.
Well, before we do that, we should turn our attention to ......
Charlotte?　What are you--
Hey, everybody!　It's a special performance by the beautiful diva Charlotte! <cf> Now I'm going to make you my prisoner!
[~~~] ♪
Oh?　What's that?
You have a beautiful voice. ......
Cute!
Thanks for listening to me sing! <cf>There is someone I want to introduce to you all today!
What's that?
This adventurer is <cf>the liver of Jake, the <cf>top of the top adventurers in Asterlys!
Oh~~!
He's also a great adventurer who has a good relationship with the Duchy of Barnhart, and has even fought against the dragon tribe!
Oh~~~!
Come to think of it, I heard about him a while ago. <cf>I heard there was an amazing newcomer to Asterlys.
He's been improving his achievements at a tremendous rate. ......<cf>That was him, wasn't it?
I also heard that he beat Avaritia!
<cf>I'm so glad to hear he's such a great guy! <cf>We'd love to have you as the leader of the defeat team!
Eh, yeah?
Please. I'm asked to do one thing here. <cf>You're good enough.
<cf> Charlotte's strategy won out. <cf>I've come this far, I have no choice but to accept.
<cf>Thank you!　<cf>I'm sorry. <cf>I'll be sure to follow up!
Now, please take down the monsters as soon as possible! <cf>The monster's nest is in the "Stage of the [wind spirit]"!
OK, then, let's all go. <cf>Enjoy my song along the way!
Wooooooooooooo!
Looks like there's a monster's nest in the back here.
The visibility is poor due to the sand. ...... If we're not careful, we might get into a fight with each other. <cf> Going in with a large group is dangerous.
Let's divide them into groups based on compatibility. <cf>Then we can try to time our raids.
Let's see, ...... that guy was good at close range. <cf>So let's pair him with this one, and the other one with ......
<cf>You've already figured out their characteristics in the short time you've been here?
Yes, I have. We chatted along the way. <cf>Songs are a good way to bring us closer together.
Haha ....... <cf>I didn't think much of you when you were mentioned as a future leader, but now that I see it, I see what you mean.
I still don't believe you on that one. <cf>These tricks are just like what the leaders do.
But if it is in my <cf>flesh and blood in the future, then ......
I wonder if I will still feel <cf>close to the Commander and the others when I go to the <cf>future</cf>!
Charlotte......
No no no! <cf>I need to focus on exterminating the monster nest now!
Guys..!　I'm going to explain the policy now, so listen carefully. <cf>First, we're going to break into groups [--].
......I'm sure he's got a lot on his mind.
......All right, everyone's ready? <cf>So, let's go with the plan!
Thanks for the help! <cf>There should be no more attacks on Salamzat now!
Goodness, I thought I was just coming to see how things were going, but <cf>I didn't realize we were going to have to take down a monster!
I'll give you a special reward for that, will you forgive me?
Oh, everyone!　Thanks for your hard work, everyone! <cf>I'd love it if you could come to the central square later.
Because my troupe is going to give an incredible performance. <cf>We'll launch there!
<cf>Well, before I knew it, he had taken the initiative. <cf>You've been set up, haven't you?
Come on, let's go back to Salamzaat. <cf>We have to tell the troupe it's all right now.
I'm home. <cf>We've successfully defeated the monsters!
Oh, really?　That's great, Char!
They are the ones who are awesome. <cf> I was just following up.
Ah, yes, Commander. Can I give a performance to commemorate the defeat? <cf>I've promised everyone in the defeat squad.
No problem!　<cf>Because of the attack, it wasn't the right time to put on a performance, but now we won't be afraid anymore.
Let's give a triumphant performance to commemorate the defeat of the monster!
Yay!　It's been a while since I've seen you all on stage!
Of course you're going to be there, aren't you?　Charles.
...... Yeah. <cf>Please do!
...... Char, you.
You, you see, ......
Uh, yeah. Yo, yo!　The Gilwet Traveling Troupe, <cf>we're about to start our first full-member performance in a while!
Hey, guys!　Have a lot of fun today!
Ooh-ohh!　Charlotte!
Charlotte, you're so cute!
I'm captivated!
This is the hottest stage ever, isn't it? <cf>As if, this is the last ......
...... Oh, yeah!
I'm still going! <cf>Me, all of you, I'll make you my captive!
That was awesome, Char. <cf> Maybe it's because you've been a star-spirit diva, but you've become even better at it again.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
<cf> You're a ......, hey, Char. <cf>You ......
You ......
......Yes, I know. I know.
Char. Whenever and wherever you are, <cf>you are our troupe, you are our daughter.
Our hearts are always with you. <cf> Don't ever forget that.
Commander ......
I know you'll be fine wherever you go, <cf>but take care of yourself.
...... yeah, yeah. <cf>Thanks ......
Now go. We <cf>hope</cf> you get to meet your real parents someday!
......Yes. I'm off!
...... Are you ready to go?　Charlotte.
Yes, I am. I've received the Commander and the others' feelings very well.
Let's go back to Asterlys. <cf> We need to finish the chronogram.
Someday we'll go, for the future: ......
(surprise - action scene)
You are ......
(Action Scene)
Hope ......
Wake up ......
All to you ......
Please, let this world ......
The stars, the future......
Wake up, wake up......!
(Confused) ......!
(Running away) Ha...... ha...... ha...... ha...... ha......
You persist!　Give up for good!
(Surprise) Ah!
What?
Get down!
(Down! ) Ugh!
I didn't think there were others. ......
You're unlucky, too. Well, meeting you here is just a chance of fate.
Even I can't dream of leaving you to die.
I'll buy you some time. When I give you the signal, <cf>run past him at once. Okay?
...... you?
...... What about you?
Never mind. I'll just make a run for it.
(Surprise) Oh, ......
You, what [--]
To kill a man is to dream a dream, right?
It's a bad dream to kill a man, right?
...... is amazing!
I thought you were a bit fuzzy, but <cf> you're a good user!
You are a sight to behold!
Hmm?　What's the matter?
Pull yourself together!　Hey!　Hey!
You are ......
...... the future. ......
Good morning. How are you feeling?
Do you know me?
Good ......
Well then, I'll see you soon. <cf>I'm Feste!　Nice to meet you!
Remember when you collapsed in the ruins, big brother? <cf>It was hard to carry you!
<cf> Remember when you collapsed at the ruins, big sis? <cf>It was so hard to carry you!
Those ruins were only recently discovered, <cf>and few others must have known about them. ......
How did you end up in that place?
Huh?　What do you mean? Did you hit your head or something when you fell? <cf> But I wasn't seriously hurt. ......
Ah, yes, a name!　What's your name?
......[player name]
Other than that?
I can't remember......
Oh yeah...... you too......
......I don't have any memories and I'm alone, I'll miss you!
Actually, Feste can't remember much of the past either. <cf>So, friends, right?
Yes, that's right!　Feste, I'll help you <cf>get your brother's memory back!
That's right!　Feste, I'll help you <cf>get your sister's memory back!
You saved me at the ruins, didn't you? <cf>So, now let Feste help you?
Alright. Once you've decided that, you have to act!
If you're feeling okay, let's <cf>go back to those ruins one more time. Maybe there are some clues there!
Okay!　...... Oh, that's right. <cf>Could you sign this guestbook before you go?

Hahahahahahaha, yessssss!
A guest book is a temporary form, this is a servant contract with me!
With this, you are my servant from this day forward! <cf> You will work hard and reduce my debt!
What ......?
<cf>You've got a good arm, you know. <cf>I thought it would be a shame to let you go.
Now, let me introduce myself once again. <cf>I am Feste, or as some call me, the eternal beauty.
<cf> Don't worry, I'm here to help you find clues to your memories. I'm here to <cf>help you find clues to your memories. And while we're at it, right?
Go on then, my servant! <cf>There are treasures waiting for you that you have not yet seen!
...... and, well, I'll see you soon, ehehe*.
Well, first of all, let's say hello to the innkeeper.
<cf>He brought you here from the ruins. <cf> You should at least thank him.
He's sitting at the counter on the first floor.
Oh, you're awake at last. <cf>How do you like it?　Wasn't my bed comfortable?
I'm the owner of this restaurant, the Two-faced Coin Shop. <cf>Thanks for all you've done for me.
I really am. I've lost track of how much you're paying me.
Ho-ho-ho, just forget about it.
You're up one more digit this time.
Damn, you're a miser.
Which one is it? What kind of idiot is so blinded by money that he'd go to those ruins alone?
Which good-natured husband was worried about such an idiot and came all the way to check on him~?
(Right on target) -- ......
<cf>If he dies, he'll be a lucky man! <cf> If he dies, he won't pay the bill!
You're not being honest. You should have just told me that you're melting with the charm of this Feste-chan.
(Stupefied.) Huh. ......
Well, don't worry!　From now on, <cf>this servant will be earning money for me.
(I'm surprised that you'd do such a thing on your own.) Eh~?
You've been spotted by a tough guy too. ...... <cf> This guy is older than he looks, and he's old!
<cf>What are you talking about, husband? <cf>Feste, I don't understand*.
（<cf>Ha~!
Are you going somewhere now?
Ah. <cf> His memory seems to be a little suspect, so I'm going to look for clues.
I see. ...... Be careful. <cf>It's dangerous outside the city.
If your memory is hazy, be more careful. <cf>Listen to your surroundings and don't be unprepared!
Asterlys is the largest commercial city in the neighborhood. There is nothing here that you can't get your hands on.
<cf>Any store that catches your eye is a good place to start.
<cf>There's also a "Pioneer Bureau" <cf>where adventurers can take requests.
Anyway, it's a big town. <cf>Take your time and get used to it.
<cf>Outside that gate is a world of monsters. <cf>Be aware that once you cross over, a battle awaits you.
<cf>Now, before we go outside the city, we must make one preparation.
First, let's head to the "Gate Plaza. <cf>The gate you saw earlier.
There is no need to hurry. <cf>After you have had a look around the town, it's fine.
This is the Gaimon plaza.
Now, before we leave, let me tell you something.
The device in front of us [--]<cf>is called a "transfer portal.
It is an excellent device that allows you to instantly return to wherever you are!
Let's put it to use right away.
It's easy. <cf> Just touch it gently.
There are portals like this all over the world. <cf>Make sure to use them when you find them!
Then, once you have touched them, you are off on your adventure!
This is the Asteria Plain. <cf>This is the richest grassland area on the southern edge of the Magna Continent.
Various useful things can be found here, and the ruins of <cf>Bafaria</cf> lie here and there.
You may even find clues to your lost memories.
<cf>The ruins where I met you are over there. <cf>You should go there first.
They have only recently been discovered and are still clean.
But since you were at ...... such a place, <cf>you must have been well-informed, right?
You don't have to remind me of that now. <cf>Anyway, let's go!
Damn!　I've been oblivious!
Go, my servant. Kick them to the curb!
Ho-ho-ho. I was not blind. <cf>You are very good at what you do!
Now, the place where you fell was back here, wasn't it? <cf>Let's go check it out!
Around here. ......
Hmm?　<cf> Something has fallen there. ......
It's an Imagine Seed.
What, you forgot about the Imagine Seed? <cf>This is some nasty amnesia. ......
May I? <cf> An Imagine Seed is a crystal of will.
<cf>It is a materialized form of the "engram" that all things living on this planet possess.
That is the Imagine Seed. Is that clear so far?
The Imagine Seed can draw various powers by pouring its owner's engrams into it.
Well, it's good to have, isn't it? <cf>Now, is there anything else that might give us a clue?
Well, ...... we have no choice. Let's head back to Asterlys for a while. <cf>We can't stay long in a dangerous place.
<cf>Wow! I never thought I'd meet you at a newly discovered site. <cf>Snouty as ever, little subhuman?
That's Jake. <cf>The self-proclaimed top adventurer of Asterlys.
<cf> I am flattered by your praise. Though "self-proclaimed" is a bit excessive.
Unfortunately, we have already conquered these ruins. <cf>Latecomers, go home.
What did you say?　What about the monsters inside?
Well, in my hands, it will be gone in an instant.
It must have been nasty in the preliminary survey. ......<cf>You killed it?　All by yourself?
Good! That's great!　I haven't seen you around here before, <cf>Are you new to Asterlys?　Have you registered as an adventurer?
I haven't yet, but you can sign up at ....... <cf>What's the matter, you'll talk to me?
Yes, we're always happy to have talented people on board!
Hey, rookie. <cf>If you are willing to register as an adventurer and take requests [--].
I suggest you come to Master Jake here for help. <cf>We're always welcome!
<cf>I'll be at the pioneer station. <cf>I'll be at the Pioneer Station, so if you feel like it, come visit me. See ya.
Well, you're still the same old wisecracking bastard, aren't you?
Well, if he's here, I'm sure you'll be able to register as an adventurer without any trouble.
He's a bit of a pain in the ass, but he's sort of the coordinator for all the adventurers in Asterlys.
Perhaps we are lucky to have met him here. <cf>You've got a lot of 'stuff', don't you?
May I?　You may be concerned about your own memory, but <cf>first you must have the means to live.
What do you need for that?
In short, ......
With your skills, you should be able to earn a living as an adventurer. <cf>To do so, you must register with the Pioneer Bureau.
Besides, information is gathered there. <cf>You may eventually come across something that connects to your memories.
<cf>Once that is decided, we must act! <cf>We'll go to the pioneering station to see Jake as soon as possible.
Oh, yes! <cf>This is the time to use spatial transport to get back to the city!
See, we can use the transporter portal <cf>when we leave town, right?
It's convenient to get back quickly. <cf> You'd better get used to it before too long!
This is the "Pioneer Station". <cf>This is an organization that supports adventurers from all over the world.
[<cf>Well, in short, it's like a job referral agency.
If you become an adventurer, <cf>you too can earn money here!
Hey! Welcome, rookie. Welcome, rookie.
To become an official adventurer here in Asterlys, you must <cf>take the test and register with the Pioneer Bureau.
Right now, you are in a "provisional registration" status, with me as your nominator.
From now on, you will be asked to take a registration test. <cf>Think of it as a test of your ability.
If you successfully complete the request, you will be "registered" <cf>.
For more details, please ask the hot and cute guide lady. <cf>Muiry, come on!
You must be the newcomer. <cf>I'm MURIE, the general information clerk. Nice to meet you.
Well, first of all, let me <cf>explain</cf> about this pioneer station.
<cf>We receive a variety of requests from all over the world. <cf>Everything from exterminating monsters to finding things, you know.
<cf>After receiving and accomplishing a request, a reward will be given to you. <cf>The more difficult the request, the better the reward!
That's all for the basic explanation. <cf>So let's get started with the registration exam!
<cf>You don't have to be so rigid. <cf>We'll make sure you get a request that is commensurate with your abilities.
Oh?　Isn't that an Imagine Seed you're holding?
We picked it up at the Cliff Ruins. ......<cf> We're not very familiar with it.
Can you show us?
This is ......
It's a goblin battle-imagine.
Damn, goblins. ......
Oh, ......? <cf> This is ready to go right off the bat.
You're lucky to have picked it up in this condition. <cf>Maybe you can put it to good use.
Now let's start the registration exam. <cf>When you're ready, talk to me.
If you become an adventurer, I should be able to offer you <cf>some good paying jobs!
Well, I can offer you a good rate! <cf>You have a few words to say, don't you?
Of course! For that, you'll have to pass the exam <cf>easily!
I'm looking forward to adventures with you too. <cf>Good Luck! Do your best!
You're going to take the registration exam?
Good. <cf>Well, Jake was the one who recommended me. ......
He already has a track record of defeating goblins ...... and. <cf>Then I guess that's enough of a test to see if I'm any good.
Now, let me explain the test.
You are now going to <cf>go to the dungeon to investigate.
<cf>There is a place called <cf>The Lake Lid Tunnel</cf> in the Asteria Plains, in the Sea Rhythm Meadow.
<cf>"Lake Lid Tunnel"? <cf>It's an old mine, isn't it?　I hear the name from time to time.
<cf> Well, to be precise, it's the remains of an old mine. <cf>To explore it and reach the deepest part.
Actually, after it was closed down, it became inhabited by monsters. <cf>The danger isn't that great, though.
The Pioneer Bureau is monitoring it, and I thought it would be just fine <cf>to use it to test the newcomers' skills.
Oops. You've got some pretty wild ideas, don't you?
Hmmm. <cf>As an adventurer, you should be able to overcome a difficulty like this on your own.
So, the exploration of the Lake Tunnel will be the test for registration as an adventurer.
Jake has given you his blessing, and I have high hopes for you. <cf>Good luck!
<cf>There's a place over there where engrams are spewing out of the ground. That's the marker.
It's called a "star vein hole. It leads to ruins and caves. <cf>When you find it, remember where it is.
<cf>The Lake Tunnel is connected to this star vein hole.
Well then, let's go in. Mewry said it wasn't that <cf>dangerous</cf>, but ......
<cf>This is a place to see how good a newcomer can be. <cf>We have to anticipate a problem or two.
<cf>Are you ready? <cf>I'm not worried about you, but you can never be too careful!
Well, down here, ......<cf>you may have some tough opponents, but[--]
<cf>Don't be afraid, for together we will make a name for ourselves. <cf>Let us make a name for ourselves together!
Is that an ...... ogre?　<cf>I never heard of an ogre!
...... I was surprised. <cf>That was an ogre,......
<cf>I didn't know there was going to be an ogre! <cf>I thought it was a mook at most......
Even if it was part of the test, <cf>that's too tough for a fledgling!
Well, you beat him, though. <cf>So my servant!　I commend you!
This should be the end of the test. <cf>Now, let us report to Muley with dignity!
Welcome home. We've been waiting for you.
From the looks of it, ...... Hmmm, looks like it went well. <cf>How did you like the Lake Tunnel?
That's the thing. <cf>Are you sure it wasn't too difficult, even for a test?
I didn't hear anything about an ogre! <cf> I think it's too tough for a novice.
An ogre?　What are you talking about? <cf> I didn't get that report.
Well, wasn't it part of the test?
Of course it was. You wouldn't <cf>include a dangerous monster like an ogre in an exam assignment.
...... hmm?　Oh, wait a minute. <cf>Did you kill the ogre by any chance?
Oh, that was indeed a difficult one. <cf>Hey, my servant!
Eh?　Really! <cf>Even adventurers can have trouble with these monsters!
Anyway, there's an ogre in the Lake Tunnel, isn't there? <cf>I'll call upper management right away, just wait a minute!
Fuu....... Thank you for your patience. <cf>At any rate, I've sent out a survey team to the "Lake Lydd Tunnel.
By the way,...... you're amazing, aren't you? <cf>How could you defeat an ogre out of the blue?
Everyone was surprised. <cf>Maybe someone amazing will join us!　<cf>...<cf>....
Eh, huh?　Isn't that right?　You think so? <cf> Well, I was the one who spotted him first!
So, how is the exam going?
Of course, congratulations! <cf>You have passed the Adventurer Registration Examination!
The Pioneer Bureau welcomes newcomers. <cf>We're so glad and dependable that you've joined us!
Now you are an adventurer in good standing. <cf>From now on, you can accept requests from the Pioneer Bureau.
You did it!　You're a servant! <cf>Go ahead and make a lot of money!
Earning money is good, but don't forget to raise your Adventurer Rank!
Adventurer Rank?
It's a measure of your skill as an adventurer, how strong you are, and how much danger you can <cf>overcome</cf>. It's an overall measure of your skill as an adventurer, your strength, how many dangers you can overcome, and so on.
If you complete a specific Adventure Board, <cf>you can apply for rank advancement at my office.
Hmmm...at ......?　What's in it for me <cf> if I move up in rank?
Absolutely!　For example, you can <cf>accept more rewarding requests, or
For example, you can receive requests with higher rewards, facilities linked to the Pioneer Bureau are released, and there are places you can only go <cf>at a certain rank.
Oh?　That's something to look forward to.
Right?　Well then, I <cf>will give you the first adventure board.
If you have any questions, <cf>just let me know.
Oh, yeah! <cf>And there was a special bonus for you!
Noooooo!　A special bonus*? <cf> Don't listen to it!　That's not a good idea!
<cf>You killed the ogre in the Lake Tunnel, didn't you?
As a reward for providing important information and defeating the ogre, the Pioneer Bureau would like to present you with this!
This is a glory coin. It's a "GC". <cf>You can exchange them for various things at the Souvenir Exchange.
Not only useful items for adventures,<cf>but also unique outfits are available!
<cf>Grooming is one of the most important aspects of being an adventurer, so please make the most of your "GC"!
The souvenir exchange counter is to the right as you face me. <cf>That's right there, so be sure to take a peek!
Costumes. You don't see many of them in regular stores, <cf>so it might be a good idea to get them here.
Thanks for all your help. <cf>Thank you, Mullie.
You're welcome. <cf>Well then, we look forward to your continued support of the <cf>Pioneering Bureau!
<cf>Are you finally an adventurer now?
<cf>And now, as promised. <cf>I'll show you some good paying jobs.
Oh, I've been waiting for you! <cf>Something like that!
Oops, looks like you're still at rank '1'. <cf>I'll let you know if you don't get a "2" or higher.
We're going to a bit of a tricky place. <cf>I'm making it a condition that you have to be Adventure Rank '2' or higher.
If you complete the adventure board that you get when you pass the exam, you can get to rank up to "2".
Unnunu...... are you being impatient!
Sorry! <cf>I know you're good, but that's not the same thing.
When the Adventure Board squares are filled, <cf>you can go and report back to Mury.
She'll show you the steps to move up in rank. <cf>In some cases, there's a Battle there, too.
Alright!　This is not how it's going to be, servant. <cf>Get on with it and get that adventure board out of the way!
<cf>Let's get down to the nitty-gritty of this "good-paying job.
Actually, <cf>a rather nasty fellow has appeared in the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" northeast of here!
I'm going to take him down with me. ......
Wait a minute. <cf> Didn't you just say "Claw marks of the giant dragon"?
You don't think it's related to the dragon tribe, do you?
I heard that they are attacking the holy places of the Buffalian religion in various parts of the country<cf> without regard.
I don't want to deal with such ferocious people!
How can you ask a rookie to take on such a dangerous request?
The target is not a dragon tribe. <cf>According to eyewitness accounts, the target is a boar-like beast.
Hmmm ......
Rookies are always in need of something, right? <cf> Especially if that little lady is around.
You really are a meddler, aren't you? <cf>If only MURI could see through your caring nature: ......
What? <cf> Or did she say something about me?
Well, there's no harm in taking it. <cf>Seriously, I'd appreciate a good reward.
OK, we have a deal. <cf> I'll see you there, buddy.
By the way, what did she say about me?
We'll meet there. <cf> Alright, let's get ready and go!
<span size="Big">Oh, hey, ......wait!
Please! <cf>You're with me from here on out.
I'll show you. <cf>I'll show you what top of the line fighting is all about!
<cf>Steal all the skills you can, my servant. <cf>Steal for free!
I can hear you!
Oh, well. If it makes you a better adventurer, <cf>I'll make a way for you.
That's a very encouraging thing to say. <cf>If you have any advice for the younger guys, I'm all ears.
Yes, ....... The Clawmarks of the Giant Dragon is <cf>one of the largest Buffalian ruins around.
It's probably higher level than the "Lake Tunnel". <cf>The monsters inside are powerful and numerous.
It is important to check your skills.
Hmmm, skills.
The difficulty level depends on how you handle your skills. <cf>It is not only about you, but also about the safety of your companions.
If you can't make the best moves when the time comes, you'll lose your reputation as an adventurer.
Skills, Imagines, Items. <cf> Let's make sure we are fully prepared before we take on a challenge.
<cf>That's more sound advice than I expected. <cf> Well, that's why you're the man you are, Jake.
<cf>Well, that's what Jake is all about, isn't it? <cf> Keep your skills in check, my servant.
<cf>Okay, then, let's go. <cf>Your target is just down the hall, let's go!
Let's go!
(surprise) ......!
This guy ......, no way!
[No, don't worry about it! <cf>Now concentrate on defeating him!
You're awesome!　You're just what I expected of you!
But ...... sorry. You're stronger than the information I gave you. <cf> This is my fault for not casing the place.
What's the matter, girl?　You don't look so good, do you?
......I didn't think so,......
...... This is "Avaritia"!
Hahaha, that's a harsh joke. <cf>Abaritia is the monster from [adventure story], right?
That's the one, right?　<cf> It's said that it has transcended time and space and continues to live, <cf> while bearing the sin of disobeying God. ......
With that strength. It must be Abaritia.
...... You've beaten him, haven't you? <cf>Who the hell are you?
<cf>This means I won't have much to teach you anytime soon. <cf>Truly, I'm glad to see you're such a reliable junior!
Anyway, I'm going home first.
If he's the only avaricious one, that's fine, but if others appear, I'll have to warn the town.
See you later!　Come back to the settlement office later. <cf>I'll pay you exactly what you owe me!
What was that about ......?
Hmm?　What's going on?
(Notice & Surprise) Oh, ......
<cf>What the hell are you doing? <cf> What the hell are you?　Didn't you just fly out of the sky?
Are you a ......[visitor]?
A visitor?　What is that?
This "shimmering" is ...... of [Raija]. <cf> No, but ......
Do you know anything about it?
Do you know anything about it?
......Yes, for that ......Yes,......
It's too early to make a ...... decision, huh?
Hey, holy shit!　Who are you? <cf>You've been muttering incomprehensible things for a while now!
......Yes, that's right. I'll at least tell you my name. <cf>We may be friends for a long time to come!
My name is Merlouf. I'm just a wanderer.
Well...
But he's a strange one, isn't he? May I? <cf> If you get tangled up with people like that, just ignore them.
<cf> If you allow yourself to be taken advantage of just because they are a little nice to you, they are bound to take advantage of you. <cf> They will take advantage of you.
Why are you staring at me?
Anyway, he said something about ......[visitor], didn't he?
I've heard of this ......[raija]......[/cf>[raija]....... <cf>......Ah, no, I can't remember!
Anyway, there it is. <cf>I've got to get Jake's reward before I forget!　Let's go!
Yo, good job! <cf>This is the reward. Take it.
By the way, I got some information from ...... that's a bit disturbing. <cf>I'll pass it on to you guys.
<cf>I've been re-confirming the sightings of unidentified creatures that have been circulating in various areas of the country recently.
There's quite a bit of information on ...... that <cf>may<cf> be avaritia.
Hou......
Oh, and one more thing.
The time of the spike in sightings coincides with <cf>when the dragon tribe began their rampage.
Hmmm ....... <cf> It's a bit tricky to dismiss it as a coincidence.
<cf> I also hear that the dragon tribe was <cf> terribly well organized, unlike before.
I don't like to imagine that. ......
......Someone got to the top. <cf>It also has the power to unite [my] strong dragon clans......
Well, this doesn't prove that the dragon clans and avaritia are <cf>related[--].
I'll keep digging.
You guys let me know if you get any info.
Oh, yeah. You should probably get a new weapon in case you run into them, right?
Oh, by the way, I have to ask you, <cf> have you ever heard of the word "raija"?
No?　Never heard of it?
Muuu...... I see... ......
But that's the thing, you see. About Mewry, <cf>...... what did he say about me, you see?
Oh, yeah. <cf>["]Jake's hot gaze is ......["]"]
The gaze is ......!
With this reward, there's only so much I can teach you. <cf>That's it then.
Wait, wait, oi!
Ho-ho-ho. A woman's secrets are expensive. <cf> And at market value.
I'm going to go to ......!
...... Oh, yes. You should go to the Coin Pavilion. <cf>The owner said he'd buy you a drink to celebrate the accomplishment of your request.
What?　Don't say that kind of thing too soon! <cf>Okay, let's go to the coin-operated pavilion, servant!
Oh, what's the matter?
<span size="Big">I came here because I heard you were buying me a drink! </>
What are you talking about?
I heard you were coming to <span size="Big">pay the bill</span>.
I heard you're going to <cf>put all this money towards paying the bill</cf>. Oh, that's great!
Who are you?　Who told you that bullshit?
Jake. I'll pay you well, <cf>so they say, feel free to rip me off!
Damn ......!　That son of a bitch set me up!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Give up, for God's sake. <cf> Or I won't let you use this place anymore.
...... Oh, that's right. <cf>But first, have you ever heard of the word "raija"?
No?　[Raija?
It seems to be a clue to your servant's memory.
Oh, a clue. ...... <cf>[Raija]...... or ......
Wasn't that something from the Buffalian religion?
Buffalianism......
Fortunately, there is a large temple of the Buffalian religion in this city. <cf> If you're curious, go there.
But still, there's a lot of [raija] in Avaritia,......<cf> strangely enough, a lot of things related to the Buffalian religion,......
...... haha!　<cf>Hey, hey! <cf>Pay the bill and go[-]!
Um, are you a priest? <cf>I'd like to ask you a few questions:......
Oh, it's unusual for a subhuman young lady to come to the temple. <cf>Are you interested in the Buffalian religion?
<cf>Buffalism is open to a wide range of sub-humans, you know. <cf>If you are interested in hearing what we have to say, you are more than welcome.
<cf>Thank you very much! <cf>Do you know the meaning of the word "[raija]", Priestess?
[raija]...... Ah, this is a very old word again!
Do you know it?
I know it. <cf> But I am a little hesitant to answer.
What?　Why, <span size="Big">cheap! </>
Keg, I've been called a cheapskate: ......
[Raija] is a particularly difficult word in the doctrine. <cf> It is not something that should be uttered unspoken.
That is exactly the kind of ...... that is not immune to controversy, depending on interpretation. <cf> All I can say is this.
Sorry, subhuman lady. <cf>I have some business to attend to, so here goes:......
Mwah. ......
Oh dear. What is it about the word <cf>that you don't want to be mentioned much in the cult?
But it bothers me. ......
Hmm?　What's up, girl? What do you want from us?
...... you are, are you?
Yeah?　You know her?
Hmmm... ...... Well, okay. You must be a <cf> cult member by the looks of your clothes.　[Do you know anything about the Visitors?
Minsterhorn ......
If you go to Minsterhorn, <cr>maybe you can find out. ......
The Minsterhorn. But could there be such a <cf>clue there......?
Well, let's give it a try. Shall we go there?
Tell me [--].
(Surprise!) ah...... ugh!
What a mysterious girl you are. ......
Hello!　Does anyone around here know <cf> more about [raija]?
[Raija?　That's my teacher's specialty, but <cf>I'm kind of out of town right now. ......
You guys are adventurers, right?
That's good to know. My name is Myrlene,<cf> and I was wondering if you could help me with a job.
I need you to <cf>find</cf> that very teacher for me. ......
Okay, I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.
Okay, I'll take it. I'll take it.
Thank you!　That's very helpful!
We have some questions we want to ask you too, so don't worry about it. <cf>By the way, who's the teacher?
He's a priest of the Order of Buffalia, a priest of the Order and a historian who studies the <cf> history of the Buffalians.
He is a priest of the Order and a historian who studies the history of the Buffalians.
Well, his research went too far, and he was sent to this place.
Let's leave that aside for now. Like me, he is <cf>very interested in history.
This time, too, he said, "["]I'm going to do field research! [I said, "["]" and flew from here to the ruins of <cf>the Giant Tower</cf>.]
They didn't come back until after the scheduled date. <cf>So I was going to submit a request to the Pioneer Bureau now.
Dr. Wahlkin is all about research, <cf>and he's not exactly a flattering exercise guy.
I was worried that <cf>we might get attacked by a monster while we were preoccupied with our research. ......
I understand. You can wait and see. <cf>This super beautiful girl, Feste-chan, will find it for you!
Thank you, Feste-chan!　<cf>Thank you, Feste-chan, a super beautiful girl!
So, let's go, my servant. <cf>Search them out quickly!
<cf> Oh, God, please help me!　Please help me!
(Noticing)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　I'll save him!
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. <cf> This must be a blessing from the gods of Buffalia.
You are Wahlkin, are you not? <cf> My disciples were worried when you didn't come back.
Ah, you have met that thing. <cf>It seems I have worried you.
<cf>A bad habit of mine, I was so engrossed in my investigation that I ventured too far into the depths.
<cf>And the next thing I knew, I was surrounded <cf>by enemies. No, it was a terrible blunder.
But this is how I live. <cf>This is also the result of my thick heart of faith in the Buffalo-Christian religion[--].
Yes, that!　We have come to ask you about <cf> matters related to the Buffalo-religious faith!
Can you tell us <cf> a little bit about the word "visitor"?
Oh!　You want to ask me about "The Visitor"? <cf>This is a good point!
[The word [raija] is found in a small number of ancient Buffalian texts.
<cf>The word "raija" is found in <cf>very few of the ancient Buffalian texts, and its original meaning is "gentile". <cf>In the ancient texts, Gentiles are described as having special powers.
Using this special power, the Gentiles......[raija] followed one after another<cf> around them.
Because of their power, however, the [raija] were sometimes considered heretics in ancient texts and <cf>wreakers of mischief</cf>.
But...!　I found a contradiction here!
[When I read the descriptions of the Raija, I find that they share many of the same powers and knowledge as the founder of <cf> the Buffalian faith!
In other words, the founder of the Buffalia cult was one of the [raija], and <cf>other raija lost the power struggle with the founder and were stigmatized.
Wait a minute. I can't understand a word of what you're saying!
Uh ...... you mean [raija] refers to gentiles, <cf>who have special powers ......?
Yes, they do!　And the founder of the Buffalian religion is most likely <cf>[raija] as well!
Here I have proposed a new theory!
The special power that [raija] possesses is not divine power, but <cf>further knowledge beyond our knowledge, that is, ......
<word size="Big" id="Raija"/><span size="Big">is a human being from another world! </>
No, no, no, that is indeed a leap too far. <cf>And that theory is subtly [discrediting] the founder, isn't it?
Ah, ...... I see. I think I understand why you were sent to Minsterhorn.
I am!　Because I have faith in the Founder, in God! <cf>I only want to reach the truth!
But the priests, who were foolish enough not to understand that, kept me away and forbade me to enter <cf>any religious site!
Oh ...... that's right. Especially "[Mihashira] of [kamigakari]"! <cf>They wouldn't even let us in there, where the founder suddenly appeared. ......
If we could investigate the "Mihashira" in detail, we might be able to find evidence that the founder was a "raija"!
The "Mihashira of KAMIGAKARI" ......
There must be a secret in [the Mihashira]! <cf> Even if it shakes the very foundations of religion, I [--]
Wow, I get it, I get it. I understand your passion.
Go home for now. See? <cf> Your disciples are worried about you.
Oh, yes, he is!　I had promised to <cf>discuss</cf> ancient civilizations with him!
He used to talk a lot!
Now, I'd like to go <cf> to the "Mihashira" of Kamigakari right away. ......
I'll have to <cf>report to the client, in the meantime.
Oh, you guys, thank you! <cf>As you can see, the doctor is back.
And the discussion started right away [--].
The more I look into that "Ruins of the Giant Tower" the more interesting it is. <cf>Don't you think so?
So, sir. <cf>How many times have I told you that that tower is a tomb of the Buffalian civilization[--]?
That's not right! <cf>In the first place, why do you declare that to be a tower!
The shape is indeed a huge tower. You can call it so. <cf>But some say that the reality is a huge cannon!
Isn't that just what the doctor says?
There are traces of something that looks like it was shot out! <cf> And from the angle, there is a celestial crest at the end of it!
So what does that mean: ....... Humans once <cf> tried to attack the god of Buffalia!
That's the kind of thing you say out loud, and that's why you get left out.
Now let me return to you. If that was a cannon, <cf>where did the people who built it go?
If they could make such a huge weapon, <cf>their technology must have been passed down to the present day!
Even with the collapse of civilization and the regression of technology,<cf> the ruins are far removed from today's technological standards.
The same is true from the viewpoint of architectural technology. <cf>It is inconceivable that a building of that size could have been built by human beings.
Then, that is clearly a relic of the Buffalian civilization. <cf>And the tall tower has an important symbolic meaning.
<cf>Many of the important structures of the Buffalo-Brahman religion boast of their height, such as the "Pillars of Kamigakari" and the temple at Asterlys.
In other words, "height" is the symbol of authority. The ancient ruling classes built tombs that reached to the heavens.
Gunnu...... my disciple, but <cf> a brilliant rebuttal based on the cultural background as well......!
No, we can't fall behind here! <cf>Mankind and the gods of Buffalia have a history of warfare[--].
Not only historical events, but also <cf>the lives of the people of that time[--].
Oh dear........., this is the master and this is the disciple. <cf>They both can't stop talking.
I can't listen to them. <cf>Anyway, I'm glad you're not hurt.
Now, we are going to <cf>go to the "Mihashira" of Kamigakari" to find out the secret of the "Raija".
The location is the "Bahamar Plateau. <cf>There are monsters much stronger than here!
Are you ready?
All right, let's go!　Let's go!
What do you want?　This is the Mihashira of Kamigakari. <cf> It is strictly controlled as a holy place of the Buffalia cult.
No one is allowed to pass through here without permission!
Wow, it was such an important place. <cf>I guess that's why I thought it was such a magnificent ruin!
<cf>You must be an amazing man to be the gatekeeper of such a place!
Hmm?　Well, is it?
<span size="Big">Yeah!　Cool~☆</>
Haha, not so much. Well, only those who excel in valor are appointed to this <cf>role</cf> within the Order, right?
<cf>After a rigorous screening process and battle, I finally won. <cf>Well, it's no big deal, right?　Haha!
<span size="Big">Wow, nice!　I adore you</>.
Haha, no, no, no, no.
Hey, Uncle? <cf>May I take a look inside for a minute[--]?
What a stinker! <cf>I said just a little bit!
I told you.　These are important ruins.
This is a sacred place where the founder of our Buffalian faith is said to have first set foot.
You think I'm going to let you in so easily just because I'm happy to receive a few compliments?
Then how could they let us in?
Well, you can't do that without the permission of the chief priests.
Now, you see what I'm talking about, don't you?　No matter how hard you try, <cf>you can't enter. You'd better leave as soon as possible.
Damn it ......, we have no choice. We'll settle down and have a strategy meeting around <cf>Larpal</cf>.
...... servant. <cf>Don't you think there is some strange noise?
In times like this, don't hesitate to ask around!
Hey, hey, what's going on?
Oh, there's a Buffalian pilgrim group nearby.
What?　It's not pilgrimage season yet?
You know, recently the Berkhmar was attacked by a strange monster, right? <cf> They're here to mourn the victims of that attack.
<cf>They say that the priestess Lugerio and the oracle priestess Einlein, whom we don't usually get to see, are also there!
What do you think? <cf>Would you like to go to Berkmar?
With my charm and good talk, I might be able to negotiate with the bigwigs of the cult and get them to allow me to go!
It is a fact that the more places people say they can't show or let you in, the more treasure there is in them!
<cf>We must definitely look inside the Mihashira when we come this far. <cf>Wait for me, treasure!
Um, excuse me. I heard that the chief priest and priestesses <cf>are here. ......
Um...
...... we are all offering prayers of mourning right now. <cf>Please don't interrupt me.
Um, how long do you feel that prayer will last ......?
Hmm, I'm at a loss. I don't know how long I should wait. <cf> Shall we look around there first?
Hmm?　That girl is ......
I'm glad I was able to help you out the other day. <cf> Are you a member of the pilgrimage group?
By the way, is there a chief priest or a priestess here?
...... is here, but what do you want?
<cf>I was wondering if I could get a little permission to enter the "Mihashira" of KAMIGAKARI.
...... Is that something you need?
(Surprise) ......
...... if you want.
Here ......
What a permit!
How in the world did you do that? <cf> No, no, wait. First of all, it's real!
Show it to the gatekeeper and he'll ...... know.
<cf> I'll show it to the gatekeeper and he'll tell you ....... Who are you? <cf>And why are you doing him a favor?
...... says he does.
I gotta go.
You're an elusive girl. ......
Anyway, I got my permit. <cf>Let's smack that gatekeeper!
Hello, Uncle! <cf>Yes, here.
This is a ...... permit! <cf>How on earth did you do that!
Heh heh, I'm a little acquainted with the great man.
I can't believe it ...... but this signature is real. <cf>No, but, I see, you can't simply let an outsider through ......
<cf>No, but if you doubt it, send a messenger to confirm it. <cf>We don't mind.
But if you doubt the authenticity of the permit, <cf>you might say that the eyes of the elected gatekeepers are blind?
If you believe your own eyes, this is unquestionably the real deal. <cf>Then let [Mihashira] judge ...... the rest. ......
<cf>There you are, you two, go on through. <cf>You have permission to enter the Mihashira.
Wow, thanks!
But [--] be careful!
...... What do you mean?
[The Mihashira has its own defense system. <cf> to keep out unwanted intruders.
If you are welcome at the Mihashira, then you will be able to overcome these challenges.
But if you are not [--]?
...... If not?
It is not <cf>my intention</cf> to retrieve the bodies of those who have exchanged words with ....... Go inside with an open mind.
<cf>Now, don't worry. <cf>Your skills are improving. Have confidence.
Now, let's go!　Treasure! <cf> In search of the mystery of the [raija]!
Hm...... it is indeed atmospheric......
Well, it's standard that there's a treasure at the top of these things. <cf>Let's go at once!
What is that?
It seems to be sealed. ......
Whoa!　What the hell? <cr>
I didn't touch anything!
(Surprise) Oh ...... oh ...... wow ......
(Surprise) Oh ......
(Dazzled and shocked) Ugh! ......
Servant!　The girl!
(opens eyes) ......
Erlinse-sama!
(Blown away by the impact) Kyaaaah!
(Blown away by the impact) Whoa!
(withstands roar and impact) Ugh...... ugh...... ugh......
(Eyes meet avatar) ......!
(Eyes meet Erinze's) -- oh my God!
That was ......!
Run!
(Stand up) Tsk......!
(Confronting the enemy) Ha!
(Blown away) Damn it! ......
You're going to save him!　This is Avaritia!
We can't just leave them to die!
[--]Yeah, you softy! <cr>
You managed to beat him. ...... <cf>Totally, that chilled my liver!
...... I don't mean to help you out, but be careful, my servant. <cf>They look suspicious.
They appeared differently from the usual space transfers, and <cf>they had some kind of atmosphere:</cf> ......
We are grateful for your help. <cf>But we would like you to leave this place immediately.
I will say no more. Leave. <cf>If you will not comply [--].
Tirith!　This man has <cf> risked his life for us!
But[--]!
!　This is ......
(Surprised at the surroundings) Oh ......!
(Upset by the surroundings) Oh ...... oh ......!
Don't tell me ...... that ......?
(Realization) --!
(Impact of exterior wall being broken) Ugh!
(Impact of exterior wall being broken) Kyaaa!
(Impact of exterior wall being broken) Ugh! --(Impact of the outer wall being broken) Uh-oh!
The Dragon King!
Voldigen......!
What the hell?
Is that the ......
The Dragon King......?
What an intimidating feeling......
I'm going to be crushed just by looking at him,......!
...... is it only this much power?
He ate ...... Avaritia?
(Bad situation & alarming) I'm going to have to go back to ......!
You're here, woman.
[--]! <cf> No, Erinse-sama, please run away!
But ......!
When did you guys return!
(Surprise) --!
[--]¡?　Dragon people!
You, from where!
Stop!
Stop!
(Running toward Voldigen, holding up his spear) <cf>Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
(He is struck and sent flying.) Whoaaaaah!
(When he dies, he is sent flying away.) Oh, my God!
[--]!
The winged insect is not worth ...... eating!
(readies his weapon) Damn ......
No, no, please run away!
It's none of your business!
...... I saved you once.
...... I saved you once.
We can't just run away here.
Huh?　You saw what I just did and you're still standing up to me.
That's good. That's very good.
Now ......
Let's kill this bug slowly, shall we?
First, the feet.
Then the hands.
Then the ...... head.
Oh, my God!　Tirith!
Alicia bless you!
Are you going to jump in this state?
(Attack on Voldigen) Ah!
You too, quickly!
(Attack) Hmph!
Kukk. ......
You're doing some crazy stuff.
Until that time comes, you'd do well to run for your life. ......
(Chuckles) Hahahahahaha!　Hahahahahaha!
Voldigen is not ...... here?
(Surprise) Ah!
(Surprise)!
It seems that you somehow escaped the difficulty ....... <cf>Mr. Ehrinse, you made the right decision!
However, are you feeling all right? <cf>To activate the device in that state is ......
......It's okay. It was only a few hours back there. <cf>The consumption of the chronograms was minimal.
Hey, who the hell are you people?
Why is Avaritia here, whom you supposedly defeated? <cf>And why is the Dragon King after you?
What <cf> is happening to us now?
As I was about to say, <cf>we can't talk about us,......
No, we can't just ignore what's going on now that we've been dragged into this!
There is a possibility, albeit slight, of space-time interference. <cf>Wouldn't it be too late for history to be changed?
My apologies. <cf>Again, my name is Erinse.
This is my squire, Tirith.
The events that just occurred......<cf>No, the events that I just caused......
[--]"Chronoleap".
Chronoleap......?
Yes, what you experienced was an act of time jumping.
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, so we were limited to going back <cf> a few hours. ......
The art of leaping through time ......?
I know it's hard to believe. <cf>But[--].
Let's get out of here for now. <cf>Vordigen will be here shortly.
Yes, I know. ...... <cf>We can't stand around talking, so why don't we go outside for now?
Then you will realize that what I am saying is true.
This time that you are in now is <cf>more in the past than it was a moment ago. ......
[--]¡¢No, no, no!　Don't, hide!
What?
(Surprised to see himself in the past)!
There were eagles and ...... servants ......?
We have leapt into the past[--]!
So that was <cf> yourselves a few hours ago!
No wonder you have defense equipment at ......[Mihashira]. <cf>I'm sure it would be unbearable to have such a device used so readily.
Yeah. ......?　Wait a minute. <cf>The founder who landed on the [Mihashira] ......[Raija], if that's what he is ......
[Raija], is that right?　......Yes, as I recall [--].
I heard that people in the past called those who "chrono-leap" like us.
Then you are [--].
Don't worry ...... about it, Tirith. ......
Excuse me, is there a place around here where I can rest? <cr>
If so, there is a settlement near here called Lalpar. <cf> You can rest there.
We'll be there too. <cf> There may be more questions we need to ask these guys.
Hmm?　You guys came out already? <cf>We just entered the Mihashira a few minutes ago.
And the two guys behind ......?　Are they with us? <cf> When did they join us?
They are alive ...... and ....... <cf>Oh, so this is what it means to jump back in time: ......
?　What are you talking about? <cf>What the hell happened inside?
No,<cf>...... well, <cf> uh, I mean - what can I say......
...... That sounds fishy.
This looks like I need to <cf>see for myself what happened inside ......
......!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　It's not safe to go there now!
Dangerous ......?　Then even more so! <cf>As the gatekeeper in charge of [Mihashira], I cannot overlook this!
<span size="Big">Wait!　You, death ......! </>
<span size="Big">No! </>
Why not?　Why can't you teach it? <cf>You could save one person's life!
By that gatekeeper surviving, <cf>I don't know what will happen in the future!
Such hyperbole ......
What are you sneaking around talking about. <cf>Anyways, let me check inside!
Not now.
Not now.
Unno....... <cf>......You're telling me not to go, by all means?
...... okay. Let's give it some time. <cf>If you've done what you had to do, you guys can walk away.
Phew. Somehow we managed to stop them. <cf>Well done, servant.
I understand your feelings. ......
Tirith: ....... <cf>You are not wrong.
But there is a line that even these people will not compromise. <cf>You know what I mean.
Anyway, let's hurry to the village. <cf>I'm worried about Master Erinse's health.
Are you all right?　Erinse.
Thank you, Tirith. <cf>A little rest won't be a problem.
I'm sorry, but before I do that, it's time for you to explain.
<cf>Who you are and for what purpose you have landed here.
You <cf>somehow know that we came across time and space ......, don't you?
Yes, I do. I and Tirith are from <cf>1000 years in the future!
A thousand years in the future? <cf>That's ridiculous[--].
No, because we are also <cf>timeless beings now. ......
So, it's just a different range of time that we've transcended, huh?
Thank you for being so quick to understand.
And?　What is the purpose of coming from 1000 years <cf> into the future?
...... is to liberate Avalithia.
Abaritia is a distortion. <cf>It distorts time and space just by being there.
The distortions created by Avaritia will gradually accumulate and <cf>in the not-too-distant future, will engulf this planet. ......
Such observations have been confirmed in our time.
The avalitia of our time <cf>has become so distorted that it is now unmanageable</cf>.
However, 1000 years ago,...... we could still do something about the <cf>avaritia of this time period.
We must find and free Abaritia and eliminate the distortion of space-time.
<cf>To do so, we have come from far into the future. <cf>To save this planet!
The story has suddenly become so grandiose. ......
But can we alter the past? <cf>It seems to me that it would be something troublesome. ......
We are more than considering that!
We have weighed the impact of the release of Aberritya, the scope of the changes, <cf>and the future of the planet.
Now, I have told you everything about us. <cf>Are you satisfied?
Mm, I understand most of it.
I see. Well, let me reiterate [--].
This story is a vital secret, and the chronoleap itself is <cf>a forbidden secret, not allowed to anyone but a select few!
Now that you have learned of them, <cf>you will now have to make a certain choice.
(Agreeing unavoidably) ......
Cooperate with us or ...... die. <cf>You may choose whichever you prefer.
Yes!
Cooperate with us or die. <cf>...... If you choose death, I will be serious!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. <cf>Please, servant?
<cf>...... you know I am not joking, right? <cf>Please make your choice here.
...... cooperate with us!
...... cooperate
...... Well, I guess I'll just have to answer like this
......Sorry!
I'm sorry for forcing you to do this. <cf>But thank you!
Well, if you say it's the future of the planet, <cf>I have to cooperate from an adventurer's point of view, don't I?
Yeah, and [--]
Yeah, and[--].
Again, you are not to speak of this to anyone else. <cf> If you tell anyone, [--]
Death. I know, I know.
Oh, yes!　If you insist, let's make a pact. <cf> Here, sign here.
All right.
(Unable to stop Feste) Oh, ......
(grinning)
Yes, I wrote it down. <cf>...... hmm?　A servant contract ......?
Yessir! <cf>So, I got a new servant!
Huh?　A servant?　Wait, wait [--].
I won't wait. <cf>This belongs to Feste now.
...... Erinze-sama, I still think we should <cf>delete these people!
<cf>Well, isn't it good? It's actually reassuring to have someone as strong as this as a collaborator.
Alright, then, my servant!　Then, my servant. Take care of your junior servants and make them useful to me, will you?
What?　You fell for it too?
Yeah, that's why I was called a servant earlier. ......
Well, you were Tirith's senior! <cf> That's reassuring.
Well, well, ...... I look forward to working with you for a while. <cf>'Senior'.
Now, I have a quick favor to ask of you all.
It's okay. I'm not asking you to move right away. <cf>When you're ready to rest a little and get ready, please give me a call.
Have you rested enough already?
When you are ready, <cf>I will tell you about my request.
Now, let's get down to business.
We <cf>have</cf> a device to search for avaritia.
However, it seems to have been damaged in the recent battle. ......
You mean the Omnistron? <cf>Maybe it is difficult to repair it? ......
No, it's fine. <cf>As long as you have the parts, you can manage.
Let me ask you a few questions:<cf>Is there a place where I can get a "luminescent core"?
Speaking of luminescent cores,<cf> I wonder if they can be taken from the Buffalia heritage machines.
If you want to find them in this vicinity, go to <cf>[valley] in [machine site].
Then, please collect those parts.
What, we're going there?
I have a duty to protect Erlinse-sama.
Then, I will go with you [--].
No. In truth, you have not recovered at all, have you? <cf> You'll be causing me more trouble than you deserve.
Anyway, Mr. Ehrinse and I will stay here. <cf>I'll leave the parts gathering to you. That's all.
My goodness, our new servant is rough around the edges. ......
Well, here we are, here we are! <cf>Let's get this parts gathering thing over with!
All right, servant, let's do it!
All right! <cf>We have successfully obtained the "luminous core"!
Now, let's get it to Tirith!
You got the luminous core?
Ah, here it is! <cf>This should replace the broken parts.
I'll go and incorporate it into the Omnistron as soon as possible. <cf>Please wait a moment!
<cf>On behalf of Tirith, I'd like to thank you for your help. <cf>Thank you!
Actually, it would be <cf>good</cf> if I could give you a proper one. ......
Then ...... it would be. <cf>I just want to check something.
You said ...... that those from the future are called 'raija', but <cf>can we know raija from each other?
Yes, I do. When we do chrono-leap, a special fluctuation occurs in the <cf>biological engram</cf> for a while, so we can see each other's <cf>behavior</cf>.
Well, then, by the way [--].
[When you first met this guy at the Mihashira, did you feel any of these special fluctuations?
No, not particularly. I thought he had a lot of engrams. ......<cf>
It seems that you are not a [raija]. <cf>Merlouf and the like are saying the right things.
Merlouf ......?
The repaired Omnistron has a reaction!
<cf>Anomalous reactions of engrams have been observed in the area known as "Montenol Valley" in this period!
Oh, an early discovery of avaritia!
Not confirmed, but perhaps. <cf>We need to head there and investigate.
I believe there is a <cf>village called Ritze in the Montenol valley. We should go there first.
I would like you seniors to go there first and gather information. <cf>We will leave after checking on Erinse-sama.
Hmm?　What is this?
It's a child of Omnistron. Please take this. <cf>It will enable communication with us.
Then, I will see you later in the village of Litze. <cf>Thank you very much.
Now let's head for Litze. <cf>Are you ready?
But avaritia in the Montenol valley? <cf>I don't think it would appear so readily.
The Dragon King, and those guys from the future.........<cf>What on earth is about to happen?
Hm?　Omnistron, is it? <cf>It's responding to something.
[Tirith here. Do you read me, senior? <cf>Please respond if you can hear me.
Oh!　I see. <cf>Oh, by the way, you said you could make a call.
<cf>Yes. Now we can share our location and information with each other. <cf>Good. It seems to work fine in this day and age.
That's not all. <cf>This way and that way: ......
<cf>This is Erlinse. <cf>Have you received it safely? >
Oh my!　The letters came up!
Not only can we make calls, but we can also communicate like letters. <cf> This is very convenient. This is indeed the tool of the future!
<cf>If we keep in touch with each other via the Omnistron, the liberation of the avaritia should proceed smoothly.
<cf>However, please do not use it in public without permission. <cf>Please be discrete. Bye, then.
What are you talking about?　I am not a child. <cf> You don't flaunt it!
<cf>If you want to be conspicuous, you are much more conspicuously dressed than I am!
<cf>I am sorry if I offended you. <cf> Tirith is really a very kind girl.
<Cf> I'm sure she's a bit preoccupied at the moment, being my only escort.
<cf>A different time, a different place. <cf> Please forgive my unfamiliarity.
<cf>I hope you will be able to help us. From Erlinse.
Unu ....... <cf>I can't be mad at you when you apologize so honestly!
Let's go, servant!　They can't help it. <cf> Let us teach you the ways of this age.
Oh, no?　We seem to have arrived earlier than you.
Because Erinse is in too much of a hurry. ......
We thought we would have caused you trouble if we didn't join you as soon as possible.
You see. <cf>Master Erlinse should be a little more dignified[--].
Lady Einleinne[--].
That girl ...... was the <cf>'oracle priestess' of the Order of Buffalia, wasn't she? ......
Do you know her?
I've only spoken to her a little. <cf>Well, I thought she was somewhat out of this world.
But why would a priestess of a cult be <cf>here</cf>?
It is a pilgrimage. She goes to sacred places and prays to the gods.
That ...... girl, with only that many people?
It is said that the more rigorous the process of the Buffalian pilgrimage, <cf> the more severe the process, the more the prayers reach the sky.
Besides, there was a recent attack by the dragon tribe, wasn't there? <cf>That has caused a bit of a stir in the world.
<cf>The anger is directed at the Order. <cf>["]What is God, who is supposed to protect the world, doing? [The people are afraid.
The people are afraid. The dragon tribe has suddenly been activated, and <cf>Avalithia has begun to appear. ......
To appease them, they make such an untimely pilgrimage, <cf>in an attempt to dispel the people's distrust of them</cf>.
In fact, the <cf>people</cf> would have a hard time complaining if they see a girl like that enduring so well. See?
Is the God who protects the world ...... or ......
Do you believe in God?
What is this all of a sudden? Are you soliciting me?
That's not what I mean. ......
If there really is a God, why does he force some people to endure <cf>and be unreasonable?
If God can receive my wish, I wish for a world where everyone can live <cf>equally</cf>.
Well, it's just a dream.
But dreams can be within our reach if we don't give up. <cf>I believe so!
...... We must not forget our purpose. <cf>Let's make the search for avaritia our top priority for now.
Omnistron is responding. <cf>It appears that they are southwest of this village!
(Noticed)!
There it is!　It is Avaritia that should be liberated!
Alright!　That's my servant!
Well done!
We've defeated Abaritia. Is that all?
No, not yet. Defeating her is not enough. ......
What is it, ......?
Quiet.
(Hold your mouth) Ugh. ......
Now we will perform the ritual of the liberation of ...... avaritia!
(Ritual movement like blowing on the air) Huh ......
(Surprise) Ah!
This is ...... what ......
Interfering with space-time
And released the [twisted] causality of the avaritia back to <cf>its original state.
The [twisted] twisted causality ......?
Do you <cf>know</cf> how ...... avaritia is born?
(Shakes head, not knowing the answer) Ugh......
You have met your past selves.
What if at that time [--]you killed yourselves?
Nah?
Well, ......
The past ego dies.
In the future, the living eagle will cease to exist. ......
The future eagle will never return to the past.
I will no longer be killed by future eagles ......
The eagles of the past will be alive and well.
But then, the eagle from the future will come to kill me and kill me. ......
I don't understand!　What will happen?
As you are now wondering, there will be a great deal of inconsistency.
And the unresolved contradictions will distort space-time.
The existence born from this distortion of space-time is avaritia.
That is avaritia.
How ......
The only one who can correct this [distortion] is <cf>Ms. Erinse, the only one who has a special biological engram ......
(collapses due to ritual exhaustion) is ......Gucc......
Large ...... sturdy ......
...... after all, this ritual is very draining!
Excuse me, we will return to the village ahead of you.
You may do so. We will join you later.
Thank you for your hard work, seniors.
Yes, it is a great honor to welcome you. <cf> How is Erlinse?
She is sleeping now.
The reckless chronoleap and avaritia liberation ceremony......<cf> must be taking more of a toll on her than we imagined!
Well,...... I hope she recovers a little.
Um,......
What's wrong?
<cf>Thank you so much for your help in liberating Avaritia!
And I apologize for my initial rudeness.
I made such a terrible choice, and you <cf>still helped me out like this. ......
Oh, don't be so awed. <cf>I'm not good at that sort of thing.
For us, it's just the right amount of boredom. <cf>Boredom rots adventurers. See?
I feel better now. At some point, <cf>I thought I should properly apologize and thank you.
You will continue to release <cf>avariety</cf> in a similar fashion in the future, won't you?
That is the plan. But ...... the Dragon King is ......
Voldigen. I didn't think there was a <cf>monster</cf> that would eat Avalitia. ......
...... However strong the dragon tribe may be, can it eat <cf>avaritia?
...... However strong the dragon tribe may be, can they eat <cf>avaritia?
Normally, it is impossible. <cf>But a Vordigen can.
Because [--]Vordigens themselves <cf>have already turned into avaritars.
What?
The Voldigens are a dragon tribe that is <cf> originally sealed away</cf> in this time period.
Did you know that in prehistoric times, there <cf>was</cf> a war between the dragon tribe and the Buffalian god tribe?
Yeah, ......, though that's more of a myth.
It is not a myth, it was a fact. <cf>Voldigen is the Dragon King of that era.
The Dragon King, who was <cf>sealed</cf> by the Buffarian Gods after he turned into Avaritia, was awakened in our time. ......
He saw the dragon tribe in a state of decline, unparalleled to the past, <cf>and started a great war in an effort to restore his power.
In doing so, he fed on other avatars in order to increase his own power.
As a result, in power and distortion,...... Voldigern has surpassed the boundaries of <cf>ordinary avaritaires!
A kindred eater. Not a horrifying ......
But then, <cf>Erlinse trying to liberate Avaritia is nothing more than a distraction to him.
...... He must have come into our time because he heard that we are planning to <cf>liberate Avalithia<cf>!
It would be meaningless if he were to liberate Aberritya, which would be his power. <cf>That's why we are trying to eliminate Mr. Erlinse ......
And by the way, if <cf>Avalitya in this time period, when the distortion has not yet become bloated, you can eat all you want......?
If left unchecked, <cf>Voldigen will grow more and more powerful.
And this planet will be under his control in the not-too-distant future.
So, please ......, please, please protect Eälinse-sama with us!
Please help us to carry out your aspirations, your desire to protect all people living on this planet. ......
Please help us reach <cf>Avalithia before the Dragon King does and help us achieve <cf> its liberation. ......
Sure, I'll help.
Ho-ho-ho, leave everything to Feste-sama here. <cf>It is in the Lord's capacity to do what you servants ask of him!
Who are these servants, at all?
But thank you for ....... <cf>I'm really reassured because I've always been anxious ...... to be alone!
Now, as soon as Erinse is able to move, <cf>I can go on to the next Aberritya liberation!
Yes, I am. The next one is ...... I believe it is called <cf>"Soundless City" in this era!
Hmmm... ...... "Soundless City"?
That place is under the jurisdiction of the cult. There should be few people going in and out. <cf>The nature, the treasure is also ...... guffaw ...... guffaw ......!
(Stupefying) hah......
After all, that amount of engrams is ....... <cf>What on earth are you thinking?
Oh well. I'll just keep doing what I do.
I'll just ...... show you. <cf>Your "will".
Well, now that Erinse is feeling better, <cf>we can head for the "Soundless City", right?
Here we are! <cf>There is the "Soundless City" at the end of the hall.
Kuku kuku kuku kuku ...... I can smell the treasure ....... <cf>I can see ...... the [Golden Road] to debt repayment!
Our top priority is to liberate avaritia. <cf>Don't forget that!
<cf>I know. <cf>Treasure is an afterthought, an afterthought!
Now let's go to ...... again!　Treasure [--] Gohon! <cf>Towards the liberation of the second Avaritia!
...... I see. <cf>There's a nice atmosphere here, even if Avalithia is there.
(OFF action scene) Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Is there anyone else besides us?
That's not good!　Treasure first ...... No, no, no.
It'll be a nuisance if we collide with Avaritia!
(OFF action scene) Huh... huh...
(Blown away, kneeling down - fatigue) -- huh! Huh... huh...
Are you all right, my Lord?
...... is not safe ahead.
You guys need to get the hell out of here.
(looking at Carveen) ........!
(Looking at Carveen) ......
He can't take the fight any further......
(Agreeing with Eirinse) Nn!
Is that Avaritia ahead of us?
Yes, sir. The bio-records match.
It's one of the Aberrities we need to take down.
I'll go. Take a look at him.
I'll go. Take a look at him.
Erlinse and Feste, please.
Erlinse and Feste, please.
I'll take care of this place.
Please, take it easy.
(Nods and braces himself.) N...... gg!
It looks like it went well. <cf>As expected of my first servant!　You did well!
This one did not go so well ....... I've given him some first aid, but he'll need to be treated in the right place.
Could you please take this man and head for the exit first?
We will stay here and liberate <cf>Abaritia</cf>.
Well, that would be better. <cf>But will you two be all right?
I am Erinse-sama's escort. <cf>I will protect you even at the cost of my life.
Besides, my senpai defeated the main enemy.
All right. Then, we will take him and go on. <cf>There is a garrison of the Order on the way. That should be fine.
<cf>Thank you very much. <cf>We'll be right behind you.
Hm?
Did you not hear the omnistron ring just now, my servant?
Oh?　You have a message from Tirith.
<cf>This is Tirith. <cf> Thank you for defeating Avalithia.
<cf> A vanquished Avalithia will disappear in a few minutes to a few hours.
<cf>If you don't release it during that time, you will have to wait until it comes back to life. <cf>How long that will take: ......>
<cf>As soon as the liberation ceremony is over, we will be on our way to the garrison.
<Cf> How is the injured young man? <Cf> I'm sure he'll be fine, but it's not a serious wound.
＜We'll see you later.
He's surprisingly disciplined, isn't he?
Well, let's hurry to the garrison.
Oh, I noticed. How are you feeling?　How are you feeling, big brother?
Is this ......?
It's the garrison of the Order. <cf> Don't worry, we've defeated that avaritia☆.
Avaritia ......
Abaritia!　I knew it was Abaritia!
(Pressured by Carveen's momentum) Ugh......
Oh, oh. Yes, it is. <cf>What, you were fighting without knowing it?
Abaritia on the Order's holy ground......<cf>Is it as he said......
......What in the world did the Knight Commander ......
Knight Commander?
Oh, no,....... <cf> Uh, you guys saved me?
Yeah!　Tearing and throwing the attacking avaritia<cf>Tearing and throwing...... was easier than [twisting] a baby's hand!
That avaritia like a baby......?
How amazing!　Please let me call you master! <cf>No, I want to call you master!
Don't you think it's possible that I beat him? ......
No way!　Such a pretty, pretty girl, <cf>the one you're supposed to protect, fought with you?
......!　Ho, ho, ho! <cf>You are quite a sight to behold. I like it!　What's your name?
<cf> What's your name?　My apologies. I should have said my name first. <cf> My name is Carveen.
I am Feste. This is my servant. <cf>By the way, what are you doing there?
That's ......, I'm just doing some research. <cf>A friend asked me to ......
...... but on the way there, <cf>I got caught off guard by that avaritia ......
Yes, I know!　I have to thank my mentor. <cf>I've been saved, but I'll lose my gratitude if I don't!
...... Hmm?　Huh? <cf> My wallet, is it missing?　You must have dropped it in that battle!
Okay, let's go pick it up. Let's go now. <cf>And give me all the money!
But ...... wouldn't it cause unnecessary trouble for <cf>Master</cf> to go pick it up now?
Besides, I should originally repay the favor with this body. <cf>But I also have a favor to ask from Yoruk: ......
...... I see. There it is!
Please take it!
Is this ...... an Imagine Seed?
Master ...... Oh, no, it's not a master, <cf> it was given to me by another master.
It's an imperfect Imagine Seed, and I've never been able to use it, but ......<cf> it's strangely calming to have it!
To others it's a piece of junk, but to me it's my most treasured possession. <cf>So, I hope you'll at least give me this.
Of course, I'll thank you appropriately later. <cf>But that's all I can do for now[--].
...... Hey, hey, servant?
What's the matter?　You're not remembering?
(Was that my memory?　Or ......)
（Was that my memory?　(or ......)
Carveen?　He's already left. <cf>Young people recover quickly, I like it.
Even if they give you an Imagine Seed you can't use. ...... <cf> Well, it may come in handy. Keep it with you.
You are a very noisy fellow, aren't you? But you had a good eye for finding me <cf>pretty and cute</cf>.
Carveen. ......<cf>I'll make you pay for it next time I see you. ......
Oh, did the liberation of Avaritia go well?
Yes, without a hitch, thanks to you. <cf>By the way, where is that guy?
He just left. <cf>It didn't seem that important.
I see. Good. ......
Well, what's next?
Northeast of here...... in this time period would be the desert......? <cf>There is an avaritia response to be released over there.
Desert...... Oh, the "Salamzat" one. I believe there is <cf>a barrier on the way there. Let's go through there.
Well, everyone, are you ready?　<cf> Let's head for the barrier.
Do you wish to pass through the barrier?
[If so, you will need a guarantor.
What?　A guarantor? <cf> There was no such system before, was there?
It started a while ago. <cf>...... you see, a lot happened in "Barnhardt", didn't it?
So, <cf>Mr. Dunkirk, the head of the Ducal Order, who is acting on behalf of the king who recuperated, came to Salamzat to greet you.
So, the Salamzat side requested <cf>stricter checks<cf> on the entry of the general public.
I see. ...... <cf>A politically sensitive time, I see.
And what about a guarantor? <cf>What kind of person should I ask?
<cf>Yes. Basically, someone who has <cf>permission</cf> from the Salamzat side, or [--] someone who has been living in Asterlys for more than 10 years.
<cf> who has lived in Asterlys for more than 10 years.
What a hassle - what's that?
It's also a hassle for us to check every single thing. <cf> But it's a rule, so what can we do?
Anyway, please have your guarantor certificate ready. <cf>That's a condition for getting through customs.
So, do you have a ...... guarantor for you?
Well, in a case like this, it would be the owner of the coin-operated pavilion.
I believe he's had his own store there for over 10 years.
Do you know him well?
Yes, I do, and so do my servants. <cf>I'm going to owe him another favor, but I have no choice.
<cf>If he is someone you both trust, <cf>we can trust him with our confidence.
<cf>Well, then, let's get on with it. <cf>We will leave for Asterlys as soon as possible!
<span size="Big">We need you to vouch for us! </>
<span size="Big">Suddenly!　You're borrowing money from a bad place! <cf>We don't accept cosigners!
No, I'm not!　It's the identity. The guarantor! <cf> You need it to pass through the barrier!
Ah?　Oh, ...... that. They say Dunkirk is coming. <cf>What, you guys going to Salamzat?
Yes, I've got some business to attend to. <cf> But I was told I need a guarantor.
Well, I don't mind, but ......
You've got two pretty babes with you, but <cf>you didn't do anything wrong, did you, ......?
<cf>I didn't do anything wrong! <cf>I'm rather helping people!
[--] I'm saying, are you sure?
Ha, yes! <cf>Mr. Feste and the others have been helping me a lot!
Tirith here has also been welcomed as <cf>a new servant of Feste's</cf> ......
New servant......
Yes, we also have a senior servant, <cf>who gives us guidance and encouragement every day!
Senior servant......
Let me think about the guarantor for a minute.
We didn't really do anything wrong!
Haha, just kidding. <cf>I know you guys ain't that kind of guys.
...... has one condition for being a guarantor
Oh, what's that? Other than money, I'm all ears.
I need you to help me fix this guy up.
Hmm?　The Imagine Seed?
Yeah, I broke it in my carelessness. <cf>I'm in a great deal of trouble if I can't use this thing.
Hmmm... ...... What kind of Imagine Seed is this?
It's to get in touch with my brother.
Huh?　You have a brother?
Yes, I do. He's taking over the family business for me, the prodigal son. <cf> What, you think it's funny that I have a family?
No, well, ....... Oh, right, family. ......
If that's the case, I'll take care of it. <cf>So, what do you need to restore it?
Sap of the spiny dogwood. <cf>It takes a certain amount.
<cf>You can look for it on the Litze trading road. <cf>It should be available in that area quite often.
I'm asking you. <cf>I'll be your guarantor or co-signer if you can fix the Imagine Seed!
Let us take care of this, and you can get some rest.
No, sir, we'll check out the surrounding area.
Well, be careful.
Oh, you brought what I asked for. <cf>Thanks for this. Thanks!
Leave the rest to the experts. <cf>As long as you have the ingredients, you should be fine, right?
<cf>All we need is the material, right? I'll be your guarantor as promised. <cf>Wait a minute.
You've got what you need.
Mm-hmm. All is well. <cf>And you, have things been all right?
Yes, everything is fine. Thanks to our seniors.
Here, here's the deed. <cf>It is properly watermarked with the Asterlys watermark.
Oh!　That's what I'm talking about! <cf>A friend is a friend to have!
...... I hope you can communicate with your <cf> brother with that Imagine Seed!
Yes, I do. <cf>Well, he's always complaining.
You should take care of your family. <cf>If you're alone, you can't even listen to him complain.
<cf>Well, that solves the problem of the guarantor. <cf> Now, let's get back to the barrier!
Do you wish to pass through the barrier? <cf>Then we'll see your guarantor's certificate.
Hmmm......... you're doing it right. <cf>All right, please come through.
Okay, now we can pass through the barrier with a big wave of the hand. <cf>The desert is already in front of us!
It's been a while since I've had this dry wind ......
<cf>I see you have traveled through the desert before, Feste!
That is reassuring.
<cf>Well, don't be alarmed. <cf>Leave it to my experienced hands here!
(Panting)
What's wrong!　What's going on!
There's a monster up ahead! <cf> Are you adventurers?　Then help us!
There's still one girl left! <cf>You took the bait and let us go ......
Please!　Please let that girl [--]!
(Surprised) Uh...... uh......
(Shoots his gun) Hmm......
What's with that priestess!　She's so strong!
You guys are adventurers, right?　Lend a hand[--]!
Gohonk! <cf>You adventurers, right?　Lend me your hands!
*For voice division* <cf>You're adventurers, aren't you?　Please lend me your hands!
Oh, oh?
You guys go ahead and <cf>rescue the decoys, please!
I'm going to beat the crap out of the guys around here!
I don't know, but I guess we'll follow the priestess for now. <cf>We're going too, servant!
[--]!
There they are!　Servant!
(Running away from the enemy) Haa...... haa......
You're so persistent!　That's enough!
Stay back!
They're coming! ......!
Thank you. Thanks for the help. ......
I heard you took the bait yourself. <cf> You're a fool for taking the bait. ......
I'm not reckless. I have confidence in my legs. <cf>I've been trained on stage.
<cf> Stage?
(smiles) Hmmm.
I am Charlotte. I'm one of a troupe of traveling performers.
Well!　Traveling entertainers! <cf> I've never met you before!
Really? <cf>Then you must come and see our troupe!
We're going to be performing at the Salamzaat down the road. <cf>You should come and see us if you like. My songs are well-received.
<cf>Yes, definitely!　I'm looking forward to it.
...... No? <cf>I've never seen a performance before. ......
I'm afraid I have no choice now.
Thanks, Tillis. I love it!
You must be so boxed in. <cf>So, you guys are the escorts?
Well, something like that. <cf>By the way, are you alone?　Where's the rest of your troupe?
They should have arrived at Salamzat before you. <cf> I was just going to pick up a few things I forgot. ......
Hey!　Charlou!　Charlotte-oo!
Oh, just in time. <cf>I guess my buddies are here to pick me up.
Well, I'm going to go. You should definitely come see the performance!
A performance by a traveling troupe of entertainers, huh? <cf>Maybe I could go and listen to her singing?
Yes, by all means, let's go!
I will be <span size="Big">prepared and ready</span>!
Well, well. Now that we've done our job, let's get going.
It's dangerous to wander around the desert needlessly. <cf>First, let's go to the town that will serve as our base.
This is the oasis of the desert, <cf>Salamuzat</cf>!
What do you think? <cf>Doesn't it have a unique atmosphere?
That's because this is a town <cf>made up of peddlers, nomads, and drifters!
Rest assured, we have everything we need to live here. <cf>It is a perfect base for adventure!
Hmmm, I see you got the [light-colored wind]. ......
This is a phenomenon that often appears in desert areas. When it appears, <cf>temporarily the flow of engrams is disrupted.
I see what you mean. ......
Don't tell me you can't use omnistrons?
I knew it was a phenomenon that occurs on the ground in this time period, but <cf>I didn't think I would actually encounter it!
I'm so sorry to hear about this. This makes it impossible to <cf>know</cf> where Avaritia is.
Well, calm down. <cf>Wait a while and it will subside.
But we <cf>can't just sit around and wait. The Dragon King must get there before us. ......
Is there a Buffalian temple here?
Hmm?　Yes, most large cities have them.
Then let's go to the temple. <cf> You might get a hint of avaritia!
What?　Why would the temple have information about Avaritia?
Anyway, trust me now. <cf>Please!
This is the temple of Salamzat. <cf>Now, who might know about Avaritia: ......
Oy!　Is anyone here?
Oh?　You are ......
Oh, you are the strong priestess of yore!
My name is Elektra. <cf>Thanks for your help on that occasion!
What happened to the girl who took the bait?
Don't worry. She should have arrived in town before us. <cf>With our help, even the fiercest enemies will be dealt a blow!
Oh, how wonderful!
Thanks to you, a girl's life has been saved. <cf> The God of Buffalia must be very pleased.
Now, I would like to ask you one question:......<cf> Have you seen a girl dressed in a priestess's robe different from mine?
She is a member of the pilgrim group and was supposed to meet us here, but<cf>I couldn't find her no matter how I looked for her. ......
Pilgrimage group ......?　The girl in the maiden's robe......?
...... No way, Einlein?
Do you know the oracle priestess!
<span size="Big">Sheesh! </> Saved me the trouble of explaining!
Kohon!　...... Yes, it is Lady Einlein. <cf>I was his escort.
I came here to replace my predecessor, but <cf>that all-important priestess is not here. ......
......He's always wandering off in a daze. <cf>How many of our bodies are there in the world, and how many of our bodies are there in the world?
Hey, you're leaking your true feelings.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. Well, that's why, if you <cf>know</cf> Mr. Einlein, could you please lend me a hand?
What do you <cf> do, servant?
...... I'll take care of it. If you are a priestess of the oracle, you <cf>should</cf> have more information about Avaritia.
I will tell you why later. Anyway, now that Omnistron is <cf>unavailable</cf>, I'm willing to take any chance!
Oh, Lord!　Have mercy on these people!
Master Einlein must be in this city. <cf>Please let me know if you find him!
Sis, continuing the story...
What happens when there are beasts?
Oh, ...... yes, yes, continue. <cf>That "beast" has destroyed all the old civilization.
But the beast is not bad. It is the humans who are bad. <cf>Because we have treated ourselves as the best. ......
Such a tragedy must never happen again. That's why <cf>we must worship the God of Buffalia and be modest[--].
What a bore.
Is there any more interesting stories that will make you feel like "wow"?
I'm not sure... ......?
The Beast That Destroyed the Old World? <cf> Surely, it must be a bit boring for children.
But ...... the only other story I can think of is the doctrine of ......
<cf>There are other ways to soothe a child, even if it is not a story. <cf>This is how to soothe a child: ......
(Sings a cappella)
...... and, well, here it is
What was that song?　It's beautiful!　Tell me!
Oh, me too!
Ho-ho-ho, you like it? Okay, okay.
You know, ...... I want you to teach me that one, too. ......
Oh, you've attracted the attention of the oracle priestess, too. <cf>But actually, I don't know much about it either: ......
Oh no, there she is!　Einlein-sama!
(frightened) Wow~!
Please don't wander off by yourself. <cf> I've told you many times it's dangerous.
Here, I'm going. If you don't get over your wanderlust, <cf>I'll have Master Lugerio scold you!
Wait!　That ...... you ...... about avaritia!
Go ahead. <cf>I have to talk to these people......
Huh?　But [--]
I will return properly. <cf>...... I don't want Lugerio to scold me.
Well, these people can ......
Excuse me, can I have Lady Einlein, please?
Do you want to ask me about ...... Avalitia?
Please <cf> tell me where I might find Avaritia in this vicinity. You are in trouble too, aren't you?
....... <cf>Most likely she is in "[Mushitoride] in [Akatsuki]" ......
How do you know that?
I have to get back soon. <cf>Lugerio will be angry with me......
...... It is <cf>not</cf> a good tendency to keep secrets from one's fellow travelers!
I am sorry. One day I will tell you all about it.
After the liberation of Avaritia, it's all ......
It's a creepy place ....... <cf>Let's get this over with.
You can afford this guy now!
Well done!　That's the third one!
Senpai!　Behind you!
(Realization) Oh, ......
(Surprise!) Oh, ......!
[Avoid!
(Reacting to the voice that's been called) Ah!
(Stabs spear) Mun!
(Jumps while pulling out the spear) <cf>Eaaaah!
(Landing) Oh!
What a ...... blow or ......!
You're very good, but you're still ...... not quite there yet.
Mr. Dunkirk!
Sorry, Veronica. I beat you to it.
No, we are more ashamed of ourselves for falling behind.
Dunkirk......? <cf> Dunkirk, the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Barnhart?
...... these men?
They are our first guests. They were fighting Aberritya earlier. <cf>Maybe they are stronger than you?
I know that the Commander is not blind, but I will not be defeated by some <cf>who-knows-what</cf>.
I don't think you can take a joke at all. <cf> Well, that's what I'm buying into.
Haha...... sorry about that.
I have seen your fight. <cf>I see you are a renowned adventurer.
...... but it would be too risky to bring a weakling to such a place, no matter how skilled he may be.
Avaritia is like a mass of engrams. <cf>Albeit a corpse, what effect can it have on you if you are near it......
Get to safety quickly. It seems<cf>that there is no such treasure here as you seek.
...... It seems to be a very old ruin. <cf>I think there is no need for further investigation.
We are going now, what about you? <cf>I will escort you to the exit if necessary.
No, we are fine. <cf>We will be grateful for your kindness.
<cf>Adventurer's pride, huh? <cf> Then we will take our leave.
May you all have good luck on your journey!
Ha~~ ...... I'm surprised. I never thought I would meet the Knight Commander of the Duchy of Barnhart at a place like this.
Well, ...... it's about time for Erinse and the others to come out after <cf>the liberation ceremony.
Thank you for your patience. ...... <cf>We were able to complete the ceremony without incident.
Phew. ...... <cf>This is finally the third one!
By the way, is the person you just mentioned famous?
Knight Commander Dunkirk. A man of valor and civility, <cf>a model of a knight.
I had heard that he had recently replaced the ailing Duke as regent with a <cf>higher civil official</cf>. ......
What brings you to this place?
...... you said something about investigating ruins.
I see, I'm curious. ......
Okay, I'm going back to Salamzat as soon as possible. <cf> I have to let Erinze rest.
Sorry ......
And while I'm at it, I'll report back to Einlein. <cf>Avaritia's informant.
...... I still can't use Omnistron. ...... <cf>[Kousai Fu] still has an effect on ......
............? <cf>......Chichu ...... responded ...... to ......... ...
--What?　The communication is ......!
Hey, Tirith! <cf>What are you doing there?
Ah!　Uh, ......
...... is not working.
Hey, Tillis?
Excuse me!　I'm coming!
...... Huh, you released the third one too. <cf> It's time to ...... ......
That ...... avaritia is ......?
That was totally not scary at all!
So ...... good ......
It seems that Lady Einlein has <cf>given you guys a lot of leeway!
Well. I'm sure that's <cf>a credit to my virtue, isn't it?
...... But seriously, <cf>why are you being so good to us?
What is it?　You're making a lot of noise.
Oh, it's probably because a traveling troupe of entertainers is about to perform!
<span size="Big">Performances! </>
Tirith, Tirith!　The troupe is performing!
I understand your concern, but can we talk about this a little later? <cf>You need to rest now.
But I made a promise to the girl. ......
I wish I could go see it too.
I wish I could go see it too.
...... already, you seniors are so sweet.
I understand, let's go. <cf>But if you get tired, tell me right away. Okay?
It's hard work there too. ...... This one, too, Einlein-sama <cf>wants to see the performance, and she's spoiled.
Because ...... a reputable diva will be there. ......
Oh, well. <cf>That Charlotte is quite a rumor, isn't she?
I'd like to hear her even more. <cf>All right, let's go to the plaza, my servant!　We'll take the front row!
Oh, you're all here! <cf> Soon, the pride of the Gilwet traveling troupe, the diva, will appear!
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Next up is our troupe's fastest-growing diva. <cf>Miss Charlotte!
Hey everyone~!　Hello~!
(waving and cheering for Charlotte) <cf>Wow!
(cheering for Charlotte while waving her hands) <cf>Hoo~hoo~hoo~hoo~hoo~hoo~hoo~hoo!
(Waving and cheering for Charlotte) <cf>Huff!
(Cheering for Charlotte) <cf>Hoo-hoo!
Charlotte, the diva of us all! <cr>
I'll make you my prisoner!
(waves her hand at the audience and laughs)
Kyaaaahhh!
It's her!
(Noticing) Ha!
Run away!　(Seeing the assailant on the stage - running away)
(Seeing the assailant on the stage - running away)
Take them alive.
Save her!
You have to save her!　Please!
Lady Einlein, what's wrong with that girl? <cf> Are you an oracle?
No. Not this time. <cf>I don't know. ......
Please, please help that girl. ......
Hurry up!　They've gone out of town!
(Action scene) Deyaaaa......Yeahaaa......<cf>Uh...... hooooo... ...ho oh oh oh ...... oh ...... oh!
(Action scene) Ugh..!
(Action Scene) <cf>Hohohoa...... oh...... oh...!
(Action Scene) <cf>Ugh......Hoh......Hoh......Oh......Oh! Oh!
(Action Scene) Ugh...... Oh!
Master!
Master!　I'll leave that one to you!
That's what I'm talking about, Master. You are a brilliant fighter!
But I never thought I'd see <cf>Master</cf> in a place like this!
(Looking at the fallen armed group) ......
You, why are you being targeted?
I'd rather hear it from me!　Why ......
Senior!
You were in the soundless city......
...... Oh, that time! <cf>I'm pretty sure you patched me up?
Tirith. Glad to see you are well.
The city is fine. The chaos has subsided.
We also carried a member of the troupe who had collapsed on the way to the city. <cf> That level of injury should not be a problem.
(Relief) ......
Thank goodness......
We'll go to Salamzat too. <cf>There might still be some of these guys around here.
Ah!　That's mine! <cf>When did you drop it!
......I'm going to ask you something I can't get my hands on, where did you get this?
Huh?　Oh ...... this is ......<cf> a clue to the guys who took my mom.
The ...... that took her?
......When I was little, my mother was taken by a strange group of people. <cf>That's when they dropped this.
I've been holding on to it, hoping it would lead me to something, but <cf>I ended up with no idea what the inscription on it meant or anything. ......
Sorry for the ......[brusque] question!
No, thanks for picking it up. Thank you very much.
Let's go, Master. <cf> If we dawdle, we're going to have other enemies.
Why is that thing ...... in this day and age?
Char!　You're safe!
These people saved me. <cf>By the way, is everyone ok?
Yeah,...... no one was seriously hurt, well, to a certain extent. <cf>But they're all strong, so they'll be fine soon!
...... Those people were after me, weren't they?
It's ...... my fault......
Don't carry yourself so strangely. The troupe is a family. <cf>It's natural to protect your family!
Now, get some rest. <cf>I'm sure you're tired after everything that's happened.
I'm going back to the others. <cf>I'll be sure to thank you later!
You should rest too, Master. Fatigue is the enemy of travel.
Well, I must join my friends. <cf>Then excuse me, Master!
Carveen is right, we should take a break. <cf>I think there's a "rest stop," right? Let's go there.
Well, I think we can get plenty of rest here. ......
I'm so sleepy. I'm at my limit as well. ......
You too can sleep. <cf>The trick of traveling is to sleep when you can. ......
Suyaa......
Mother!　Mother!
I'm going after ......
(sigh - realization) ......
This little thank you isn't enough!
Wa! <cf>Awww! ......
Where do you think you're going? <cf>Maybe their friends are still out there!
Because ....... <cf>I'd get us all in trouble if I were there.
So, <cf>I'm going to hide somewhere until I can figure out exactly what they are.
Where is where? <cf>And how do you know what they are?
I know a good place to hide.
Carveen! <cf> Hmm?　Why are you with Einlein?
My friend ......
I originally came here to meet Einlein and <cf>another friend.
But I had to change my plans a little ......
I need to lay low for a bit, <cf>would you like to go with me anyway?
What?　...... Yeah!
She won't let me help you.
Why ......
I don't know either. <cf>But...... because I care about you......
Einlein has offered me a safe house. <cf>There, you can calm down and think about it.
I know you're confused, but I think you can trust me. <cf> After all, Einlein is an oracle priestess.
<cf>An oracle priestess!　This is the girl!
And ...... Carveine is a knight of the duchy.
Oh my!　Did you hear that, servant!
I'm sorry for not telling you, Master. <cf> There's a little reason why I'm here: ......
As she says, I belong to the Order of Barnhardt. <cf>I'm on vacation right now: ......
What do you think?　Are you willing to go with me?
Hey, I don't know what it's about, but ......<cf>At any rate, please take care of me now!
Yes, I will.
Rest assured, Einlein, my master. <cf>I will protect her in the name of my knighthood.
Contact Yorke, are you sure you can handle this alone?
I'll get him to cooperate. ......
Oh, I see. Then I'll be at ease too.
Well then, Master. I'll see you somewhere else!
Thanks again and again for your help. <cf> I'll pay you back for this one day!
Dunkirk, Knight Commander of the Duchy of Barnhart: ......<cf>And Carveen, a Knight Commander but with a reason: ......
Something smells fishy here: ......
I have a favor to ask. <cf>Come to the ...... square later.
You came to ask me for a favor?
I'm sorry to call you to this place. ...... <cf>I didn't want others to ...... hear about it. ......
Oh?　There seems to be a reason for this. ......
I want to see my friends without telling Elektra and the others. <cf>...... very, very important appointment!
So please take me to <cf> the Fountain of the Hermits</cf> on the <cf> Plain of Orbid</cf>.
What will you do?
I accept.
Thank you ......!
Well, we needed to let Erinse rest, <cf> and this is a good way to kill time in the meantime.
And the reward will be [--].
Hey, what's that look in your eye? ......<cf>Oh, God, I get it, I get it!
Well, this girl has helped me a lot. <cf>I will accept a fair price.
<cf>Well then, my servant. <cf>When you are ready, we will go to the Fountain of the Hermits.
Where are your friends? <cf>I don't see anyone, but ......
This ...... was down: ......
Hmm?　Is that a ...... handkerchief? <cf>It's folded very tightly.
Or rather, it's so unusually clean that it's <cf>terrifying</cf>. ......
These nervous folds are Yorke's ......
If it belongs to the person who is waiting for us?
We were supposed to meet here. <cf>What in the world......
Look at this.
Look at this.
Hmm?　Faint human footprints. <cf>They're very disorganized.
And ...... this is a dead insect ......?
<span size="Big">!　Oh my God! </>
What's the matter?
Yoruk, I don't like bugs!　They are my natural enemy! <cf>I turn blue just at the sight of a small one!
If you were attacked by a big one here [--]!
Oh, calm down!　First of all, you calm down!
First of all, follow the footprints before they are erased by the wind. <cf>There is a good chance that Yoruk and the others are there. Okay?
Yoruk ...... stay safe ......
<cf>He must have fled to the southwest, judging from his footprints. <cf>Hurry, my servant!
The footprints are disappearing around here. <cf>No way, he's already in the belly of the worm. ......
What's the matter?
...... Mwah, bugs!
......Good, we'll take care of it!
...... You've shown up!
Avenge Yoruk and the others! <cf>Servant, do it!
Phew! ......<cf> At least I can mourn for you!
Einlein!
Yoruk!
Oh, oh?　What? <cf> You're alive!
Thank goodness you're okay. ......
Yeah, well, somehow. <cf>I'm sorry I worried you.
I was attacked by a bug, and I ran out and hid there for a long time. ......<cf>
So why don't you get the hell out of here?
I thought you passed out again. ......
I can't collapse before I see you ...... <cf>I'm just trying to keep my strength up there.
It's just the two of us.
You didn't have to push yourself ......
I'm pushing you too hard to begin with. <cf>Then I should be trying too.
I agree. I think I did my best this time.
Haha ...... Einlein praised me.
Hey!　Don't forget us!　Totally ....... <cf> If you're so bad at bugs, think a little bit about where you're going to meet up with us!
Sorry, sorry. We couldn't stand out. ...... <cf>I just couldn't find a good place.
How about ......?
Oh well. We might get bugs again if we stay here. <cf>If your body's okay, let's head for the tent.
Sorry to call you out here.
By the way, who are these people?
I asked them to escort me here. <cf> These people are fine.
Hehe ......
It's very unusual for her to rely on someone else.
Sorry for the delay in greeting you. I'm Jorg. <cf> I'm Einlein's childhood friend.
Oh, by the way, where's Carveen? <cr>
He's on a love getaway with his little diva.
Eh!
There was a traveling performer girl who was being targeted by strange people. <cf> He went to a safe house to protect the girl ......
Hey, what, that's how it is.
I didn't think that Carveen, who is all about the martial arts, has a girlfriend! <cf> and I was so impatient......
You seem to be very shy yourself, don't you?
No, no, that's not<cf> what I meant when I called Einlein.
What do you mean?
You don't have to pursue it!　Uh, you <cf> have something for me from Carveen, don't you?
Here it is: ......
...... I see. Father is ......
Well, in lieu of a reward, let me ask you this. <cf>What are you doing?
<cf> A priestess of the oracle who works in secret from her congregation. <cf> A knight for a reason from the Duchy of Barnhart.
And the two of them must meet in secret<cf>Ousama ......
Oh, by the way, I met Dunkirk, <cf>the Knight Commander, at the [insect fortress] of [Akatsuki].
Was it because of Dunkirk that Carveen 'had to change his plans and go into hiding'<cf>?
I'm having the two of you <cf>research</cf> something I'm a little concerned about.
But since it's only a personal matter, <cf>Carveen has been given a leave of absence from the Knights<cf> and ......
I was wondering if Father's lightning would strike him if he found out.
Father?
Knight Commander Dunkirk is my father.
(surprised) Eh?
So please don't tell the Knights about this. <cf> I don't want my father to be angry with me either.
My father is especially strict with me and Carvain. <cf>["]Both of you should be a fine cornerstone of the Duchy! ["]] and so on.
I'm glad he has high expectations for us.
Now, I know most of what I need to know. <cf>Thanks for coming, Einlein.
Yoruk...... okay?
Excuse me, could you <cf>please send her to Salamzaat?
Oh, oh. <cf>I thought your request included that much.
Thank you very much. I'll look forward to working with you, sir.
See you later, Einlein. Good luck on your pilgrimage!
I'll be back soon. ......
That young man Jörg, ...... is quite a player.
I think he was telling the truth when he told us. <cf> And he doesn't want Dunkirk to know about it either.
But he never told us anything important about ...... the truth.
I often use the technique of telling a few truths to <cf>smoke out</cf> what I really want to hide. ......
Ah!　Einlein-sama!
You disappeared on your own again!　Do you know how much we <cf>worried</cf> ...... about you!
<span size="Big">The face of the god of Buffalia has been seen three times! </>
I'll have Master Lugerio scold you this time!
Ugh......
Speaking of which, why are you and Master Einlein?
Lost!
I went for a little walk and got lost ....... <cf> And these guys saved me.
Oh yes. <cf>When I went outside, I saw a familiar figure wandering around~?
Walking ...... lost......
Huh ....... <cf>Well, let's just leave it at that ......
Come on, let's go back. <cf>The congregation is all waiting for you, Lord Einlein.
Thank you ....... <cf>Come to me if you need any help.
<cf>Well, that's all we have to do. <cf>We should probably get together with Erinse and the others.
They should be at the rest stop.
Thank you for your hard work. <cf>What happened while we were resting?
We would love to hear about it!
I see...... Einlein and the others are working in secret <cf> from both the Order and the Knights, aren't they?
Actually,...... we would like to tell you something as well.
...... about an old man.
An old man?
He may have been ......<cf>chronolept!
I have no proof of this, but I think it<cf>is quite possible.
And where is this old man?
A bar. He seems to be ...... poor and <cf>living off the bar's leftovers. ......
Hmmm......
Chronoleaping is a forbidden art. <cf>We, for our part, can't leave it alone.
Mm....... <cf>Servants, let us go and talk to them just in case.
Alicia bless you. ...... Alicia bless you. ......
'Alicia bless you' ......? <cf>This word, somewhere ......
...... It's the activation word for the Chronogate!
Ah, yes!　You mentioned it, as I recall!
Yes, I did. <cf>Only those who perform chrono-leaps are supposed to know this!
Then this old man is ......
I asked around and it seems that he drifted here <cf> several years ago and no one knows his past ......
Moreover, he is not very ...... clear minded and <cf>not able to hold a conversation!
I don't know if you can understand this. ......
I don't want to disturb him by talking to him without warning,<cf>but I don't know if I should leave him like this.
<cf><cf>We've been agonizing over it together with Tillis for a long time.
It's a difficult question, but ......<cf> it's easier said than done, isn't it?
Hey, Grandpa! <cf>Would you like to have a little chat with me?
<cf>Are you sure you want to do that, Mr. Ehrinse?
<cf>I'm sure you'll be fine, Tirith. <cf>Let's leave this to Feste-san!
Hey, hey, hey, grandpa!
Blessings on ...... Alicia. <cf>Alicia ...... of ......?
[--]!　You are!
Huh?　Me, is it?
Oh, no way, no such ....... <cf> No, no. But ...... oh ......!
Um, what am I?
O God of ...... Buffalia! <cf>Thank you for this meeting that has come to us in our last hours.
Gentlemen, we <cf>have something to ask you.
Why did you say those words [--]?
From the looks of things, you are adventurers. <cf> Then will you accept my request?
If you successfully fulfill this old man's wish, <cf>I'll answer anything!
What, you think you can have a normal conversation and it's a deal? <cf>So, what is it you wish to request?
...... "The Flower of the Wind of Sand". <cf>Please give me that flower that he loved so much.
Senpai, may I accept this request? <cf>I just can't bring myself to leave this old man alone. ......
Yes, I'll take it.
Yes, I'll take it.
But, "Flower of the Wind of Sand"............ <cf>What kind of thing is that?
I have seen it in a picture book. <cf>I think it is a beautiful flower made of sand crystals. ......
They say it is an accidental product of the wind in the sand.
Go look for that accidental product, he said. <cf>Isn't this moderately challenging?
Yes, it is. <cf>There's just too little information. ......
[--]Yes!　Can't Einlein use <cf>the Order's intelligence network to do something about it?
He said, "[If you have any trouble, come to me."[--]<cf>Let's rely on him as soon as possible!
I agree with Feste. <cf>The Order is looking all over the place, so it is possible!
All right, let's go see Einlein as soon as possible!
Oh! <cf>I've got a problem, so I'm here as soon as I can!
...... what?
<cf> Haven't you ever heard of the "Flower of the Sandwind"? <cf>It's a flower made of sand crystals. ......
...... Electra, Electra!
What's going on? <cf>We are not suspicious!
You wanted to see me, Einlein?
[You're not suspicious, are you? <cf> Are you the ones?
I need information on "The Flower of the Wind of Sand".
Huh?　What is it, out of the blue?
These people helped me out, so I have to return the favor. ......<cf>
Is that what you mean by "The Flower of the Wind and Sand"? <cf>Totally, you're always short of words.
Well, okay. <cf>I'm just in the middle of gathering topographical information on the surrounding area, and
How ...... is something going on?
Oh, ugh. Don't worry about it. <cf>Anyway, it's "Flower of the Sand and Wind".
Please wait a moment. <cf>I'll ask the local congregation if they have it.
I'm not sure if it's still there, but <cf>I could tell you where I saw it a few years ago.
Do you have a map?　Let's see, ...... it's around here.
Thank you very much. You're right, it is a cult.
This is a lot easier than catching Lady Einlein.
How long have you been out of sight? ......
...... Uh, is that all right?
Yes. Thank you for your time.
Oh, you're going too?　Please be careful. <cf>Don't do anything unnecessary and don't get hurt.
Erinze is not used to fighting, so <cf>please protect her well, Tirith.
......?　Yes, that, of course.
Well, I'll leave you to it.
Now, now that you have the information. <cf>Let's go to the place on this map!
Let's go to the back of the house, shall we? <cf> Let's search thoroughly.
Looks like we'll have to take it down!
Phew, it's blooming! <cf>This is the Flower of the Sandwind, isn't it?
Yes, it is. As seen in the illustrated book,...... no, it's much more than that!
A miracle of nature's creation. <cf>The fragile crystals of sand that break down within a few days......
How beautiful it is....... <cf>I can't believe such a beautiful thing exists in this world.
<cf>There are so many miracles in this land that we do not know about!
Yes, Mr. Ehrinse. If we hadn't gone outside,......<cf> if we hadn't come to the past, we wouldn't have known.
Yes, truly ......
You are the reason I share this excitement with you. <cf>Thank you again for following me, Tirith.
...... But why did that old man <cf> want this?
He said things like ["]old age["], so <cf>is it a souvenir of the underworld, or is he selling it off for money? ......
Is it so ......? ......
You will know when you bring it back. <cf>Let's go, senpai.
Oh, please, gently, please. <cf>Gently, gently......
Here, "Sand Wind Flower". This is good, isn't it?
Oh ...... oh ......! <cf>Yes, that's it!
I think we've accomplished what we set out to do. <cf>Now, then, answer a few questions.
Why were you muttering "Alicia bless you" <cf>?
...... While this broken head is still clear, <cf>Listen to a fairy tale!
A long time ago, a very long time ago. <cf>There was a priest in the Order.
<cf>He had a woman whom he admired. <cf>However, she had lost most of her feelings.
<cf>The priest wanted to somehow make her smile, as she spent her days expressionless, like a machine.
It was at that time. Suddenly, the woman muttered, <cf>["]I want to see the flower of the sand wind..."].
It was a small, small murmur. <cf>It was an unconscious murmur, like an exhaled breath.
<cf>The priest, who happened to hear it, embarked on a long journey in search of the "Flower of the Sandwind.
He must have wandered around for several years. <cf>After finally obtaining the flower, he returned to the woman, but[--].
<cf>The priest was enveloped in a strange light, <cf>and was hurled into a strange land!
...... Yes, a strange land. The place was still the same, but <cf>the people, the culture, everything had changed!
It was as if time itself had been transcended,......<cf> such......
The priest traveled in search of a way to return to his original time. <cf>But everyone saw it as a delusion and took pity on the priest,......
And so,...... the priest himself thought that everything was his own delusion,<cf> and time passed away.......
...... those words were muttered by the woman. <cf>If I remember that much for sure.
(After all, this old man was ......)
(Was he involved in the Chronogate accident ......?)
I will give you this "Flower of the Sand Wind"!
So, please ...... smile at me. <cf> A fake smile is fine. Just for now, please.
Oh, um, I am
Thus ......?
Oh ...... thank you. <cf>I guess this is what it would have looked like if that person had smiled
Now I have nothing more to think about. <cf>I've lived to this age and my journey is finally over......
The old man ......?
It's been a long time since I've talked to you and I'm tired. <cf>[--]Oops, I should thank you.
I'm sorry, but could you <cf>[--]give me a moment to prepare a thank you? Yes, you may. ......
I will deliver it to the rest area later, <cf>Please wait there.
Ha, ha. ......
Thank you very much. Now then,<cf>......
...... That old man told me to wait here,<cf> but I hope I'm really going to get paid!
A sub, an adventurer, and two women......? <cf> You guys, the old man at the bar ......
Oh!　You know him? <cf> We're here for the old man.
Yeah, that old man's dead.
What ......?
At his age, he must have had a chronic illness. ...... <cf>But I hear his face was peaceful in death.
I didn't know that. ......
Something tells me I was the last person to see him.
I was asked to do a favor for him, as I was the one who was serving him[--]<cf>It seems you guys are the right people to be dealing with.
They wanted to thank me for the "Sandwind Flowers." ......
Ah, ah, yes. <cf> Then it must be us.
Well, here you go. I gave it to him.
Is this a ...... commemorative coin of the Order of Buffalia ......?
It's quite an old one, too. <cf>It is probably from the time of the first ...... founder ......
Then, after all, that old man!
Yes, I know. But nowadays it's no longer ......
Ah ......!
Tirith?　What's wrong?
The Flower of the Wind of Sand has been shattered......
...... I'm sure she delivered the flower through you to <cf> the one you were thinking of!
We have finally reached the end of our journey. <cf>So don't ...... cry, just smile at him!
......Now!　Change your mind and go to the Temple. <cf>Maybe there's some info on the next avaritia.
We don't have time to stand still. <cf>Don't you agree?
Oh!　You've come to the right place!
You guys [--] Gohon! <cf> I have a favor to ask of you.
A favor?　What's that?
You guys beat Avaritia, right?
Huh? <cf>[--]Ah!　Einlein, you spoke!
I'm sorry. ....... <cf>I was hoping you could help me: ......
Is something wrong?
Actually, <cf>avaritia appeared in the order we had planned!
[--]¡ª　There were others. ......
I've been collecting and reviewing information for a while <cf> in order to rearrange the route to a safer one,
If we avoid that one, we can't go this way. <cf>Avoid this one and you can't do that one... and on and on...
We thought it would be <cf>faster</cf> if we defeated Avaritia, but we didn't have enough manpower to do so.
I thought it would be <cf>quicker</cf> to defeat Avalithia, but we didn't have enough manpower, and I was worried that there wouldn't be <cf>any</cf> fools who would fight Avalithia, even if we tried to send a request to adventurers!
I see. There was a fool.
That's right.
Let's go home, servant.
Wow!　I'm sorry, it's a lie! <cf>I have never met such fine adventurers as you!
It pains me to have to rely solely on you, but ......<cf>the congregation is simply not up to the task. ......
And ...... we can't afford to delay the pilgrimage any longer. ......
Of course, I'll play the honorarium! <cf> You know, Mr. Einlein?
Oh, yeah. ...... <cf>Tell Lugerio and you'll be fine!
I'll play the gratuity, you say!
Well, if that's the case ......? <cf>We can't leave avaritia alone, can we?　Right?
Well, I'll take you there. <cf>When you are ready, please come outside the city.
Mr. Einlein will stay here with you.
<span size="Big">Don't ever go out, okay?
<span size="Big">...... the face of the god of Buffalia too? </>
It is ...... until the third time ......
Very well.
Well then, please do me a favor.
I don't know if the new avaritia is something that <cf>should be released since Omnistron is not available ......
I can't leave it alone if it's causing you trouble. <cf>I will help you in any way I can.
However,...... would it be safe to take that priestess Electra with us<cf>?
It should be fine. Or rather, isn't she a force to be reckoned with? <cf>She seems to be quite skilled.
<cf>Well, don't worry, I'll be able to fool her when I release Avaritia!
Well then, senpai, I look forward to your continued support.
The [kousai-fu] is subsiding. ......
Let's go. <cf>Avalitia seems to be at "the [whispering] cliff.
However, I am somewhat sorry. <cf> Even though it's a request, I'm sorry for making you go along with something dangerous.
Basically, the Order wipes its own ass with Avaritia. ......<cf>No, I should be responsible for it, but...
<cf> No, I should be responsible.　Why not?
Well, the Order keeps <cf>avaritia</cf> in the Holy Land.
Yes!
What?　Because, you see, they capture and contain the avaritia and <cf>effectively retrieve and utilize the engrams[--].
......, you know what?　Huh?　Huh?
Did <cf>Einlein-sama</cf> tell you about this area?
I didn't.
No way! <cf>After being so friendly with her!
Oh, no!　Now, nothing! <cf> I didn't hear you, I didn't hear anything. Good!　Yes good!
That's not good!　The way you put it, <cf>the Order's definition of holy ground is [--].
Ahhhhh, I can't hear you! <cf>Yes!　Let's move on!
As I recall, you once said.
[The priestess of the oracle might have <cf>more information about Avaritia[--] ...... and
I see. It would make sense if the Order <cf>has</cf> an avaritia in the Holy Land.
...... remember <cf> the place where we first met!
The device for chrono-leaping......<cf>you saw Avalitia by the "Chronogate", didn't you?
To make an accurate chronoleap, <cf>the corresponding fuel......chronograms
And to run the chronogate, <cf>a large amount of engrams are needed!
So, that avaritia was <cf>the power source for the gate ......?
The Chronogate is just one example, but the engrams <cf>collected through the use of avalitia are used for many things!
The Avalitya Sealing Mechanism. ......<cf> That is the truth of the Holy Land, as the Order calls it.
<cf>Who are you to know that? <cf>It's about time you told us, isn't it?
......We'll talk again when we're done with this matter.
Is that okay with you, Tillis?
Hey!　What are you talking so slowly? <cf>Get your ass over here, man!
Here they come!　Avaritia!
...... is really strong. <cf>If we're not careful, we'll be in trouble too!
We did it!　It moved!
What do you think?
Biometric records match. <cf>It's the avaritia that should be released!
Miko!　I just saw a <cf>einlein-like figure over there!
Huh!　No way!
Really, really. Come with me!
I told you that the Buffalian god's face is not mentioned three times!
Now, let us release the avaritia!
This response is from ......!
No way ......!
Voldigen ......!
Time is full.
(flashback recollection & surprise) Ha!
Run away!
(Stand up - notice)...huh..!
(Noticing) Ha!
(Electra throws him to the ground) Ugh!
Elektra-san!
I'm done babysitting the kid.
(SURPRISE) Ah!
(Surprise) Ha!
...... flerbe?
......?　How do you know my name?
No, Mr. Ehrinse!　This Hrelbe is [--]
(surprised)
Shut up messing around!
(Electric shocks flying at his feet - he looks up.) Gghh ...... hah!
(Electric shocks flying at his feet) Geez!
What do you mean ......?
It's easy, isn't it? <cf> You guys were tricked by me and lured here.
<cf>You were lured here by me, and it was worth it. <cf>This is how I can be of service to you, Mr. Voldigen.
VOLDIGEN-sama. <cf>As reported, that woman must be ready to eat, right?
(Surprise!). ......
...... Yeah, that's more than enough.
What ......
Master Voldigen has been waiting for the woman's bio-engraham to be activated <cf> by the release of avaritia.
In other words, you guys have been playing in the palm of Voldigen's <cf>hand the whole time!
Let me help you, woman.
The rest of you [--]what kind of death do you want?
...... This is quite a desperate situation!
...... I'll take Voldigen. <cf>You take Electra [--]Frelbe.
...... I'll take Voldigen. <cf>You take care of Electra[--]Frelbe.
Feste, when you see an opening, you take Eerinse and run.
Feste, when you see an opening, take Erinse and run away.
Servant, you ......
We will survive, all of us. We must.
We will survive, all of us. We must.
(Agreed)!
Let's go!
(Receive attack - attack) ............ Hmph!
(Running - looking at Voldigen in the sky) <cf>...... Taaaaaaahhh-- hah!
You are a good warrior.
(Generating fireballs ~ throws them) Huh ...... Hmph!
(Receives fireball & is blown away) Gghhhh....
(Damaged and unable to get up) Ugh...
You have struggled well.
As a reward, I give you a painless death.
Mr. Erinse ...... ......!
[--]Don't do it!
(She begins to suffer in response to the star lullaby.) Ugggghhhh!
Mr. Voldigen?
Ugh ......!
VOLDIGEN-sama!
(Suffering) Ah... aghh!
The song ...... is ......!
A song?　Such a thing [--]!
(Suffering) Ugh... agh...
(Getting up with wounds all over his body) -- huh -- huh!
Guh... ......!
(Suffering) Ugh... ahhh...
Mr. Voldigen!　This is for me!
You are ...... what in the world ......
(Surprised)--!
...... Oh, yes!
Death at the hands of Lord Voldigen is <cf> too good a prize for you!
Let the winged insects take their deaths at my hands in a quiet manner!
(Avatar attacks.) Ugh ......!
Damn it ......!
Flerbe......
That memory......
Ugh! ......
Well, somehow we all survived.
Oh, by the way, Voldigen said <cf>"Song" ......
Is this ......?
What a mysterious Imagine Seed! ......
Well, there's no point in doing this. <cf> Let's go back to Salamzaat once.
Erinse and Tirith must be tired. <cf>I, too, am exhausted.
......I know, I know. Let's go back.
Phew...... you're back at last. <cf>Too many things have happened, I'm tired.
......Yes, it is. As expected, I'm not so sure this time.
Okay, I'll ask Einlein to <cf>rest in the temple[--].
No. ......
Let's make it ...... a resting place.
There is also the matter of Elektra. <cf>Let's not go near the cult for a while.
It's not like there's only one dragon tribe hiding in the Order. ......
First of all, thank you for your help. <cf>You all managed to get through this without incident.
It's like a miracle that we're here like this right now.
It's thanks to my senpai. If it were just me, maybe ......
It's a wonder, isn't it? <cf>Something like this...... makes me feel like I have a clear path ahead of me!
This sound ...... from Omnistron?
No way,......!
Can you ...... it?　Tirith. Come in.
Mr. Bashlar!
Bashlar!　Tirith, you--
I'm sorry ....... In exchange for the chronogram, <cf> promise to report back to me regularly: ......
...... I see, I see.
This is Tirith. We have confirmed normal reception.
Sorry for all this time. <cf>[Kousai Fu]'s influence was greater than expected. ......
I would like to confirm something more than that. <cf>Is Erlinse-sama safe?
For voice division* Is Erlinse-sama safe?
Yes, he is. There was an attack by the Dragon King Voldigen, but <cf>we got through it thanks to the cooperation of our people.
Have you already made contact with Voldigen? ...... <cf>It is [fortuitous] that you have remained unharmed until now.
For voice splitting*<cf>It's [fortuitous] that we've been able to stay safe so far.
<cf>We did not expect the chronoleap of Voldigen.
It is dangerous to be in that time any longer. <cf>Master Erlinse, your safety is our top priority, and you must return home immediately.
*Cf>Master Erlinse's safety is our top priority, please return immediately.
But there is still the liberation of Avaritia at ......!
You are there, Master Erlinse. <cf> I am relieved to hear your voice!
Although we are on different paths to a solution, we are both concerned about the future. <cf>I am not falsifying my feelings for your safety.
For now, please follow our instructions. <cf>For the sake of our future.
Tirith. <cf>Take Lady Erinse to safety, will you?
*For audio division* <cf>Take Erinse-sama to safety, okay?
...... seniors, this is my last request. <cf>Will you please take us back to [Mihashira]?
Last ......
until we leave this age. <cf>...... at least stay with us.
If we reach the Chronogate, we can say goodbye or ....... <cf>It was long and short.
Yes, it was. ...... <cf>Thank you for all your help to our seniors.
......This is really the last time!
...... Tillis.
Hmm? <cf>What? Is something wrong?
...... No, it's nothing. <cf>Let's go.
If you go through the portal there, you'll find the Chronogate.
My goodness, it's still a big tower.
If you have any last words, this is the last one.
You see, we've been through a lot, haven't we?
You know, we've done a lot of work on the future and all that.
It wouldn't hurt to leave a little something behind, would it?　Hmm?
I can't thank you guys enough for all the help you've given me.
So ...... at least listen to me!
Let me tell you the story of Erinse, the Buffalian Goddess.
You are ...... of the Buffalian Gods......?
You are the ...... god ......?
You are a ...... ha ha ha!　What a joke at a time like this.
If you're going to lie, do it a little better.
You look just like an ordinary human being, don't you?
That's because we humans were created in the image of <cf> ourselves by the Buffalian gods!
Yes. ......?
Long ago, in order to win the war against the dragon tribe, the Buffalians created a weapon that was rich in <cf>biological engrams</cf>.
That is the [--]human.
But after winning the war against the dragon tribe, the humans joined forces with the sub-humans and rebelled against us, the gods.
Abandoning the earth, we moved beyond the sky, <cf>waiting for a long time for the time when humans would repent. ......
We manipulated the cult on earth in the form of an "oracle" from the heavens and <cf> made ourselves into a myth!
The Avalithia Sealing Mechanism controlled by the Order. The culture of the Gods is built on the engrams collected from there.
In a manner of speaking, Avalithia is our lifeline.
Were you liberating it?
Were you letting it go?
The [distortion] of a bloated, out-of-control avaritia is <cf> destroying the world ......
Then I thought, I tried to do what I could <cf>do</cf>, but [--].
Bashraal opposed me, saying that even for the sake of the world, liberating Avaritia would lead to the suicide of <cf>civilization</cf>.
But I did not want to save the ...... planet, and at the same time, I did not want to further exploit the Avaritia, who were trapped in the cause <cf> of their own murder.
I wanted to free them and <cf> then seek a new future.
Mr. Ehrinse.
Thank you for everything you have done for us so far.
I may be <cf>unny</cf> to comment on a journey with the future of the planet at stake [--].
I had a very ...... good time. <cf>I have never had so much fun in my life!
It was a real pleasure meeting you guys......
......Well, what the hell, let's have a good time!
I've never had so much fun in my life!
Come on, let's get going!
Even if it's been ......1000 years
Don't forget about us!
(Surprised to see Bashraal.) Ha......!
Bashraal!
I didn't expect you to come in person. ......
It is the duty of our subjects to rush to the aid of the royal family in their time of need.
I'm glad to see you are safe, Erinse.
Do you have a chronogram on hand?
Ah, yes!
That's all I have.
...... Who is this person?
He is a collaborator of this era. <cf> Thanks to you, we were able to defeat Voldigen [--].
(Bashraal blows him away.) Whoa!
Servant!
(startled) Ah...
What are you doing?
(He's blown away.) Hey...!
Tirith!
(Scared) Ah...
Bashraal...... you......
(Faints) U...... are......
(Can't get up) Gu...... are......
(Can't get up) G......
Your part in this is over. <cf>At least as a reward, live in peace in these times.
<cf>"Blessed be Alicia."
(stands up) huh huh...
Help Erinse to ...... help ......
This voice ...... from ...... Imagine Seed?
If this continues, she will be used for the 'plan'. <cf> If that happens,......
(surprise) ......
Find Charlotte. <cf>The way to the future is for her to ......
Charlotte is ...... in the ...... 'carte d'homme' ......
Wait!
She's stopped talking .......
What's the plan,...... you don't mean, Mr. Bashraal, really,......?
Wait!　Where do you think you're going?
We have to get to Khartoum as soon as possible!
If that Imagine Seed is right, <cf>Master Eirinse is ...... Eirinse's life is ......!
Calm down. It's not safe to go alone. I'm coming with you.
Calm down. It's not safe to go alone. I'm coming with you.
...... I'm embarrassed to even ask this now, but...
Where is Khartoum ......?
You started running without knowing where it is!
Duh, because I thought I could find it by looking at a map! <cf> But now that I look at it, the details are not so clear, so
<cf>Servants, it seems we were right to follow you. <cf>There's some confusion here!
I'm sorry ......
Kartoum is an archaeological site in the desert. <cf>It is located further east of the Hermit's Fountain.
The Fountain of the Hermits' ...... is where you met Yoruk.
The Hermit's Fountain, ...... where you met Yoruk.
Mm-hmm. If Charlotte is in Kartoum, it may be the hiding place that <cf>Einlein</cf> has prepared.
It would be troublesome if others found her while she was hiding. <cf>I'm in a hurry, but I'm going carefully.
...... waiting for you
Waiting?　Did you know we were coming?
Einlein is an oracle.
He told us to bring Charlotte here and <cf>help you. ......
...... If you are the "oracle" that has been cooperating with us all this time, then who are you really?
Who are you really ......?
[--]I'm sure you'll come across something that will <cf>connect</cf> to your memories.
[My name is Erinse.
[--]To save this planet!
...... To know that, I want to help Erinse!
......To know that, I want to help Erinse!
We were told to meet Charlotte. <cf>Ms. Erlinse was kidnapped, and so [--].
I'm supposed to give you this pendant, right?
I don't know, but ...... you need what's in this thing, right?
Bullshit....... <cf>How did such a high-purity chronogram get here!
Huh?　Hey, what? <cf>Is it really so great?
It's nothing amazing, <cf>all of us can make change with one of these chrono-leaps!
A black leap?
（Oh...
And anyway, with this, <cf>I can go save Erinse-sama!
Thank you. I promise I'll pay you back later.
Thank you. I'll pay you back later, I promise.
(In response to the avatar's line) Yes.
Good luck to all of you in your fight.
Let's go, senpai. <cf>"Go to the [mihashira] of [kamigakari]. Go on from there.
Hey, my lord, <cf> what is this pendant all about?
I never thought I would be named by the oracle of Einlein. ...... <cf>You are all strange people.
By the way, did you have <cf>something</cf> to do in Carveen?
No, I <cf>heard your names from Einlein and came here with you.
For some reason, I felt that I <cf>had to meet you all once before returning to my home country.
Hmmm... ......?　I don't know what it is, but if you <cf>need</cf> help, just ask.
Carveen and Einlein <cf>are</cf> no strangers to each other.
Well, not right now, of course.
Yes, I'm sure you all have things to do.
I will do what I can, in my own way. <cf>If that's not enough, let me know and I'll be happy to discuss it with you.
<cf>Take care. <cf>May you all have good fortune in your battles.
Now, what dangers await you in the future. ...... <cf>Do not be unprepared!
The man who took Erinse......<cf> I believe his name was Bashlar.
What is your relation to him?
......Master Bashlar was my superior in <cf>Zorksia.
Would you like to call him a thought group ......? <cf>It is a group to which many powerful people belong, even within the God Clan.
My father and my grandfather have always been Zolxia. <cf>So it's no surprise that I am also a member of ......
Master Erlinse's power has been a <cf>problem inside Zorkyia for a long time.
Being close in age, I was told to serve <cf>Master Erlinse</cf>, including as a guard and ...... monitoring.
But the more time we spent together, the more I <cf>came to truly want to serve him.
I was touched by Erinse's feelings......<cf>and I couldn't leave her alone even though she was a little dangerous.
And yet ......I ......!
Tillis's feelings are properly conveyed to Erinse.
Let's go help her. Together.
[--]Yes!
Is this your time?
Yes, it seems we were able to jump safely. <cf>As expected of a high-purity chronogram, even three of us had plenty of time to spare!
Why is Charlotte ...... such a thing? <cf>That thing about being attacked by a strange group, that guy is a mystery too.
<cf>We are concerned about that, but right now we have to rescue Erinse-sama first. <cf>Anyways, let's move on!
(OFF action scene) Ooooh!
(OFF action scene) Eat me!
(OFF action scene) Jamakusei!
(Action scene) Orah!
(STAND UP) Hmph!
Hrelbe!　Why is he here!
Please calm down! <cf> That Hrelbe is on our side!
On our side?　What are you talking about?
(to Tirith, who starts walking away without answering the question) <cf>Hey!
<span size="Big">You're late, Tirith! </> What the hell did you do?
I'm sorry, where's Erinse?
He was taken to the research facility down the road! <cf>Don't waste time, let's go!
An ......?　Hey. What's with those guys?
People who helped us in the past. <cf> They came with us to help Erinse.
(Isn't he that Frelbe?) <cf> Why did he help us? <cf>Why did she help us ......?)
(She was found in a state of suspended animation several years ago. <cf>She had lost her memory before that. ......)
（<cf> She had many things happen to her, but Erinze-sama protected her, and <cf> she is now serving as a kinji, just like me.
(I see. (I see. So you are an ally. <cf>He doesn't even remember us.)
<cf>I'm getting an itch when I see you guys. ...... <cf>It makes my old wounds tingle. ......
No, no, it's just your imagination.　Faces like ours are common <cf>everywhere</cf>, aren't they?
Oh well. We're welcome to your side. Let's smash that idiot Bashraal <cf> with his stupid "plan"!
A "plan"... ....... As Tirith said, <cf>what the hell is that?
...... "The Avalitya Shell Project."
Simply put, it is a plan to create a special avaritia to control other avaritia!
Well, is that even possible?
In theory, yes. However, in order to control the avaritia shell, we need to incorporate <cf>special bio-engineering engrams!
The power to be able to <cf>synchronize with avaritia while having a human mind[--].
That's no way......
Yes, ...... it's Master Erinse.
It is a "plan" to make Erinse the head of <cf>Avalitia</cf> in order to control Avalitia!
Huh?　Erlinse is your princess, isn't she? <cf> You can't do that!
Of course, it was rejected. It was also uncertain whether we could <cf> reliably control the avaritia. ......
In the end, we settled for Master Ehrinze jumping <cf> into the past and releasing Avaritia!
Master Bashraal also respected ["][the Princess's] wishes["]. ...... <cf>It certainly wasn't pleasant, but ......
That, I heard, was to get Erinse-sama to release the avaritia and activate the <cf>biological engram, you know.
He said that would increase the rate of fusion with the avaritia shell. <cf> So, all of this is exactly what Bashraal was trying to do.
Such is the case with ......!
So much for the story. <cf>We'd better hurry to the lab before Bashraal does something to us!
I hope the portal on the first floor works. ...... <cf>If not, we'll just have to bet on [a.][le...] ......
It's locked!
I can't go on with this. ......
Then [--]
You're back, Tirith. <cf> Why don't you just live in peace in that time?
That's not possible! <cf>Please give me back Erinse-sama!
[<cf>Are you crazy to sacrifice the princess?
Rather, the sacrifice of one [Koujyo] will save everyone. <cf>Isn't it the duty of the royal family to give themselves up for that?
Even if we can use the shell to control the bloat of other avaritaires<cf>, it will not solve the problem from the root!
A temporary solution doesn't mean anything. We have to <cf>make the very existence of avaritia disappear[--].
......Oh, I see. <cf>I only disclosed that much information to you.
The Beast of [Planet] ......<cf>That is precisely what caused the distortion of Avaritia to grow.
The disaster that destroyed the old civilization? A fairy tale at a time like this?
The Beast of [planet] is real. In an "imaginary world" separated from this world's time.
The defense mechanism of "Planet Regnus" appears <cf>when a highly developed civilization is found to be a threat to the planet.
It is connected to Avaritia through the imaginary world, and <cf>can never be erased.
This Avaritia Shell Project is to control the root cause, the <cf>[Planet Hoshi] beast!
What the ......!
If the plan succeeds, we will not have to abandon our <cf>civilization in fear of the beast, and we will secure the future of our planet!
Our technology also supports the prosperity of Regnus. <cf> It would also be a path of light for all the species living on earth, wouldn't it?
What do you want Tirith?　That's the most important thing.
What does Tirith want?　That's the most important thing.
Seniors ....... <cf>.................. I am ......
I want to help Lady Erinse! <cf>I don't think the path is bright enough to sacrifice someone else!
...... Apparently, it was you who made Tirith stronger.
Let's <cf> hear how you guys procured the chronograms at length later!
You're a Zorkisian fighter. <cf>Well, I have no choice, I'll hold them off here. You guys go on ahead!
But how do you ......
There should be a wall ahead that is being repaired. <cf>I can sneak in to Bashlar from there.
Where I used to go on a rampage. I made a pretty big hole <cf> in it, so it's not fully restored yet.
Now, go on! <cf>You'll get the soldiers coming!
Hrelbe was right. <cf>We can go on now!
Let's go!　Let's go save Erlinse-sama!
(Running) Ha...... ha...... ha...... ha......
(Find Erinse) Ha!
Erlinse-sama!
Ha!　Tiris stop!
(Called out, turning around) Ha!
(Blown away - on his buttocks) Whoa! ......
(Looking at the enemy) Damn!
Do it!
(Running - stop and be surprised) Ha ha ha ......
(Running - stop and be surprised and almost fall down) <cf> hahaha...... wow!
Erinse-sama!
(begins to remove the tentacles entangled in Erinse) Ugh......
(Continues to remove the tentacles entangled in Erinse.) Gghh............
(Surprise)!
(Continues to remove the tentacles entangled in Erinse.) GGG......
(pulls Erinse away from tentacles)
(Tentacle grabs her)
Tirisu!
It's an anomaly. It's going out of control, pull it off!
(startled) Ha......!
(Running - blown away) <cf> ha...... ha...... ha...... oh my god!
(Trying to dislodge the tentacles that wrap around you) <cf>U......U......KU......
Tirith......?
Erinse-sama...... run......
(Running - jumping) <cf>Ha...... hah...... hah...... guh--!
(Reach out your hand) Huh......!
(run - jump)<cf> ahead...... seniors......
(Sucked into avaricious shell)<cf>ah...... ah......
(withstands roar and impact)<cf>Ugh......! --!
(withstands roar and impact)<cf>Kuh......Kuh......
(withstand the roar and the shock) <cf>Ha...... oh......
Gone ......?
He jumped without a chronogram?
And ...... this is ......
(stands up) Huh ......
When is ...... ......
Oh, hey, take it easy!
Answer me!　Where did that thing that took Tirith in <cf> jump to!
...... The predicted time is 1000 years ago. <cf>That's the time period you jumped!
(Exasperated, he walks away, holding his arm in pain.) <cf>ck......!
(Looks at Erinse.) Ah......
If you are going to help, you might as well give up. <cf>The space-time has been disrupted by Shell's outburst!
To chronoleap now would be suicidal.
You have caused this! <cf>Can't you do something about it!
At ...... unworthy of you!
(suppressing indignation) ......
I can do something about it.
(Turns around) Ah......
You ...... are Merlouf ...... sure? <cf> Why are you here ......
Thanks for remembering my name.
Are you ...... a wanderer?
You are indeed a Zorkisian executive. <cf>You know me?
Then [--]it's in your best interest to cooperate, right?
Hey, kid!　Don't just show up out of the blue and let me show you the way, <cf>and then proceed on your own!
Erlinse-sama, be safe!
What's up?　Where's Tillis?
Tirith took ...... my place ......
You did it, didn't you? <cf> I can't believe they made a puppet like that and connected it to the beast.
The thing's outburst has even activated the beast. <cf>At this rate, civilization on this planet will perish in the near future.
The act of creating the future will destroy the future. <cf> Truly, man is a fool.
But [--]still, I have to save you guys.
We're going to the Chronogate. <cf> I'll make it so I can jump.
Huh?　What are you--
Trust me. <cf>Of course, you'll help me, won't you, Uncle?
...... I have no choice.
Well, and, uh...
You guys stay here. <cf>I need your help with something.
...... will buy you some time.
Now go. We're running out of time.
Time and space are stable ......?
See, we managed it, didn't we?
Avaritia shell, was it? <cf> I'll be 'out' at the prediction point soon.
You can look for me when you go back in time. <cf>Maybe you know where the Shell appears.
I'd be in <cf>Asterlys in that time period.
*sound split* <cf>I'll be in Asterlys.
Who the hell are you, you? <cf> Are you of the Buffalian Gods, too?
My name is Merlouf. I'm just a wanderer.
Look, there's no time to get lost.
Quickly, while space-time is stable.
(eye contact with Erlinse) ......
Please use this chronogram. <cf> I'll give you a new omnistron as well.
Bashlar: ......
<cf>Our goals are aligned in terms of capturing Avalitya Shell. There is no need for us to fight.
We will support you as much as we can in the future!
......You are always right. <cf>Even your choice to work with us now is so.
Even I know what is best. <cf>You were my mentor, even if only temporarily. But ......
I will join hands with you.
But <cf>I will never forgive you for putting Tirith in harm's way.
......That is why you are the proud [princess] of Buffalia!
You will stay here and watch over the Bashraals.
Ha!　Please be careful.
Let's go back. Back to your time.
Bastards of Hope. Show me your fight.
(Responding to Merlouf's words) ......
I see you have returned.
Huh,...... I'm kind of tired all at once,......
Are you sure you want to ......? <cf>If you continue to cooperate with us......
You guys just got caught up in ......
Tillis is one of us.
Tirith is one of us.
Thank you ...... for your help ......!
Okay, I'm off to find Merlouf as soon as I can. <cf> Meet me at the pioneer station in Asterlys.
Is it the same as usual ......? <cf>It's like we've gone to the future. ......
<cf>Would you like to drop by the Coin Pavilion? <cf> I'd like to say hello to your husband.
I'm warning you, it's not because I want to eat or anything like that.　It's also to gather information!
(Embarrassed by my stomach growling)
(Embarrassed by his stomach growling.) All right, then. I'll leave the rest to you.
What, you're going out?
Yeah, I'm just heading out. ......
Sir, the ingredients are ready.
Well then, you can spend the rest as you like. <cf> Oh, and make sure you pay Jake for what you spent.
What's keeping you busy?
It's been like that for a while now. <cf>I've been in and out of the store ......
Today, he finally said he's going to close the store.
What?　Close this place? <cf> Why so suddenly?
Don't worry. <cf>We've agreed that I'll take care of that matter. This is a place of rest and relaxation for adventurers.
However,<cf>I hope you're not involved in anything strange,<cf>Dad,<cf>......
...... I don't think so, but <cf>I hope you're not affected by our visit to the future. ......?
Hey, anything else unusual? <cf>Anything. Even if it's a small thing.
Why? Uhhhh... ...... yeah... ......... <cf>Oh, yes. Did you hear about the assassins of Prince Kings?
The assassins of the Prince? <cf> Lord King of Barnhardt is on medical leave, is he not?
Oh, come on, when did you hear that? <cf> The Duke was assassinated during the attack on the principality by the dragon clans.
And the main culprit, Carveen, a member of the Order, is hiding out in Asterlys, and there's a lot of commotion.
Carveen assassinated the Duke!
Oh?　Oh. Haven't you seen the handbill? <cf> He's a pretty big bounty hunter, isn't he?
What do you mean ......? When we were there, <cf> the king wasn't assassinated. ......?
[Wait a minute. Wait a minute, there's a guest. <cf> Sorry, my husband is out of town.
...... You don't think history has changed ......?
I don't think Carveen is the kind of guy who would <cf>assassassinate</cf> the king. ......
He didn't seem that smart to me! <cf>I think Yoruk would be more likely to do it.
......Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Avaritia Shell <cf>jumped this way......
Let's hurry up and find Merlouf. <cf>If you're looking for someone, the best place to ask is at the settlement office.
I'm going to ask a few questions. I'm looking for someone. ......
Hmm?　Are you also looking for the assassin of the Prince?
There are a lot of them these days. Well, I hear there's quite a bounty on your head, and I'm sure adventurers would be interested.
No, we're not looking for Carveen, but for a man named Merlouf.
<cf>Merlouf</cf> is a rather eccentric-looking boy. <He must be somewhere in Asterlys.
Mr. Merlouf, is that you? ...... I'll look into it.
Hmmm............no one comes to mind. <cf>I don't think he's been to the pioneer station.
Hmmm. <cf>Anything about seeing him anywhere?
Yes, I have. <cf>The guards at the town gate plaza might have an idea.
<cf>We've been patrolling the area and increasing security because the assassins may be holed up there.
They're checking people in and out, and even the <cf>Knights of Barnhart</cf> have joined the patrols.
It seems to be a direct order from Knight Commander Dunkerque. <cf>It's like they're staring at us, and it's hard to do.
Dunkerque also has Carvain at ....... <cf>Is it still true that the duke is assassinated ......?
[--]No, there's nothing we can do about it now. <cf>More importantly, Merlouf and Avaritia Shell.
Let's go to the town gate square. <cf>Ask the gatekeeper if he knows anything about this.
Sorry to bother you. <cf>I'm looking for a man named Merlouf.
He's a rather odd looking boy, <cf>what can I say, he's a bit of an eccentric ......
......
Hmmm, I haven't seen him around here.
Any idea what he might be like in the Order?
Hmmm... ....... I may have seen him on my rounds. <cf> He seemed like a somewhat out-of-this-world boy.
Oh, that could be him!　Where could he be?
In the arena. I tried to talk to him, but he was talking in a roundabout way that I couldn't understand.
Well, I decided it was harmless. ......
I ask in case you are wondering, this Merlouf guy. <cf> You're not related to the assassin of the Prince, are you?
Of course not. If he were, he wouldn't be asking for his whereabouts right in front of you.
I see that too. ...... My apologies. <cf>We ask for your understanding because of the circumstances.
<cf>You are very tense. <cf>I still cannot believe in the assassination of the Prince.
But it is a fact. The Guard and the Pioneer Bureau have received a request for cooperation from the Order of the Knights.
I hope they find the assassin soon and things calm down.
I know, right ....... <cf>Thanks for the interruption. Thank you for letting me know.
Now, let's look around the arena!
Hey, long time no see. <cf>...... you seem to have grown since the last time I was here.
After all, <cf>you're more efficient ...... than the people here?
You're still talking nonsense. <cf>Now we'll let you listen to us.
Tell us. Where is the Avaritia Shell?
You told me a thousand years from now. He said he would know where <cf>Avalitya Shell was!
1000 years later I ...... Oh, yes, I see. ...... <cf>Then that was the reaction you got.
Did you guys make that ...... thing?
Huh?　You've got to be kidding me!　If I had the technology to make something like that, I would have used it to make money first!
Yeah, well, yeah. <cf>You guys are like that.
I liked ....... <cf>The creators of that stuff are not you guys.
If they had been,[--]<cf>I would have killed them without even using them.
The fact that I got advice from a thousand years later means that <cf>I'm here to do something about that thing......
Then there is no reason for me to refuse to cooperate now. <cf>If we don't do something about that thing, civilization will die.
Tell us about ....... <cf>Where is the Avaritia shell?
It was about 6 months ago. An anomalous outbreak of engrams was seen <cf>underground on "St. Bafaria Island".
Maybe that's where you guys are looking for it.
Avaritia Shell crossed <cf> time and space without using a chronogram. That's why the coordinates were shifted!
So history has changed in those six months. ......
Let's head to the basement of St. Bafaria. We need to check the status of the <cf>avaritia shell as soon as possible!
If you want to go to the basement of St. Bapharia, ......, you can go from the temple of Asterlys.
<cf>The Cathedral of the Blessed is the home of the Buffalians. <cf> They probably have at least a transporter there.
I forget how many times I've asked. <cf>Who the hell are you?
You don't even look surprised when I ask you who you are from the future. <cf>A thousand years from now, he will still look the same: ......
<cf>And he also seems to have some hidden meaning as to his true identity. Can't you just tell us what's going on?
What's the matter? There's nothing here.
<span size="Big">He got away! </>
Oh, oh, I <cf>hate</cf> myself for falling for such a childish trick!　I'm filled with rage that I can't do anything about!
Please calm down. Anyway, let's use the <cf>Temple of Asterlys</cf> as we were taught!
Hmmm...yes. But ...... will they really let us use it <cf> so easily?
You said that we can use the transporter in this temple to go to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings".
Yes......Yes,......<cf>That's where Avaritia Shell......<cf>No, Tirith is there!
Well,......<cf>I'll have to use the transporter first.
Let's go talk to the most important guy.
......I see. That matches the figure that Einlein-sama <cf> mentioned.
I am Lugerio, Chief Priest of Asterlys. <cf> By oracle, I obey you.
Come, this way. <cf> I will guide you to the Cathedral of the Blessed One.
By the oracle, the Order will follow us ......?
Yes. If that is the revelation received by the priestess of the oracle.
The God of Buffalia needs your help now. <cf> We only obey the word of God!
The god of Buffalia is ......?　Perhaps ......
For more information, please ask <cf>Master Einlein, who is in the cathedral
Let's go to ......
Is this ward working on ...... the bio-engraum ......?
I've been waiting for you ......
Just to be sure, do you remember us?
About the [raija] ......, or the permit to enter the [mihashira] of the <cf>[kamigakari] ......... ...
This area seems to have not changed at all.
By the way, why do you put this kind of warding at ......?
This is to put <cf>God's messenger</cf> to sleep inside ......
Could it be that the Avaritia Shell is inside of this!
Avaritia Shell ......?
Oh, no, how long has this [MITSUKA] cousin been here?
Six months ago suddenly here ....... <cf>I have to ward it, or it will happen. ......
No, it's dangerous!
Please don't stop!　I have to see it with my own eyes!
Inside, there is a monster.
(Noticing) ......
It's blocking us from approaching the [mitsuka]!
Because of this, we can only ward them from here!
If this continues, God's [messenger] will eventually wake up and ......
God wants your strength.
God wants to remove the monster within and subdue the wrath of the <cf>[messenger].
To those who have accomplished that, pledge allegiance to ...... and ......
......Bashraal. <cf>This oracle is probably what he ......
So that's what you're saying. ......
Alright. Let's knock out that monster or whatever it is inside and save Tirith.
I guess there's a [mitsuka]i......<cf> avaritia shell in the back here.
I hope Tirith is safe. ......
Hmm ......?
Looks like a dead end......
Maybe this is it......
Whew ......!　What?
(startled - turns around)
That's him! <cf> The monster Einlein was talking about!
It's ...... again!
May I? ......?
Oh, no, that's too much trouble. Servant, let's do it again!
That one is ......! <cf> Avaritia Shell!
(Noticing the enemy's attack, he avoids it.) Ha......!
What the hell is this thing? <cf>They're clearly different from the ones we just saw!
Don't tell me it's ...... for ...... against dragon tribes? <cf>Even this thing ......!
O God of Buffalia, show us your power!
Now you can ...... be safe for a while......
That is indeed God's chosen one. <cf>How could you defeat that monster......
(I noticed) ......
On behalf of the oracle priestess, I thank you.
At that rate, it was only a matter of time <cf> before the [mitsuka]ika would have gone on the rampage. The gods must be very pleased.
But that is only temporary. <cf>It seems to be sleeping now, but[--].
Eventually it will wake up and ......<cf>take Tirith in completely......
We need to find a way to separate them somehow......
Hey ...... if you don't<cr>
If there is no way to do that......
The <cf> world will be ...... by the avaricious shell that has taken in Tirith
What will you do then, my dear ......?
You can enter the Room of Ritual from here.
Do you want to go to the Room of Ceremonies?
You can return to the Room of Purification here.
Would you like to return to the Room of Purification?
Oh, you guys can go to ....... <cf>Mr. Lugerio has told us about you.
Come, this way. <cf>I will take you to the Seido of the Blessed One.
<cf> Should Einlein continue to hold the wards here?
The rest of the congregation is only an aid. <cf> This is a ward that only a priestess of the oracle can create!
If Einlein-sama were to leave this place, <cf> the wards would begin to break down, and it would not be long before they would collapse.
If that is the case, we can't just keep going on like this <cf> forever.
We need to find a way to separate <cf>Tirith</cf> from the avaritia shell as soon as possible. ......
(Notices communication) Oh, ......
I will leave you now. I am usually at the <cf>Temple of Asterlys, at your service.
(Looking at Lugerio as he leaves) Hmmm...
It would be troublesome if they ask me. <cf> Let's talk over there.
[--]This is Bashlar. <cf>Master Erinse, please respond if you can.
Erlinse. <cf>How are things going over there?
<cf> Since Erinse's chrono-leap, space-time has begun to be disturbed once again.
At present, it is impossible for us to send reinforcements.
Therefore, we have received an oracle from the divine race of that time period. <cf>For the time being, please use the cult as your base.
As for Vordigen, we are <cf>following their movements. We will contact you if there is any movement.
So now the common enemy is the dragon tribe ......? <cf>Until we help Tirith, that is.
Now that you understand, I would like to ask you to release <cf>Abaritia</cf>, Mr. Erinse.
(Surprise!) ......
It must be the effect of the Shell jumping over there. There must be some <cf> extreme outlier avaritia in that period.
We are <cf> more bloated than before in this era due to past changes. Please release them before they become an obstacle.
...... Bashlar? <cf>You, do you still have memories from before the historical change?
Unless you were the party who did the chronoleaping, you <cf>shouldn't be able to recognize the effects of the altered history. ......
[--]I don't have time for unnecessary chit-chat. <cf>If you want to save the planet, act quickly.
What do you suggest we do?　Do we go and liberate <cf>Avaritia</cf> as Bashraal said?
That's the only way now.
That's the only way now, I suppose.
Ehrinze. Do you know where Abaritia is?
Uh, yes.
...... here!　There's a reaction near <cf> "The Watering Place of the Sublunar Dragon" in the Montenol Valley.
Oh, ......?　Omnistron has been contacted.
...... from Bashlar?
＜As part of a cooperative effort, I'm sending you information on the following.
<cf> the cause of the avaritia bloat.
<cf> The bloat of Avalitha is being caused by the influence of the "Beasts of the Planet" in the imaginary world.
＜As you know, avaritia is created by <cf>'self-killers' who have undergone a chronoleap.
＜They are distortions, disconnected from time.
＜Because of this, Avaritia is connected to the <cf> imaginary world, which has no concept of time.
<cf>The beast of the planet is steadily awakening. <cf>As a result, the distortion of Avalithia grows.
＜"until it will eventually engulf the world.
<cf>There are two ways to end the situation. <cf>One is to abandon civilization and stop the awakening of the beast.
＜The other is to control the beast itself.
<cf> Which is more beneficial to mankind? <cf> I hope you will consider this once again. That is all.
You are still talking so glibly.
But I see that you have not changed your mind about the beast on the planet.
I understand Bashraal's concern. <cf>The liberation of Avaritia will eventually lead to the abandonment of civilization.
I'm sure that was the plan to avoid that, but ......
What is really the right path? I think we <cf>have to keep thinking about it!
I release this avaritia!
Let us begin the ...... ceremony of liberating the avalitaire!
So now we have 5 liberated avalitias. <cf>I hope this has a positive impact on the future.
No, you can't even say it's a good influence ......? <cf>It's a valuable resource for you guys.
Yes. ...... That's why Bashraal was <cf>against</cf> liberating Avaritia......
And yet you let them liberate Avaritia, <cf>isn't the future situation not much better......?
......Ah......
Oops, no. I have to give Erinse a break. <cf>Somewhere ...... I guess so. Let's go to Litze.
We can have a good rest here.
Thank you very much. But first, I will contact <cf>Bashraal.
This is Erlinse. Can you hear me?
...... confirms normal reception. This is Bashraal. <cf> By the looks of it, did you successfully liberate Avaritia?
Yes, we just released the one you specified.
...... I see. The response is indeed gone. <cf>There is now one immediate threat gone.
Now, let me report the current status. <cf>The future is no longer observable from our time
What ......?　Well, what kind of ...... is that?
It means that we are in a situation where we could perish at any moment. ......<cf>
...... because of the fusion of Avaritia Shell with <cf> Tirith. ......
Na, then go back to the past! If we can stop <cf> the fusion of Tirith and Shell,......
I told you. Space-time is not stable. <cf>And [--]that much is already in practice!
Practice ......?
...... You don't mean to tell me that you chrono-leap in a disrupted space-time?
Several people were sacrificed, <cf>without the desired results!
--!　Why such a reckless thing?
We cannot afford to be concerned about human life when we are faced with the survival of our planet. Except your life, Mr. Ehrinse.
Bashlar ......!
Master Erlinse, in your time, please think only of <cf>separating Tirith from the shell!
......, O unnamed collaborator. <cf>Protect Master Erinse to the death!
You don't need to be told. <cf> But I will not let you take Erinse.
<cf> But I will not give Eälinse to you. <cf> But I will not give Eälinsee to you.
Hoof ......
<cf>You don't have to apologize. <cf>Now, we will do what we can!
[<cf>Let's go back to the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings. <cf>We can't put Tirith and the future at risk anymore ......!
How is Tirith?
She's fine...... now she's sleeping......
......How did the defeat of Avaritia go?
How did you know that? <cf> You didn't hear me!
No, I did not. The oracle ....... <cf> ["]I shall cooperate with you now more than ever."], and...
Ah, oh, I see. I see. ....... <cf>An oracle is convenient.
...... Now, I don't have the information you guys need. <cf>No, but ......
...... if you don't mind. <cf>I'd like you to go check on Carveen and Charlotte.
Carveine, huh? Oh, by the way, you're wanted <cf> for the assassination of the Lord King. ......
I haven't heard from him since we parted in Khartoum.
He didn't assassinate the high king. <cf>But ...... the world doesn't think so,......
I get it. I'll take care of it.
I'm on it. You got it.
Thank you. ......
Carveen and Charlotte's hideout is <cf> near the Khartoum Ruins: ......
A place called "The Sandstone Corridor of Khartoum." <cf>But the road is dangerous ......
<cf>Well, with me and my servant, there's nothing to be afraid of! <cf>I'll make sure to see them both in good health!
This is where we are. <cf>The Carveenes' hideout is
Come to think of it, Mr. Carveen was hiding from the <cf>Barnhardt Knights</cf> in the previous history, wasn't he?
Mm. At that time, he was snooping around <cf> in collusion with Jorg</cf>. ......
<cf>This time it's the "assassins of the Prince", you see. <cf>The Knights must be looking at you in a different light.
<cf>Well, don't look so serious. <cf>No news is good news, as they say.
Now, I believe you said, <cf>"The Sandstone Corridor of Khartoum.
<cf> They may be bored, too. <cf> Let's show them some face after all these years.
I'm sure Mr. Carveen and Charlotte are hiding in the back here.
Let's make sure they're safe.
(notice) ......!
（......!)
（Oh!
Oh, man, you struck out! <cf> Where the hell did that Carveen guy go?
I'm going after him. <cf> He's got a woman with him. He can't get far.
Damn it! <cf> We should've played with the cultists from the start.
We could've gone on a rampage over there. <cf> You made me have to go through all this trouble!　...... hmm?
Hey!　Hey, you guys sneaking around over there! <cf> Come out for a minute!
(Surprised that the enemy knows)!
(Surprised that the enemy knows) Ah!
(Surprised that the enemy has found out.) Ah!
<cf>Sir, can't we avoid a battle? <cf>Servant, beat these people to death!
I see they've fled. ...... <cf> Good grief. The Order of Barnhart has fallen.
Those people came to capture Mr. Carveen, didn't they? <cf>But ......
Neither Carveen nor Charlotte <cf>were in sight. Where in the world are they ......
I'm also concerned about their whereabouts. ......<cf>Didn't the guys from the Order say something strange?
[I should have played with the Order guys, so I could have <cf>freely riot[/cf>]......
...... That's kind of a disgusting turn of phrase. <cf>What happened between the Order and the Knights?
Mm....... Anyway, we must report to Einlein<cf>At any rate, let's go back to Asterlys!
Hmm? <cf>......Something seems to be wrong with the town, doesn't it?
If you ask me, it seems to be a bit more noisy than usual. ......? <cf>Let's hear what everyone has to say.
I heard there was an incident at the temple!
I don't know the details either, but <cf>I do know that there were several injured guards!
I wonder if the rumor is true that the oracle priestess and the wanted criminal were <cf> meeting in secret?
If that's true, is that story true too?
If you don't want to get yourself in danger, <cf>you'd better stay away from the temple now.
Of course I wouldn't go near it. <cf>I don't want to be an enemy of the principality. ......
Hmmm, something has happened in the temple. <cf>Okay, let's go talk to Lugerio.
<cf>Block the way out of the [temple] of the [blessing]. <cf> Do not let anyone from the principality come this way.
Also, hurry and send messengers to Ralpal and Salamzat to <cf>require reinforcements</cf>!
What's going on? <cf>It doesn't look like anything out of the ordinary. ......
It is an emergency. The Duchy of Barnhart has <cf>declared war against the Order!
Moreover, the oracle priestess ......<cf> Lady Einlein has been taken away!
How can that be? <cf>What happened while we were gone!
It was too sudden. The Duchy of Barnhart has declared us to be a heretical religion that makes use of Avaritia!
Moreover, they even called us a dangerous group that manipulated the assassination of Duke Norbert and tried to <cf>take over the Duchy</cf>. ......
Master Einlein was <cf>forcibly captured</cf> for leading the assassins of the Duke. In doing so, he was also responsible for the deaths of several people.
Terrible......
Wait. If Einlein was taken away, <cf>what about the warding of the cathedral!
The few remaining members of the congregation are holed up and maintaining it. <cf>But ......
Without Einlein-sama, the wards will eventually collapse and <cf>[Mitsuka]ikai will wake up ......
Tirith ......!
Let's hurry to the cathedral!
It is currently on lockdown. There is a possibility that the Knights of the <cf>Duchy</cf> will ride in here from the cathedral.
We are no longer in contact with the Diocese of Barnhart. <cf>We cannot afford to lose the Temple of Asterlys on top of this. ......
So the Order has no way to do anything about it. ......
If this continues, Tirith will be ...... and the world will be ....... <cf>What in the world can we do? ......
<cf>The Faith of Buffalia can't face the Duchy of Barnhart face to face.
If they do, it will be war. <cf>But if we negotiate too long, our wards will not hold.
If that is the case, there is only one way left: ....... <cf>We, who have nothing to do with this, will have to act on our own.
Let's go help Einlein. <cf>There is no time to lose!
Let's go save Einlein. <cf>There is no time to be lost!
We've taken on the oracle's priestess, and we're going to use force against her. <cf>We can't afford to dawdle. We must leave at once.
We'll need a ship to sneak in. <cf>A ship that will carry us regardless of the cult: ......
<cf>If you're going to talk like this, Jake is the one to talk to! <cf>He's got a big mouth. I'm sure he knows who owns the ship.
<cf>Erinze, you are still recovering from your illness. <cf> You may take shelter in the temple.
I will see to it that he is well. <cf>I am not comfortable with a servant alone.
...... understands. Please be safe.
I'm off to see Jake. He should be at the Coin Pavilion, <cf>keeping an eye on his master's absence.
Please!　I was told by <cf>Murie that you can handle this!
Charlotte ......?　Why are you here!
You guys ......! <cf> That's our line. Why are you here!
Where's Carveen?　Isn't he with you?
Hey, wait a minute. <cf>Carveen means ...... that Lord King assassin!
Carveen didn't assassinate anyone!
He was framed!　So is Einlein! <cf>Both of them have done nothing wrong!
<cf>Well, calm down. We <cf>know</cf> he's not a bad guy. What the hell is going on here?
...... Carveen found out about the Order's plan to attack the Order and rode alone into the Principality to help <cf>Einlein</cf>.
Even though he himself was being chased by the Duchy,...... <cf>They told me that I was ["]dangerous and that they should hide me in the temple["].
But I don't want to do that!　They are both my benefactors. <cf>I want to help you too. So [--]]
...... is that why you're looking for a ship? <cf> To go to the Principality and help them?
......Well, you're in for a treat. <cf>With such sincere eyes, how can I refuse?
OK, I'll lend a hand. <cf>I'll go with you. <cf>I can't put Lady in harm's way alone.
It's not in my nature to judge people based on rumors. <cf>We'll see with our own eyes if this Carveen is a good guy or a bad guy.
Thanks ......!　Thanks, Jake!
By the way, Jake. By the way, Jake, do you have room for a couple more people on the boat you're renting?
Oh, you too. ...... assassin and oracle priestess. <cf> This one seems more complicated than I thought.
All right, I'll talk to the captain I know. <cf>Come to the harbor when you're ready.
The reward seems to be ....... <cf>You can tell my beloved Murie about my saga.
Ok. I'll let her know that my heart has moved on to a new woman.
No, sure, Miss Charlotte is lovely, but <cf>I'm all about her!　Don't be like that!
Oh, you thought she was cute?
Bacca, don't do that!　Don't say that! <cf> Don't ever say that!
Yes! I've spoken to the captain. <cf> Let's take this boat to Barnhart!
No, wait. This is a trading ship, right? <cf> Are you going to sail into the port of Barnhart with impunity?
No way. We'll sneak off on the way. <cf>There's a fishing village called Canaroa near the castle. There.
Oh, I see. That's a good idea! <cf>Top of the line sign is not a joke.
...... but where are the sailors? <cf>I can't seem to find them: ......
That's the problem. <cf>We got the captain, but we can't get the crew.
These are the times we live in, right?　<cf>Who would go all the way to Barnhart when the liners are stopped?
Either you're a fool, or you're a fierce ......
Okay, I get it. We'll take care of the sailors. <cf>You and Charlotte get ready to sail.
OK! But, do you have a crew in mind?
I can't think of any right off the top of my head, but I'm sure many of them have lost their jobs because they couldn't get out to sea.
My servant, I'll run around the city and find someone for you.
I don't care what their circumstances or backgrounds are. <cf>Anyway, you must gather a crew of sailors!
<cf>The men in the harbor have all gone ashore in fear of the Duke of Barnhart's blockade of the seas!
<cf>Thanks to them, I can't do my job either. <cf>Truly, I'm not going to go to sea for fear of soldiers and knights!
You talk like that...... are you a sailor?
I'm a ship's engineer. I am a ship's engineer.
There's no engine, no matter how shabby or how much of a horse it is, that I can't train.
<cf>I'll take you anywhere you want to go, as long as you get on the boat. <cf>As long as you get out.
Like ...... the Duchy of Barnhardt, for example?
...... didn't you listen to me? <cf>Barnhardt is the one who stopped the liner.
What the hell were you thinking, ignoring that and getting on board? ......<cf> I love it, you guys!
I like you guys! <cf>I want to go to sea with a man with a backbone like this!
Take me for a ride! <cf>You can all take care of the engines!
<cf>I'm trying to get out of Barnhart's sea blockade, aren't I? <cf>Who else but me can run the engines?
<cf>A ship's engine can only be handled by an expert.
<cf>You may have found something you didn't expect. <cf>All right, keep up the good work and gather the rest of the crew.
We may have picked up something we didn't expect.
<cf>Now, if that's all we got, we're good to go. <cf> Let's get back to Jake.
Oh, ......, we're screwed!
I can't believe they even shut down the liner service. ...... <cf>Mom and Dad, I hope they're ok.
<cf>Are you not a sailor? <cf>You seem very depressed.
<cf>You mean to tell me that you lost your job because the liner service stopped?
Yes, that's right. <cf>I'm having a hard time not having a job.
I have a family home in Barnhart. <cf>My mother and sister live over there.
My mom is old and my sister is frail. <cf>So I used to check on them every time I went to work.
<cf>I can't do that anymore. <cf>I don't know what's going on in the principality, and I'm just worried about her. ......
Hmmm.......... Just a hypothetical. <cf>What would you do if I told Barnhart that I was going to send a ship out?
I would appreciate it if you could help me with the ship. <cf> And while you're at it, you might want to visit your parents' house.
What?　Are you serious? <cf> That means you're ...... stowing away, right?
Well, it's hard to say out loud. <cf> We have some business with Barnhart.
<cf>We don't know when we'll be able to go there if we keep waiting.
That's right. ...... <cf>It would suck to not be able to see my family.
I'm not sure what to do. ...... Okay, I'll take you up on it. <cf>Can I come on board with you?
I'm still worried about my family and how important they are. <cf>I'm willing to take the risk to go see them!
That's the spirit. <cf> You can rest assured. <cf>I will make sure you are not to blame.
I hope you find your family safely.
Now, let's find the rest of the crew!
Hmmm... <cf>It would be a lot easier to get over there if we had someone who knew the area around Kanaloa.
...... what?　Go to Kanaroa: ......?
Oh, wait!　Wait! <cf> Is that true?　You guys are taking the boat out!
Ummm. It would be great if we could get some locals to show us the way.
Leave it to me!　I'll show you the way as much as I can! <cf> I will do whatever it takes to get back home!
Oh, God of Buffalia!　I thank you! <cf> Finally, we're getting out of this dead end!
I don't know what it is, but I guess I'm helping people. <cf> Well, well. Let's keep it up and get some sailors.
I don't know what it is, but it looks like we're helping people!
The ship is ready. What about you?
Ready to go to the Duchy of Barnhart?
Ready.
Yeah, we're all set.
Yeah, I'm all set.
All right, let's go!
Just a little more.
Hold on a little longer.
Hold on a little longer.
Okay, I'm on it. Come on, come on.
Come on, let's get underway! <cf> Once you go out to sea, you can't go back so easily!
Don't worry! Master Jake here is with me. <cf>Look like you're on a big ship and leave it to me!
Carveine, Einlein. Wait for me. <cf>I'll save you, I promise.
<cf>They are the strongest elite knights who were once known as the "Shield of Buffalia". Are you ready for this?
Let's go to the Duchy of Barnhart!
Come on!　Get in!
Gghh!
Carveine!
Damn it! ......
I and Einlein are innocent.
We did not assassinate His Majesty Norbert. <cf> Believe me!
......[your]You should resent your origins!
Your executions will coincide with the Duke's state funeral.
I'm sorry, but this is also my duty.
Commander of the Order!　Master Hugo!
How about at least Einlein [--]!
(frustrated) Damn it! ............
...... Carveine
Don't ...... tell me you're only helping me. ......
I'm sorry, I ......<cf> swore to protect you, even to Yorke. ......
Mr. Dunkirk......Why......
Now, from this day forward, you <cf>are</cf> a member of the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart.
I am sure you will be a good knight. Together with <cf> Jorg, you will be the foundation of the Duchy.
We are counting on you, my sons.
Yoruk ...... what am I to do ......?
The Duchy of Barnhart extends from east to west across the capital. And that is the West Barnhart Peninsula.
It is close to the capital and can be accessed from the sea, right? <cf>Since the olden days, dragon tribes have come here and fought.
<cf>It's an old battlefield, so to speak, that marks the history of warfare in the principality. <cf> Though our steps may be small, in the history of the world, they are great [--].
Hey! We're about to arrive. <cf> Let's get to the boat.
(Looking toward the land) Oh~!
You've arrived safely? <cf> What a hodgepodge of sailors you've managed to pull off.
Ah!　That one!
(Noticing) Hmm.
Execution on the occasion of the King's state funeral. ......? <cf>It's like they're making an example out of us.
We have to help him quickly!　Let's go to Barnhart Castle!
What are you going to do? We're up against the brave and audible <cf> Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart.
Fortunately, there are still days left before the state funeral. <cf>First, let us assess the situation and formulate a plan.
We must split up and gather information. <cf>After that, we will meet at the entrance to the town. All right?
Still, a public execution doesn't sound very peaceful.
My husband says it's our duty as citizens to watch, but he's just an onlooker.
What?　How do we get to the castle?
What do you want at the castle?　<cf> If it's an execution, it's in the royal square, isn't it?
<cf> You don't go there for no reason at a time like this. <cf>You'll get caught and be suspicious.
...... want to go into Barnhart Castle?
Are you adventurers or ......
Then you can't. <cf>I'm told they're restricting entry and exit now. ......
Well,...... the only people who can get in are merchants with <cf>special permission,......
...... Well, there was a peddler at the pier that I haven't seen.
Huh ....... <cf> Oh, man. ......
What's up with that? <cf>...... they cut a deal with the castle.
What? ......?　<cf>Oh, I won't be going to the castle for a while......
......, why do you ask that?
...... you guys are on some kind of a roll, aren't you? <cf> I'm telling you, it's better for yourselves if you don't think about anything strange right now.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that. <cf> See ya!
(No choice, let's try ...... else. ......)
(surprise)?
You can change the future.
Oh, my servant!　We're in trouble!
Help Carveen and Einlein. <cf> Please, please take care of those two ......
Was that ......?
What's wrong?　You're spaced out. What's wrong?
Oh, well, that's all right. I'll take care of this first. Here.
I couldn't believe my eyes either. <cf>...... shows how to get into Barnhart Castle.
The sender is the owner of the Coin Pavilion. <cf>An adventurer brought it to me a while ago.
......Who is that man, the owner of the pavilion? <cf>What on earth is he doing without telling me?
<cf>We can't let this information slip through our fingers. <cf>We should all meet up and have a strategy meeting!
Let's meet up with Jake and Charlotte and see what the letter says!
...... To get into Barnhart Castle, <cf>we can use the closed "Old Underground Canal".
But to get in, you need a "key", <cf>which is hidden in the "Alston Abandoned Mine" ......
Yes, that's correct. <cf> Assuming the contents of the letter are correct.
There seems to be no other way. <cf>We'll just have to trust your father here, won't we?
The problem is that the soldiers won't find us. <cf>The people in town say that the patrols have increased dramatically.
Well, he's actually here as a stowaway. <cf> If they find us, it will be difficult to get off peacefully.
I'm prepared to take some chances, but I don't want to make a scene. <cf> Let's try to sneak up on them and move forward as stealthily as possible.
Now then, everyone, our goal is the "Alston Abandoned Mine"!
Stop! <cf> Are you adventurers?　Where did you come from?
Let's see who you are. <cf> Remove everything you have and everything you are wearing!
(There are only two of them. I'll draw them out, so you and Jake can knock them out.)
(Surprise!
Dragon people!　Seriously at a time like this?
Identification?　What a hassle!
This is why humans are so ......
Re ...... Mr. Leanbrum! <cf>But to protect public safety in the current situation [--].
No talking. <cf>All you have to do is punish all suspicious people: ......
I will allow it on behalf of Dunkirk. <cf> Do it. All of them.
[--]Kill them all.
...... We are the proud Knights of the Duchy of Barnhart. <cf> We cannot take life without probable cause.
Oh, really?　I see, that is a noble mindset!
[--]But the pride of the lowly is no better than feeding livestock. <cf>Too much trouble!
Die, all of you!
(bracing himself against the wind pressure, he stands alert and ready)!
Oh no!　Run away!
Did you escape ......?　Or are you dead?
I would have enjoyed it a little more if he had begged for his life in an ugly way.
...... I never thought I'd see a dragon tribe in a place like this.
And to even mention the name Dunkirk!
It was like the Knights were following the dragon tribe!
That's right!　We have to help them ......!
Stop, Miss Charlotte. <cf>It was poison he spit out.
Those two are ...... already dead.
......The key is just down the road. <cf>We can't let the poison get us here. We've got to move on.
(nods) Yes.
According to the letter, <cf>"Alston Abandoned Mine" can be entered through this star vein hole.
OK! So there's a key in the back of it.
It's just an ordinary mining site.
If you're going to hide something, a place like this is better.
I see. Let's go!
There should be a key in the back there! <cf>First, let's get rid of the distractions!
<cf>The key is safely in hand. <cf>Now it's time to enter the castle through the underground canal.
......I have an idea. <cf>From here, let's split up into two groups for diversion and rescue!
The Knights of Barnhart are quite alert. <cf>The inside of the castle will be under much tighter security.
If we all go in like this, we might get <cf>taken out in one fell swoop. We don't want to do that.
I see. That's why we need a diversion to attract the soldiers' attention.
Me and Jake will be in charge of the diversion. <cf>You two help Carveen and Einlein out.
I can handle the running around. Besides, ......<cf>I don't think Jake is cut out for covert action.
I can't hide my overflowing top of the line aura<cf>!　I hate myself for being so public!
I'm so convinced. <cf>Charlotte may have a talent for making a difference.
I believe in you guys. <cf>Please. <cf>Please, make sure you save us both.
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, I got it.
All right, well, we're gonna head to the underground canal.
We'll meet you in Canaloua when it's all over. <cf> Promise!
We're going to the underground canal that was mentioned in the letter. <cf>They say it leads into Barnhart Castle.
Do you have the key?　Then let us be on our way!
<cf> You've been left alone for a long time, I see. <cf>A stranger would not know that such a place exists!
...... There's something in the back. Be on your guard.
If the letter is correct, there should be a prison ahead. <cf>Kick them to the curb, my servant!
The prison is just up ahead. Let's go.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
(Laughing in a burly ver.) Heh heh heh!
Hey, hey!　From where ......
(Grinning) Hmm~
(Noticing - collapsing) Hmm? ...... Wow!
There it is. The keys to the jail.
Let's get you two out of here as soon as possible.
What?
Hold on, I'll open it.
I never thought you would come to my rescue. ...... <cf> I'll be forever in his debt.
You exaggerate.
Well, the gratuity is just a feeling. <cf>In proportion to the size of the feeling.
Speaking of which, what happened to Yoruk? <cf> He didn't seem like the kind of guy who would abandon you guys. ......
(surprise) ......
You know Yoruk?
(Surprise!) Oh?
（What?
I don't know anything about him, you met him at the place where you are also present. <cf>Here, when you borrowed the pendant from Charlotte [--].
...... Yorke was not there at that time. He shouldn't be there.
(Question) Hmm?
Because ...... Yorg is ......
Yoruk died ......2 months ago.
So <cf> he couldn't have met the masters at that time ......
He died ......?
The Knight Commander said that Aberritya had done it to him: ......
......Is this part of the history alteration? ......
Is ...... this part of the history alteration too......
There's a boat leaving for Canaroa on the West Barnhart Peninsula. <cf>Would you like to board?
Do you want to go to the "West Barnhart Peninsula"?
There's a boat going to Asterlys. <cf>Would you like to board?
Do you want to go to the trading city of Asterlys?
I have a lot of questions, but first we need to get out of here. <cf>If anyone finds us, we're finished.
<cf>Wait a minute. Before that, I would like to talk to the Commander of the ...... Knights and <cf>Master Dunkirk</cf>.
What are you talking about? <cf>I would be caught if I did that, of course!
You and Einlein will be executed in time for the state funeral. <cf>Do you not understand that your lives are at stake?
<cf> Running away like this will not solve anything. <cf>This will only lead to needless strife!
<cf>I will talk to Lord Dunkirk and clear myself and Einlein of the suspicion of assassinating the king. That is the only way.
That man also called me 'son'. <cf>[--]Now that Yoruk is gone, I am the only one who can stop my father.
I, too,...... want to know what Dunkirk is thinking.
Let's go to Dunkirk.
What are we going to do if we go alone?
Master. I'm sorry for being so selfish. <cf>Now, let's go to Master Dunkirk.
To get to the Oval Office, we need to go through the courtyard. <cf>Be careful, you'll be easily seen.
(During Jake's diversion) Get that guy!　Whoa!!!!
The intruder is moving north along the castle wall!
（Don't let him get away!
(Jake's diversion) Don't lose him, find him!　Ohh!
(Jake's diversion) That's him, get after him!　Ahhh!
It's the cult!　Send the men around!
(Jake's diversion) Damn, where'd they go?
（Where are the reinforcements?
Not here!　Let's go!
Well, it looks like Jake's diversionary tactics are working.
Master, the Oval Office is not this way! <cf> Let's hurry!
(surprised) Ah!
You're a deadly sinner, Master...
Where do you think you're going?
Deputy Commander ......
Let me speak to Master Dunkirk.
No, I have to talk to him!
I see. Then ......
(Surprise) Ha!
I will cut you down here.
Deputy Commander ......!
You who cooperate with Carveen are equally guilty. <cf>Anyone who casts a shadow on the coming Dunkirk-sama's [MIYO] is [--]!
I, his right hand man, will eliminate them all!
Kuku......!
I'm sorry, Deputy Commander. <cf>I really want to talk to Master Dunkirk!
<cf>Your eyes are straight, with no hesitation. <cf>Master Dunkirk liked that look in your eyes.
<cf>You healed the tremendous heartbreak that Master Dunkirk's death had caused, <cf>even if only a little. ......
Even though I wished and wished, I could not make it happen. ......
And now, of all people, you ......
Why [--]!
Deputy Commander!
Don't touch me!
Don't [touch] me ......<cf> with your hands that flow abominable blood!
That blood killed Master Yoruk. <cf> That blood
It drove Master Dunkirk mad.
Deputy Commander,...... what in the world......
(Receives the key that was thrown to him.) What the hell are you ...... doing?
The key......?
If you want to know,...... go to the basement. <cf>"Dorava Royal Laboratory". Master Dunkirk is there.
In that place, the root of all evil, know the depth of your sin.
Know your sinfulness in that place.
(Rushes to the fallen Veronica)! ............, ah!
Don't worry. You just fainted.
(Relief) Huh.
The ...... blood ...... flowing through me?　And sin ......?
[--] Let's go, Master Dunkirk.
Help me, master.
What's wrong?　Einlein.
Ah ....... <cf> No, it's nothing.
The "Royal Institute of Dorava" has a Dunkirk-sama ......? <cf>Why on earth would he be in that place ......
<cf>This is a research facility of the Order of Buffalia. <cf>They were also developing weapons in collaboration with the Order.
Is there something in the back of this place that we don't know about? ......
(Called out) N......
...... I see, you have a skilled collaborator.
You're a lucky man, my friend.
Mr. Dunkirk, me and Einlein did not kill <cf>Your Majesty</cf>!
Yes, I know.
You are not the man to do such a thing.
But you must be. You and the oracle priestess <cf> will die as assassins of the Prince.
Lord Dunkirk ......?
At least, you may follow me here.
Whose [--]!
(Shock)!
(Grunts) Uh-uh!
...... know who this is?　Carveen.
(Grunts) Uh-uh......
(Shock) Ah......
(Grunts) Aahhhh......
Hey, what's going on!　This is no time to freeze up!
(Grunts) Aaaa......aaaah!
Einlein......
No way......
(Grunts) Ugh......
...... Yolk?
Nah [--]
(Grunts) Aaaaahhhh......uuu
...... Yoruk was killed by Avaritia. <cf>That's what I told you guys, right?
Yeah, that's right. I have only one family [--].
[You][sir][et al] killed him with <cf>my</cf> own hands, not knowing that [you][sir][et al] had made him into an avaritia!
(grunts) uaaaaaaaaaaa......
(Grunts) Ugh, ugh.
(Grunts) Aaaaaaah!
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
(Stunned) ......!
This is my very repentance for my son at my hands. <cf> Know that despair for yourself!
Take a stand, Carveen!　Protect Einlein!
Get ready, Carveen!　Protect Einlein!
(grunts) "Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
(Ready...) ......
(grunts) "Aaaaaaaaaaah!
(Staggering from the damage - kneeling) Ugh ......ts!
...... I wonder if saving your life in those ruins <cf> led to this defeat ......
If I could do it over again, I would have killed you then ......
(Advancing to Dunkirk.) ......
Tell me ......
The sub-commander said that the blood of the abomination that flows in my veins drove you mad.
And you said we <cf> made Yoruk avaritia!
What in the world am I ......?
Do you still have ...... the sword that was my mother's memento?
(Takes out a dagger) ......
What is this ......?
If it weren't for that, I wouldn't <cf>hate you so much......
(tackles Carveen) --Ugh!
Ugh!
(gets sent to Dunkirk) Gah! ......!　Ugh......!
(Picking up the dagger, he stands up) Huh......
No more ......
I will not be made to dance in the hands of God!
(Stabbing the knife into his neck) H......--!
(Gasping) Ha......!
Dan......
(dismayed) Oh, oh...... oh......
Yoruk......
Oh, oh......
Oh, oh, oh, oh！！！！！
(Crying ear to ear) Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ......!
Let's take the two ...... outside. <cf> Everything here is ...... stagnant......
(Dismay) ah...... ah...... kuk......
It was ......2 months ago. Lord Dunkirk was ordered by His Majesty to defeat <cf>Abaritia</cf> that appeared in the basement of the castle.
A monster of a strange shape that I have never seen before. <When he heard its demise, Master Dunkirk knew.
The one he had taken into his own hands was the Aberritya-turned-Yoruk-sama.
How could Yoruk ......
You ask that?　Priestess of the Oracle.
The original culprit was the Order of Buffalia.
(surprise)!
[--]Well, the Diocese of Barnhart did it on their own. <cf> No wonder the priestess of the oracle doesn't know about it.
They joined forces with the Duchy of Barnhart to create <cf>an easy-to-handle pseudo-avaritia</cf>.
In order to efficiently offer more engrams to the <cf>Baphalian Gods</cf>.
Wait a minute! <cf>The Buffalian Gods are a fairy tale ......
They are real. <cf> Sometimes they come down to earth and do bad things.
(confused)!
But the pseudo-avaritia project was stalled. <cf>[--][Tengei][Tengei]'s [Seido], until 'that thing' appeared in the [Seido].
Avaritia Shell or ......!
If you combine the body tissue of the thing with a human being, you get ....... <cf>You've seen what happened, right?
It was ...... crazy. <cf>The face of Dunkirk when he found out everything.
<cf>The man who was proclaimed to be the greatest knight of his time cried in public, you know?
Well, it was already amazing. After he learned the truth, he went straight to the bottom of the matter. <cf>He had us attack the dukedom and assassinate the king amidst the commotion.
All those involved in the plan were hanged.
Naturally, the Buffalian cult bore the brunt of it.
But no matter how hard we try, we can't touch the heavenly beings who were responsible for it.
The hatred that has nowhere else to go will only grow. <cf>[--]That's why I told you.
That the sword you hold belongs to the Buffalian Gods.
(Stunned.) Ha! ......
Yes, your mother is of the Buffalian God Tribe.
<cf> I guess that's what they call the moment when the last remaining reason shatters.
After all, the man you loved like a son is <cf> the child of the hateful, hateful Buffalians, right?

......Who are you?
......Who are you
I like the way this woman looks, though. <cf>I don't think I [fit in] yet.
I like the way she looks. <cf> I don't think I'm comfortable with her yet.
(braces himself against the wind pressure) Damn!
(braces himself with wind pressure) Whoa ...... damn!
(Surprised by wind pressure) Ah!
Dragon tribe ......! <cf>What do you mean?
You, what have you done with the sub-commander!
<cf>I ate him just now, while he was sleeping in the courtyard.
Gabri!　And .......
(turns his face away, behind Carveen) Ah!
And the sight of it.
The memory.
Flesh and blood.
It's all mine!
(Laughing maniacally) Ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Laughing maniacally) Ha-ha-ha!
You!
(Lances at him - shockwave - blows him away.) <cf>...... ooooh...... kkk!
I never thought I'd fall behind these guys. <cf>Vordigen has fallen behind.
I haven't had a chance to play in a while. You can thank Dunkirk for that.
Oh, you can't anymore?　Excuse me, excuse me.
(takes off laughing) Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Wait [----]¡!
(chuckles ruefully) KU......
We're going to ...... the courtyard. I have to see if Veronica, <cf>that dragon tribe, is what she says she is. ......
(Noticing) Ah...... ah!
(Noticing) Ah............
Oh?　That's ......
King Norbert!
(Seeing Carveen's condition)!
Your Majesty!　Are you safe?
(surprised) My Lord!
(startled) Ah!
The husband of the Coin Pavilion: ......? <cr>
How did you get here ......
(Carveen is pressured) Wow ...... ah!
What are you talking about? <cf> This is the
Duke of Barnhart, <cf> His Majesty Norbert, the Duke of Barnhart!
No, Feste's not wrong.
I am the husband of the Two-Faced Coin Pavilion,[--] the
Duke of Barnhart, and also the Duke of Barnhart.
(Pause.) Oh, ......
No, no, don't be silly. I've never pretended to be such a thing before. ......<cr>
Besides, wasn't the Duke assassinated?
There are many things, even this.
There's a lot of things you can't even ...... tell me.
(In an air of secrecy) Hmmm...
I've heard everything about the process up to now from the secret agent. <cf> I also just confirmed Veronica's death.
Thanks to you and your team, we were able to <cf>prevent</cf> the rebellion of the Dunkirk faction. I thank you.
Oh, please wait!　It is not a rebellion! <cr>
The Knight Commander was experimented on Yoruk [--].
Even though it is a partial outburst, what would <cf> the people think if they knew what the Order has done?
(Stuck for words) Ah...
The Diocese of Barnhart was acting <cf>unanimously</cf> without following the wishes of the Order!
This led to misunderstandings and an unfortunate misunderstanding between the Order and the Duchy.
We are grateful for the understanding of His Highness King Norbert in this matter. <cf>The relationship between the two sides is already a good one.
Knight Commander Dunkerque is distraught by the unexpected death of his son
He plotted to usurp the throne. This is the end of the matter.
(He swallows his words in frustration.) ............
...... Someday, history will reveal the truth. <cf>Until then, you remember Dunkirk.
......Your will
......Let's go to Yoruk's tomb later<cr>.
Master Dunkirk will be there ......
We will <cf> take you to the [seidou] of [tenkei], priestess!
Your bill is now paid. <cf>Leave the pavilion, stay, or do as you please.
......Oh, I'll do as I please!
Ha ha ......
(smiles)
Well, we should head back to Canaroa for now.
Jake and the boys should be waiting for us.
Good job!
I'm glad you guys are safe. ......
Hey, listen up. While you guys were gone, <cf>Big News broke!
The Lord King is actually alive?
And that Carveen, the assassin, was the hero who prevented the <cf>Dunkirk Rebellion</cf>?
What, you know about that?
You idiot. We were at the castle just now.
It's like we made that Big News.
Wow! I knew it!　You're right! <cf> You are the Hero who saved this country!
By the way, where are you two?
Carveen's getting ready for the ceremony at the castle. <cf>After all, he's the Hero who saved the country.
(He wonders mildly about Feste's situation.) ......?
Einlein has returned to the Order. <cf>He missed you too.
Well, thank goodness......
......Somehow you've become a distant person all of a sudden. ......
Sorry it's too late for that. I'll return this......
Sorry it's too late. I'll return this......
Oh ...... pendant......!
That was really helpful. Thank you so much.
That was really helpful. Thank you.
Yeah. ...... I'm still so calm with this.
Now, back to Asterlys. <cf>This time we can go with our heads held high!
<cf>Carveen, the hero who prevented this rebellion. <cf> In reward for your loyalty to the Duchy, I bestow upon you a prize.
<cf> I have made it especially for you. <cf> Bequeath it to your children and grandchildren, and honor it forever.
<cf> You shall inherit it to your children and grandchildren for ever!　Thank you for the happiness!
(I noticed it.) Oh, ......
I've seen this ...... somewhere ......
Well, that's it for me. <cf>That was the most thrilling adventure I've had in a long time.
I'm here too. <cf>Thanks for all your help.
Honestly, you've been a big help. Jake. <cf> Even you can be useful.
I said the ...... reward was good, but now you've paid for it. <cf>I'll have the old man at the coin pavilion collect it for you.
About that, that ......
The owner said he would continue to ask me to stay. <cf>It looks like he won't be back for a while.
Geez, seriously? <cf>I mean, when did you see your father?
<cf>When I was in Kanaroa. <cf>By the way. Let Charlotte stay with you for a while.
<cf> Well, if that's what your father wants, I guess I'll have to do it. <cf>I guess I'll have to leave her a little longer.
......Wouldn't it be nice to have a place to go back to?
<cf>Ainlein and the others should already be on their way.
<cf>Welcome back. <cf>I am glad you are safe.
Dunkirk died at ......, didn't he?
Perhaps that's why your future looks a little different. <cf>It's turning around as a result.
Apparently, Mr. Dunkirk was one of the keys to avoiding <cf>future doom!
Dunkirk is the future ......?
Mm ....... <cf>Now, let's go to the [cathedral] of the [heavenly blessing]!
<cf> ...... seems to have calmed down.
(faintly responding to Erinze's call) Ah......
[--]!　Look at that!
What?
(Faintly moving) ......
(startled) Ah!
...... ahead, Pai ......
Did you speak ......?
(Thrilled) ......!
Tirith has spoken!　She's talking!
My consciousness started to separate from the avaritia shell!
Now we can see a way to rescue Tirith. ......
(Laughing with joy) Ha ha ha ha!
(Tears of relief) Ha ha!
(Smiles) Huh.
Wait and be sure to ......!
Wait and be sure to ......!
Einlein-san has rewired and <cf>Tirith and Avaritia Shell are now stable!
but that doesn't solve the fundamental problem. We won't feel safe until we <cf>separate Tirith.
Whatever the method, we must save Tirith ......
Oh?　Is this from ...... Bashlar?
＜Regarding the movements of the Dragon King Voldigen.
＜As far as we can tell, there is no sign of Voldigen activity at this time.
<cf>However, there has been a change in the future. <cf>This could be the result of your actions.
<cf>As a result, there is a possibility that the activities of the Vordigens and other dragon tribes will also increase. Please be careful.
＜In particular, it would not be surprising if Voldigen had some kind of connection with Avalitha Shell.
Vordigen and Avalitya Shell ......? <cf>Where was there any connection?
＜In the first place, Voldigen was the first subject of the Avalitya Shell project.
<cf> In the early stages, his person was to be used as the base material to form <cf> the Avalitya Shell.
<cf>His person, however, did not conform and was disposed of as waste. <cf>In the process, he rebelled against the Divine Tribe and escaped.
What a ....... So, if all went according to plan, Voldigen would have become <cf>Avaritia Shell</cf>.
That's going to cause even more trouble. ...... <cf>A very bad plan indeed!
＜Now, Voldigen is trying to take in his conformant, Erlinse-sama.
<cf> I assume that by doing so, he intends to fuse himself with the Avalytea Shell.
＜Ultimately, through the Shell, he intends to bring the beasts of the planet under his control.
<cf> Vordigen is also a factor in the future of destruction. <cf>Do not be alarmed. That is all.
Erlinse. <cf>Did you also know the story of this area?
<cf> That Voldigen was a subject. <cf>So, I believe that the resentment of the dragon tribe against the god tribe runs deep.
I have been in hiding for a while now. ...... <cf>We have to be careful with Voldigen.
Well, as long as the Shell is in the "Seido of Heaven's Blessing,"<cf>I don't think the Dragon Tribe will be able to touch it.
You can enter Barnhart Castle from here.
Would you like to go "inside Barnhart Castle"?
You can go outside Barnhart Castle from here.
Would you like to go to "West Barnhardt Peninsula - Under the Lonely Castle"?
Thanks to you, relations between the Order and the Duchy have been restored.
Lady Einlein and the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings are safe and sound.
On behalf of the Order, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Is there any change in the situation of the "messenger"?
I have heard that there is no particular change, but if you have any concerns, please come directly to me.
Yes, I will do so.
<cf>Well, thanks to Ms. Einlein, you seem to have calmed down.
Yes. Many things have happened, but it is a great harvest that Tirith has regained some <cf>consciousness.
But what do we do from here? ......
About that: ......
How about <cf> doing a chronoleap and going back to <cf> before Tirith was fused?
(puzzled) ugh! ...... ugh ...... mu
As I recall, Bashraal told you. <cf> You've already practiced it, and it all failed.
Yes. <cf> But there is a method he hasn't tried yet.
<cf>I will go back before Bashraal takes me and <cf>break the Chronogate!
(confused)... ...... ah!
(What are you talking about? <cf>If you do that--)
The source of this problem is Bashlar's attempt to merge me with <cf>Avaritia Shell</cf>.
In other words, if Bashlar had not been able to come to this time period, <cf>We would not have been taken away ......
Tirith would not have fused with the Shell ......?
Bashraal is only working on the <cf> premise of the fusion between me and Shell!
That's why they couldn't even <cf>reach the act of destroying the Chronogate. Isn't that the reason for the failure?
But [--]
If you can't go back to the future, <cf>you'll have to go back to Voldigen[--].
If you can't go back to the future, <cf> you will [--] to Voldigen[--].
(Smiling) Huh.
The only chronogate that is active in this time period is <cf> "Mihashira" of "Kamigakari".
Even if I were to be eaten, there is nothing even Voldiggen can do if he cannot return to the future.
...... you do not want to go back to your own time?
...... for the future of Tirith and, by extension, of the planet.
I would gladly live in this time period.
Oh, a little before this time. <cf>I must be careful not to meet with my past self.
...... Then I must be careful too!
...... then I must be careful too
No, it's only me who goes back in time.
You don't have to come with me, okay?
All right, I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
It is the Lord's duty to take care of his servants.
(surprised and confused) ah......
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but <cf> do you have a chronogram to go back in time?
I have an idea. <cf>You can ask Charlotte.
Charlotte has a <cf>chronogram</cf>?
Yes, she has a pendant that contains a high purity chronogram.
Now what do we do?
(Sighs and smiles) Huh, ......!
<cf>Go with me to the past. <cf>Live with me in that time!
With you, I fear nothing!
All right!　Let us change the past with our own hands!
(nodding)
 <cf> Why are you here?
I wanted to check with Charlotte. <cf>We were just talking about it.
This is the pendant Carvain gave me from the Duke and <cf>my pendant. ......
...... hmm? <cf>Isn't it the same one?
No, His Majesty said it was 'specially made for me'. <cf>I can't imagine it being the same one.
But I've had this since I was a child,......<cf> and that's exactly when it was picked up,......
Excuse me, may I <cf>show you mine?
...... They are both very nice pieces. <cf>Mr. Charlotte's is older, though.
<cf>They are probably one-of-a-kind, judging from the way they are made.
<cf>But you have two in front of you, don't you?
Did the craftsman make them to imitate?
They are too similar for that. <cf>It looks like ......
......?　What's wrong?
No, it's nothing. <cf>It can't be, because ......
Is it a coincidence? <cf> Something seems to be bugging me. ......
By the way, do you guys want me too?
Can I borrow your pendant again? <cf>We really need it now.
Can you lend me the pendant again? <cf>We desperately need it now.
Yes, please. <cf>It's what the man who saved my life asked me to do. As many times as you want.
Erinze. <cf>Take a look at what's in the pendant.
I don't believe it. <cf>It's a really high purity chronogram. ......
I don't know what it is, but it's amazing stuff. it.
Yes. ......! <cf>Thank you, Charlotte!
Now, let's head to the [mihashira] of [kamigakari]. <cf>You must not squander your kindness.
You can find out more at ....... I've just realized something I don't like.
We are going to go to the past and not come back, aren't we?
If so, then this pendant ...... <cf>Won't you be able to return it?
You needn't worry about that.
If we destroy the Chronogate, there will be no more chronoleaping.
In other words, there will be no future for us to borrow the pendant from Ms. Charlotte.
We will no longer be able to jump back in time!
So the <cf> pendant will remain in the hands of Ms. Charlotte in the new future!
Unnnnnnnnnn....... <cf> Well, that was ah, and then this happened: ......
And anyway, <cf> Charlotte's pendant will remain in her hands, right?
Yes. I can assure you of that.
Then, good! <cf>As one would expect, we can't just leave it on loan.
<cf>I'm relieved that it will remain in Charlotte's hands. <cf>We'll be very grateful and put it to use.
<cf>It's always goodbye when we look up at the pillar like this.
Is that all right? <cf> We cannot meet the Tirith of the past.
We will never see her again. ...... <cf>This will be our last goodbye.
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't miss ......
But if it will help her. <cf>If it doesn't put you in this nightmarish situation[--].
I would be more than happy.
It's all right. <cf>I can be with Tillis in the past, <cf>as we always have been.
...... understand. Then I will say no more.
Tirith ....... <cf>The other me, please.
Please just wait a little bit. <cf>Because we can all laugh and travel together once again.
...... It's all right. <cf>Time and space are stable.
The time to return is around the time we arrived in Salamzat. <cf>Before Tirith makes contact with Bashraal.
Go to ......
......It looks like we arrived safely at the specified time!
Well then, let's get on with it.
Servants, let's break it down as hard as we can.
Let's do it thoroughly and completely. <cf>Do it thoroughly to the central part where the self-repairing function does not work!
That's right!　<cf> Do it with all your might, with all your might, with no regrets, with no worries!
(Agreeing) Hmmm... ...... Hmmm... (Chuckling - posture)
(Chuckles ~ posture) Hmmm, ......!
(Surprised by the arrow)
(Surprised by the arrow) Ah!
Watch out!
(startled) Ah--!
What is that?
That's ......<cf> the ...... that attacked Miss Charlotte in Salamzart!
Here they come!
Why are they here ......?
...... "Alicia bless you!"
The Chronogate!
(Surprise)--!
Alicia's blessing!
(Surprise!) Alicia, bless you!
(Surprise!　Aaah!
(Landing) -- oh!
(Rushing toward the Chronogate) --- oh!
(Surprised and worried)---Gosh, ......!
Can't you do something!
(Hitting the wall) Damn!　(Pounding on the wall) --Ts!
It's no use!　You can't stop it now!
You guys, you can't change the future.
(Surprise)!
You can go back to the past as many times as you want. <cf> Then strangle yourselves!
Ah, but you can't go back, can you?
Die looking into a future of despair.
(surprise) ah......
The world after ......2000 years......?
No way, you were jumped to this time ......?　Why ......
You're looking at that!
(Surprise) is--!
The future of doom......!
The world is being ...... swallowed up......
The beast of ...... [planet] ......?
Whoa!
Kyah!
Geez!
Hurry back!
(Turn around) --
You are the--
This gate will be broken by the beast of [planet]! <cf> So hurry!
You'll never be able to return from this time period!
(exclaims) Ha--!
(rushes in)!
You, too, quickly!
It's okay. You'll be fine.
(Surprise) Oh, ......!
(Relief) Huh......
(Relief) Ha......
You could come back and ...... come ......?
Yes, somehow. <cf> Now you're right after jumping back to the ...... past.
So you're back to square one......
Well,<cf>my head is a bit of a mess because of all the ...... things that happened at once!
I'm also ....... <cf>I'm still trying to wrap my head around the situation.
...... that man in the armed group. <cf>You knew the activation word for the chronogate.
That's impossible. <cf>That was supposed to be known only to a limited number of people.
And even the future of perdition......
The future ......
That's ...... the end of this planet......
...... Really, our civilization is going to perish.
That's why you're going to change that future, right?
That's why you're going to change that future, right?
...... That's right. That's right.
That's why I'm here.
(nods) Hmm.
Okay, let's go back to the past once more! <cf> This time we must destroy the Chronogate!
Perhaps we will be attacked again. <cf> Let's be cautious!
<cf>Now, that's rather convenient. <cf>This time we'll take them alive and make them tell us all sorts of things!
(suspiciously) Oh, ......
(Surprise) --!
The chronogram is ......
No matter how high the purity of the chronogram, <cf>there must have been a limit......
But then, the chronoleaps are already ......
(shakes head) ......
...... There's no point in staying here. <cf>Let's go outside.
I must return the pendant to Charlotte. <cf> It's a little hard to say that I've lost the contents of the pendant. ......
<cf>Welcome back. <cf>Are you done with your errands?
Sorry. My bad.
Sorry. My bad.
There was an armed group that attacked you, wasn't there? <cf> We got into a fight with them on the way to the .......
The pendant's contents were broken. ......
...... It's okay!　Don't worry about it. <cf>See, I didn't even know it was in there to begin with.
<cf>I'm just glad you guys are okay. <cf>That makes me happier.
Thanks for the ......
Huh ...... what can I do? <cf>I'd jump again, but without the chronogram: ......
I can't ask Bashraal to do it.
We have no choice. <cf>We'll have to find out somehow.
First, we can try the ones closest at hand.
......I was an orphan. <cf>When they found me, they had this pendant in their hands.
So this is the only clue to my parents, <cf>but I don't know anything else.
Was it a chronogram ......? <cf>I didn't even know it was in there.
Can you tell me what it's about sometime? <cf>I might know something about my parents.
The masters fought with the armed group you know, right? <cf>...... they're still lurking around somewhere.
And they attacked not only Charlotte, but also <cf>the masters. ......
I knew I should have exposed them at the <cf>Salamuzat</cf> that time!
Hey! <cf>A face that doesn't look good on you.
<cf>It's almost time for the annual "Seirei Matsuri", isn't it? <cf>Let's have some fun once in a while!
It's a festival where people from all over the world gather. <cf>We're thinking of a special menu too.
<cf>This is the perfect chance to sell the name of the Two-faced Coin Pavilion!
How do the Buffalian gods procure the chronograms?
The chronogram is refined from a large amount of engrams[--]<cf>especially those based on human thoughts.
<cf>In the past, we used the power of the Buffalian religion to collect the engrams.
<cf>In my time, the power of the Faith has been reduced, and this is not always possible, so it has become precious...<cf> Ah...
Well, Jake, you mentioned earlier <cf>the "Star Spirit Festival", didn't you?
Yes, it's about that time of year. It's about time. <cf>What about it?
Yes, the "Star Festival" is still going on here ....... <cf>Then we may be able to work something out!
The Star Festival is a celebration of the Buffalian religion, but <cf>its real purpose is something else!
It is to gather the thoughts of many people and create <cf>"offerings to the gods"</cf> ......
That offering is the Chronogram!
Oh my!　So the Order has a chronogram ......? <cf>Okay, let's go talk to Einlein right away!
Masters, are you going to see Einlein? <cf>Then I'll go too!
If Carveen is going, I am too!
...... What are you going to do?　If we go to the [seidou] of [tenkei], <cf>no matter what, we're going to see Tirith!
...... No, it's a good opportunity. <cf>Let's talk to both of you about what's going on.
Right now, Ms. Einlein's safety is <cf>Tillis's stability.
We <cf>need as many people as possible to help us protect her.
Well, ...... I understand. <cf>I have no objection if you say so.
It's getting worse......!
Carveen......Ah......
Why are you here......
...... because I was worried about you.
(Smiles)!
(Runs out)!
What the hell happened?
...... Just now, there were signs of an awakening in the [mitsuka].
<cf>I immediately re-established the warding, so it's all right. <cf> But he uses more power than before. ......
What was that? <cf>What is Einlein doing here ......
And that one....... <cf>I'm sure that's her, ...... Tillis. ......?
That's an avaritia shell. <cf>It is also said to be God's messenger.
It's a long story. ...... <cf>I think it would be good for you to know.
(nods).
(Looking at Erinse) Oh, ......
(Looking at Erinze) Oh, ......!
(Look at Erinze) ah......
...... Listen to me. <cf>The journey through time that we have followed [--].
The future ...... Buffalian Gods Tribe ......
Chrono-leap?　History changed? <cf>How can you change what happened in the past? ......
God......
I don't blame you for being skeptical. <cf>It's a ridiculous story.
...... I remember the first time I <cf>lent you the pendant.
You guys were desperate then. <cf>To get Mr. Erinse out of time.
It doesn't seem to me that what you just said is a lie. <cf>So [--]I believe you.
Master ......
(Called out) ......!
If that thing hadn't jumped six months ago,......<cf> Yoruk said,......
Let's do what we can now, shall we?
That would make Yoruk happy......
...... I'm sure he would.
Yeah, I bet that guy would.
Well, now. Now that we know what's going on [--]
Let's find a way to help Tillis-san. <cf> Even Einlein's in trouble if we don't.
(nods) Yeah.
<cf>I am relieved to be able to confide in you all.
Now, to save Tirith this time. <cf> Let's go back to the past as soon as possible!
<cf>To do so, we need an offering to God.
That is why, Einlein. <cf>Do you not have an offering?
I'm sorry. I don't know ....... <cf>All such things are managed by Lugerio.
Where is this Lugerio now?
He had a discussion with the chief priests today. ......<cf> I think he should be back at the temple in Asterlys by now.
Hm. Let's go back to the temple then. <cf>It would be bad to stay here too long.
I'll go back, too. <cf>See you later, Einlein. See you later.
Take care of Tirith, Einlein. <cf>Can I come see you again, too?
<cf>Yes. I want you to come again. <cf>Charlotte too ...... Take care.
Is it an offering? ......
If so, we gave them all to the gods after the Hoshinrei Festival.
The only thing I can give you now is a piece like this.
(Shakes his head from side to side) ......
It's not enough to give ......
You are going to have the Hoshinreisai again this year, aren't you? <cf> If possible, could you give us the offerings you will make then?
(Shakes his head from side to side) N......
<cf>The decision has just been made to cancel the Hoshirei Matsuri.
We are unable to get the "Star Spirit Divas" needed for the ritual.
Star Spirit Divas are not the mainstay of the ...... Star Spirit Festival!
Three divas are needed to make the offerings!
However, two of them died during a raid by the principality. <cf>The remaining one has a wounded throat and has returned to her homeland. ......
Yes yes yes!
I'm running for diva!
(dubiously) Hmm, hmm......
I'm pretty confident I can sing. <cf> Wanna listen?　Do you want to listen?　Okay, let's listen to it?
(Dumbly) Nn......
It's not that easy.
Okay?　To be a diva [--]
(exclamation) Oh~!
(exclamation) Ho-ho~!
(exclamation) Wow, wow, wow.
(exclamation) Oh, ha-ha-ha!
How do you like that?
Sure, you seem to be quite the singer, but <cf> you have to be qualified to be a diva!
See. This offering [--].
You're responding to ......?
...... Maybe you passed the test?
...... Amazingly, <cf> it seems you are qualified to be a diva!
(Laughs) Wow!
Yay!　Well, we've got one for you.
Wait a minute! <cf> You're being targeted by an armed group, remember?
If you do anything conspicuous like singing at the Seiryoku Festival, you might get attacked again.
<cf> I might be attacked again? <cf>Of course, there is that risk, but ......
But more importantly, you need the Chronogram now, right?
Even Einlein is putting her body on the line, you know. <cf>Then I want to do what I can do too!
That...and...and...and...and...and...and...and!
What better chance to sell <cf>the beautiful Charlotte, the up-and-coming traveling diva who is rapidly gaining popularity!
(Stupefied) ah......
(Stupefaction) ah......
(Stupefaction) ah......
(Stunned) Hmmm......
...... I have no choice. Don't do anything rash, please.
Yeah!　No!
If we get all the divas together at this rate, we can have a <cf> Seirei Matsuri</cf>, can't we?
(nodding in confusion) No. ......
Okay, I've got two more! <cf>I'll get you two more, no matter what it takes!
We've decided on Charlotte as one of the divas. ......<cf>There are two more!
<cf>One of them went back to her hometown with a throat injury, I heard. <cf>Can't we bring him back?
[There is still no news of his recovery, though there is a medicine that is said to be very effective in his hometown.
The name of that one is Lalaforte. <cf>He is of the blood of the People of the Forest.
In fact, the Order and the People of the Forest <cf>have been having some problems. ......
<cf>The Order's people are not allowed to enter <cf>Lalaforte's homeland</cf>.
So Lalaforte is going alone?
Yes, she is. We will have to wait for them to contact us.
Then perhaps it would be quicker if we went out there ourselves to check on him.
If you are looking for Lalaforte, it would be better to go to <cf>"Cape Lawehara".
The forest people's [hometown] is in the [outer continent]. <cf> Cape Lawehara is the gateway to the forest.
Please use this offering to identify the singing voice. <cf>It should glow in the same way as Charlotte's.
We should also look for those who have the qualities of a diva here.
We, too, would like to hold a star festival. <cf>It is an important ritual to honor the gods.
<cf>A star diva is also an essential part of the Order, though not as important as the oracle priestesses.
So, let's get going! <cf>If we go to Cape Lawehala, there should be a regular boat from the harbor.
Wait a minute. You're going too?
Of course. You're the girl who sings with me. <cf>I have to see it with my own eyes!
I'll go with you. <cf>Your escort isn't finished yet.
Excuse me. I'll stay here. <cf>I'm concerned about Tirith's suddenly deteriorating condition. ......
Perhaps the incident at [Mihashira] <cf>may have affected her. ......
Mm, yes. Let me know if you need anything.
The boat to Cape Lawehala is <cf>almost ready to sail!
Well, we're on it!
Here we are at last!　[The Outer Continent!
This is not like the Magna Continent. <cf>It is only recently that the population has begun to increase.
There are still many uncultivated places in the backcountry. <cf>Now, a new stage of adventure awaits us!
Hm?　My servant, the omnistron is responding. <cf> Did you receive my message?
<cf> It is Eirinse. <cf> Have you arrived at Cape Lawehara by now? <cf>
<cf>There is no change in Tirith at this time. <cf> I hope you will be at ease.
<cf>I am, for the time being, in the care of the Temple of Buffalia in Asterlys.
<cf>I also asked the congregation about Ms. Lalaforte. <cf>I heard that you were active in the last Star Festival.
Hmmm. <cf> It seems certain that Lalaforte is an experienced diva.
<cf>A precious story comes with a price, doesn't it? <cf> So I paid her some money.
<cf> about 10,000,000 lounos, but he was very pleased.
Noooooo!
Wait a minute!　This is not the kind of information that you would pay that much money for!
<cf>Bashraal had given me some money for something, and it came in handy.
<cf>So, don't worry about this one. <cf>We are looking forward to your return. <cf> We look forward to seeing you soon.
No, no, no, no! <cf> Now that you mention it, I'm rather full of worry!
Erinze's. <cf>We'll never know where we're going with our finances!
I must quickly find Lalaforte and go home. <cf>I believe you said you were of the blood of the people of the forest.
...... hmm?　Hey, where's Carveen?
Huh?　He was just there a minute ago.
Next to wasting time, you're lost! <cf>Totally, all of them are ......
Servant, let's find Carveen first. <cf>Ah, they're such a pain in the ass!
Forest people. ......
Besides, this scenery ....... <cf>Something looks familiar[--].
Oh, Carveen! <cf> Don't wander around alone!
......?　What's wrong?
No, nothing. <cf>I was just curious about the forest people[--]!
Na[--]!　Oh, that one!
Have you never been to the Principality?　If so, I'll show you around.
There's a restaurant that serves great tea. <cf> The interior is nice, and they have cute little things [--].
Mr. Hugo! <cf>What are you doing alone in a place like this?
......!
Aaaaaaahhhhhh, you got away from me, didn't you? <cf>You come at me with your great swordsmanship. ......
What, do you know him?
This is the high civil official of Barnhardt, Master Hugo. <cf>He is currently at the side of the king, restoring domestic affairs.
He was supposed to be ......
What happened to your guards?　What are you doing here?
I wish you wouldn't look at me like that. <cf> I came here on business. An inspection.
I am currently planning to emigrate from the Principality to the outer continent. <cf>I was just gathering information about this area.
Now I was hearing things from a woman's point of view. This can't be left <cf> with a mousy knight, can it?
From a woman, no. ....... Then I would like to ask you one question. <cf>There is a place around here called Lalaforte: ......
Oh, there is a beautiful lady there too! <cf>Excuse me, I have a few questions: ......
Mr. Hugo! <cf>...... what's with that guy?
Is that Barnhardt's high civil servant......? <cf>Isn't there some kind of mistake?
Oh look, Master Hugo is an excellent civil official. <cf>The politics of the principality cannot be discussed without that man.
I don't think so very much. ...... <cf> Anyway, let's ask him about Lalaforte.
Hey, my lord. You know a lot about the <cf>women</cf> who live around here, don't you?
Of course I do. Do you know how much passion I have for these ladies?
There is nothing about the women of this region that <cf>I don't know!
What are you bragging about? ...... <cf>And have you not heard of a woman named Lalaforte?
She is of the blood of the people of the forest. <cf>I believe she stops around here.
Lalaforte ....... <cf>Oh, you mean the Star Spirit Diva?
I heard that she lives <cf> in a hermitage outside the village.
I hear she is quite an exotic beauty. <cf>I haven't had the pleasure of meeting her, but I'm fascinated by her.
By the way, Carveen. <cf> You have a very beautiful woman with you.
Is that her? <cf> Which is your true love, Lady Einlein?
<cf> That's not what I meant! <cf>She's my escort!
Hmmm. Well, yes, she is. <cf>She's not my escort.
Huh?　Huh?　Why are you mad at me!
And what is it actually?
No, its ....... <cf> I'm looking for a diva to open the Star Spirit Festival.
Oh?　I heard from the new head priest of <cf>Barnhardt parish</cf> that they are canceling the Star Spirit Festival this year.
He said that they don't have enough divas to make it happen.
I'm going to be the diva!
...... you?
Yes, I am!　Come and listen if you like!
...... Oh, yeah? <cf> Oh ...... no, that's great!
Now that I have the energy to do my job, I'm going back to my inspection!
I look forward to the Star Festival, beautiful diva!
...... I'm sure he's a tricky one. <cf> He seems strangely knowledgeable or something ......
Oh well. Lalaforte is at the nearby Iori. <cf>Let's go there and see if it is true!
Are you the diva Lalaforte?
We are the messengers of Lugerio. <cf>We are gathering divas to hold a star festival.
Here, this offering is proof of that.
How is your throat?　Are you able to sing now? <cf> I hear there is good medicine here, but how is it progressing [--]?
<cf> Put ...... in the [sato], and get it. ....... <cf> Punishment for joining the cult: ...... banishment and ......
You seem to have trouble speaking. Take it easy.
I'm Charlotte. I'm the new diva.
I really want the Hoshinrei Festival to be a success. <cf> So I need you to teach me a lot.
I'll definitely get my throat fixed for that. <cf>Thank you, senpai!
Hey, can I get the medicine you're talking about only in <cf>[township(sato)]?
'Numerous mosses'<cf>...... if there are any. <cf>But it's hard ...... to pick it!
Pioneer Bureau...... request............ failed,......
<cf>We are not ordinary people. <cf>We are not ordinary adventurers, are we?
Where do we go to get it?
The Valley of the Coral Rocks: ......
Okay, I've taken care of it. <cf> Let's go get some as soon as possible!
This is the place, right?　This is the place Lalaforte mentioned.
...... is behind here, right?
Don't worry, we got your back!
Oh, that's ......!
Mwah! <cf> We're one step away from the ingredients for the potion!
Leave it to me! <cf> Master!　Let's go!
Okay, we've got the "slimy moss" <cf>but ......
Ugh......... that's one hell of a smell. <cf>Is this good for the throat......?
...... you want to give it a try?
My throat is in great shape right now!　I'll pass!
I wonder if ...... this will help me sing better. <cf> Then I can try it as a souvenir of Einlein: ......
...... Carveen's head is <cf> always full of Einlein!
Eh?　No, that's not true. <cf>Just because Einlein said so [--].
Hmmm ....... <cf>I'm in my escort now. ......
(Master!　Did I say something wrong!)
I see...I see...I see...I see...I see...I see......... <cf>Young man, you're a good one. ......
Hey Carveen. By the way, <cf>what do you think of Lalaforte?　Especially her appearance?
Hmm?　Yeah, I thought she was cute. ......
Heeheeheehee? <cf>Cute?　Hmmm, yeah. Ah, yeah.
I'm under escort and my eyes are on another girl. <cf> You can afford it, eh?
(Master!? !)
And anyway, let's get the materials to Lalaforte. <cf> Come on, let's go.
Yes, I'll be there. I've got to deliver the ingredients to the lovely Lalaforte, <cf>and get back home to my beloved Einlein as soon as possible, don't I?
Oh, I was just following Master Dunkirk's words that 'you should always be attentive to women and give them compliments'<cf>. ......
What did I do wrong? <cf> Tell me, Yoruk. Master Dunkirk,......!
There ...... and there ......!
Can we make medicine with this?
Wait ...... and ......
Nn...... nn......!
(SINGING)
(Surprise) Oh ......
(Surprise) Oh......
(Surprise) Hah......!
Amazing......
That's what I call the diva of the star spirits. ......
All!　Complete!　Restoration!　Revitalization!
(Surprise!) What? ......
(Surprise) Oh, ......
(Surprise) Oh, ......
(Surprise) Oh!
I'm cured thanks to you guys!
The daily stress of not being able to speak!　Freedom from it! <cf> Now I have overwhelming freedom!
Congratulations, me. Thank you, God!
And I love you all!!!
(Surprise) Oh ...... ah!
(Surprise) ah...... ah......
Ki...... you were a very bright and cheerful person.
I'm glad you were able to speak. <cf> A smile suits you better than a sad face.
Oh no, such a straight compliment ......
(Feeling your eyes on me) Hmm, hmm?
(Giving me the stink-eye) Uhhhh...
(Gaze at me with a great face) Ew!
(Chuckles) Hee-hee-hee!
Whatever the case, I'm glad your throat is healed. <cf> Will you be able to attend the Seirei Festival?
Of course I can!　I am Lalaforte, everyone's diva. <cf>With this voice, I will make you my prisoner.
Wait...... that's my signature line! <cf>It's my signature line!　Change it to something different!
Oh my goodness, I'm a senior, aren't I? <cf>Then let's junior members follow senior members...
(upset)!
Hmmm, then let's go greet Einlein-sama. <cf>I must let him see me in good health!
Ah, Lalaforte-sama! <cf>I'm so glad to see you are safe!
I'm back. <cf>Is Master Einlein in the ceremonial room?
Yes, he is. <cf>He is appeasing the "Mikitsukai" (the messenger).
<cf>Lalaforte also knows about the "messenger," doesn't she?
Yes. I was indeed surprised when I saw it for the first time. ......
<cf>I feel relieved that you are here, Einlein-sama. <cf>Now, let's go to the ceremony room.
Diva Lalaforte. <cf>I have returned home!
I'm healed, thank goodness......
I am sorry for your concern on that occasion. <cf>By the blessings of the Buffalian gods, I am able to return here again.
I see that the wrath of God's "messenger" has been appeased.
Yes, I've managed to get back to ...... now.
By the way, Einlein-sama. <cf>Have you been practicing your singing properly?
Since you asked me to teach you, you must not be a bad singer. <cf>Practice on 1, practice on 2; no 3, no 4, warding on 5!
No, 1 must be warding, right!
Yes, leave the outside world out of it. <cf>Well, can you tell me a little about your results?
What, now ......?
Now.
Here ......?
Here.
(Surprised) ah......
(Surprised) ah......
(Surprise) Oh ...... haha
(A little surprised) Well
(Surprised) oh......
This song...... can't be like this......
It's always been like this before. <cf> But she really likes to sing ......
Hey, Charlotte. <cf>As a diva, any advice[--]?
(surprised) Ew!
(Turns around) Hmm?
(Turns around) Oh ......?
(Tears) Hah ...... hah l...... hah ...... hah ......
What's wrong? <cf> You're so bad at this, you're in despair!
(Upset) Ugh, yeah......, ugh ah ah......
I don't know...... but......
I missed it so much......
My chest was ...... in pain and ......
I missed ......?
(Noticing) Oh, ...... ah!
(Noticing) Ha!
Tears......?
Don't tell me, did you just see a change in the song? <cf> Then ......
No change ......?
Could it have nothing to do with this song......?
Anyway, I'm glad <cf>that the situation has improved, even if by coincidence.
Tirith's consciousness is definitely emerging: ......
Just one more diva needed!
The third diva...any clues?
Then ...... Lugerio is going to see her now. <cf> I've found someone who is qualified ......
What?　Where are you?
Minsterhorn: ......
Minsterhorn. Well then, let's get to it [--].
You can't...<cf> Charlotte, you're staying here.
You are to take the stage as a star-spirit diva. <cf>You will learn the proper etiquette.
Eeeee! <cf>I'm not good at that kind of thing. ......
<cf>I don't care if you're not good at it or not, it's a Shinto ritual. <cf>And it's the biggest celebration of the Buffalo-Christian religion.
Bishi without mercy!　Bashi!　I'm going to go for it!
Ka, Carveine!　Einlein! <cf> Don't look at me, help me!
I'm your bodyguard. If you want to keep yourself safe, <cf> it's best you stay here.
You'll be fine. Lalaforte is strict,......<cf>really strict,......but basically, she's kind.
I emphasized strict! <cf>No, let go!　I'll go with you!
......, we'll go alone!
Oh?　You're ...... Myrlene, aren't you?
(Noticed) Hmm!
Ah, the super beautiful girl Feste! <cf> And the adventurer who helped the teacher!
If you are ......! <cf>The diva candidate was Myrlene, wasn't she!
Apparently so~!
Are you two acquainted with each other? <cf> Then we can talk quickly!
(pressured) Oh, ......
How about this? <cf>Would you take on the matter of the Star Spirit Diva?
As you can see, you are qualified to be a diva!
Please ...... and ......
We'll be counting on you! <cf> For some reason, we want to hold the Hoshinrei Festival.
Well, ....... <cf>And may I ask one thing in exchange?
<cf>I found a strange "metal plate" at the ruins the other day. <cf>Could you bring it to me?
No matter what!　I want it, but <cf>I couldn't get to it because of the monsters.
The location is at the far end of the "Tower Rock Mine Ruins". <cf>It's a rather strange ruin that was recently discovered.
The way I see it [--].
Wow, okay! <cf>We'll take care of that.
<cf>But after you see the metal plate, <cf>please give it back to the Order once you have seen it.
<cf>Because the relics are under the jurisdiction of the Order. <cf>If there is no problem with the relic, we will return it to you later.
Yay!　<cf>If you can show them to me properly, that's fine.
It's settled. <cf>So, my servant. <cf>Let's get this over with!
The "metal plate" is in the back here, isn't it? <cf>......, Myrlene, you're a very rough one, aren't you?
<cf>That's not much trouble at all. <cf>I'll find it quickly and easily, my servant!
<cf>Myrlene said it was a strange ruin, <cf>and the "metal plate" must be here.
Kick them to the curb!　Servant!
You got the "metal plate" right, my servant!
All right!　Now we have our third diva.
Hmm?　Omnistron is reacting to something.
<cf>This is Erlinse. <cf> Where are you now? <cf>
<Cf> There is no change in Tirith's condition. <cf> I even let her hear Ms. Lalaforte sing.
<cf>I wonder what she is <cf>dreaming about. ......
<Oh, yes, yes!　I have just started <cf>"Arubaito" at the coin-operated pavilion! >
<cf>After all, in order to live in this day and age, one must have a reasonable sense of money.
<cf> I think I will start by learning from "Sara Arai". <cf> Please check back later to see the results.
...... I am surprised that you work at a coin-operated pavilion. <cf> Erinze's a bold move.
<cf> But, well, it's much more constructive to exercise than to dwell on it.
He's grown up a bit, that's all.
＜Oh, and I forgot to tell you something important.
＜Lugerio and Myrlene have returned to the temple in Asterlys.
＜They are waiting for you both, so <cf>please go home as soon as possible. Good day to you.
[<cf> I'll tell you that first! <cf>This is much more important than a part-time job!
<cf> I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I almost killed Myrlene. I almost went looking for Myrlene.
Let's go to the temple in Asterleaze, shall we? <cf> Let's deliver the metal plate to Myrlene.
Here, I've got it. <cf>This is it?
This is it!　This is the metal plate I wanted. <cf>Thank you!
Now then, let's get to deciphering and decoding!
Hmmm...hmmm......... hmmm? <cf>Hohoho...... Eh!
This is ...... wow... really? <cf>Humph...... humph, humph, humph!
Oy. Oh?
This is what this is ...... hmm hmm hmm, oh!　Ooh-ohh! <cf>whhhhhh~ ...... eh?　What what what?　Mmm-hmmmmmmm......
No, I can't hear you at all. <cf>We'll just have to wait till it's over [--].
[--]Oh, wow!
Listen to me for a second!　It is as I proposed! <cf> This is not just a sentence, it's a song. Part of a song!
Connect it with the relics we found earlier and it should make sense. <cf>This is a song passed down between peoples older than myth!
<cf>That a song has been passed down through the ages between completely different civilizations[--].
Well, wait. Wait a minute!　You're just like your master when you start <cf>talking and don't stop</cf>!
Ah ...... ahaha, I'm sorry. I just got excited.
You're right. ......
(clears throat) Hmm...
(Surprise) Ugh......
(Surprise) Oooh......
(Look at the Feste and the others)
...... like this?
Now that's the song ......
Oh, it's the one I taught Einlein. <cf> I didn't know there was more to it: ......
What?　You know that song now! <cf>Where!　How did you know it!
None of us knew it when we started looking it up. ......<cf>Please, tell me where you learned it!
Oh, no, I mean, I knew it when I realized that ...... or ......
......Well, now that you mention it, that's strange. <cf>I may have forgotten everything, but I remembered this song: ......
It seems that my memory is as hazy as yours.
I am sorry. <cf>As for this song, I don't know it either.
Oh no......
Hmmm... ......
At any rate, the three of us are all here. <cf>We should be able to hold the Hoshinrei Festival now!
Thank you for gathering the divas!
Thanks to all of you, we will be able to hold the Star Spirit Festival!
However, this does not mean that our concerns have disappeared!
So, I would like to ask <cf>you all for your continued cooperation.
We have been looking into the matter of the armed group, but <cf>as a result, we still don't know the details.
Since <cf>Mr. Charlotte started going out with you guys,<cf> there have been more and more strange faces in the town.
<cf>Asterleaze is a town where people come and go. <cf>But ...... it seems to be a little too much!
<cf>A star festival will bring more and more people to the town. <cf>Are you okay?
<cf>The area around the diva will be guarded by the Order's best guards.
Mr. Carveen will also cooperate.
In addition, the Duchy of Barnhart will also send a group of knights.
They are here to apologize for the incident.
We would be grateful if you two could assist us with security.
Of course. Leave it to me.
Hopefully, the Hoshinrei Festival will go off without a hitch.
<cf>The Asterlys Star Festival will now be held! <cf>To all the congregation, be notified!
<cf>When we decided to open the festival, the preparations proceeded very quickly. <cf>I'm sure everyone has been waiting for this.
Well... There is still some time before the performance begins. <cf>Let's take a little look around town.
Aa......aah~~ (panicked)
(panicking) Aaahhhhh, hah!
Plates are so easy to break. ......
Sure, they're easy to break, but I don't think it's <cf>everyone breaks them by the hundred</cf>, do you?　It's a talent of some sort: ......
Oh well. <cf>Husband, I will reimburse you for what this person broke.
(What? (looks like) Hmm.
I am not a suspicious person. I simply cannot bear to see the beautiful one in <cf>trouble.
(Stinks.) Oh? ...... Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
(Surprise.) Oh, ......-ah!
No, no. It is not such a rude thing to ask a stranger to <cf>shoulder</cf> your failure. ......
Oh, my! Not only <cf> in appearance, but also in mind, you are beautiful!
This is fate. How about it?　How about a quick cup of tea?
(In a flirtatious manner) Huh?
(He shakes my hand.) Oh, ......
In the face of the merciless passage of time, I <cf>can't regret not being able to see someone like you again, you know.
What ...... yeah ......?
Oh my!　You, I think you said Hugo. <cf> What is the high civil official of the Principality of Barnhart doing here?
(Looking at Feste) Ah!
Well, well, well. Not since Cape Rawehara. <cf> To all of you who have thwarted Dunkirk's ambitions.
What, you knew about this? <cf> Then you ignored us, you are a bad character.
(chuckles) Hmm.
And what are you doing here?
<cf>We came to inspect the Star Festival as emissaries from the Principality. <cf> We would like to make peace with the cult.
I thought I would lend the Duchy soldiers to help with some of the security. <cf>As a token of our apology, the cost will be ours.
<cf>The cost of lodging, food, and souvenirs for the soldiers we bring will fall on Asterlys, and the economy will revolve!　The Order will be enriched!
I am a man with a strong work ethic who is always thinking of everyone. <cf>So, let's go have tea!
(impatiently) Well, ......
Don't be so casual and take our employees!
Carveen is also in Asterlys, <cf> shall I invite him here?
(reluctantly) Tsk!
I don't like that uptight guy. <cf>He'll lecture me again!
No choice, I've got to get back to work. Let's get back to work. ......
Ah, but there are cute priestesses in the cult, yes.
Now, if you'll excuse me. <cf>See you again eventually, O beautiful one. ......
It is almost time for the festival to begin. <cf> Let us return to the temple together.
Excuse me, Jake. I'm going to have to leave for the day. ......
Oh. Watch out for that funny guy.
(see him off) Ha-ha-ha!
Ah!
Ah~ ......
By the way, Erinze. I don't mean to interrupt <cf>your</cf> will to work part-time, but ......
That's the way you're dressed...... mmm....... <cf>Are you going to the temple with that?
Oh, yes, I am. <cf>You shouldn't be in your work clothes.
It would be <cf> impolite</cf> if you didn't dress for the time and place.
Please wait a moment while I change.
Oh dear. I can only imagine the trouble Tirith must be going through.
I was busy, and it took up more time than I thought it would. <cf> Let us return to the temple in moderation.
<cf>Wow.........! <cf>The festival is about to begin in earnest, isn't it?
Let's ...... see what happens......
Don't worry ....... The Star Festival will be a success. <cf>I'll make it so!
(nodding) Hm.
...... So, this is the second song that we're going to start with.
I think it's interesting, but what do you think of it from a senior's point of view?
It's out of the cult's tradition, and <cf>I should stop it, but ......
Rather than falling asleep at an important ritual, <cf>I think it would be better to bring a moderate stimulation.......
I heard some disturbing conversation, are you okay?
Don't worry. We'll <cf>get it all done until the offerings are ready.
<cf>Yes, I'm counting on you. <cf>But don't overdo it.
It's about time.
Alright!　Then, let's each do our final checks and meet backstage <cf>when everything's ready!
Okay, I'll be backstage! <cf>I'm going to make you all swoon with my singing!
Charlotte, you're so full of life!
You've come to the right place. You can watch from the audience.
Oh, are you sure?
Leave the security to us and Carveen. <cf> You can enjoy the festival without worrying about it.
Now, let's check in with Lugerio one last time.
I thought it would be difficult this year, <cf>but this is how we will be able to offer our songs to the gods!
This is all thanks to all of you. <cf>Thank you God for meeting me!
I hear that <cf> you are all looking for offerings to God!
The Star Spirit Diva has a role to play in the creation of offerings.
This Lalaforte, I will help you to the end. <cf>Please, may God bless you!
The more I check the lyrics and the choreography, <cf> the more anxious I get!
<cf>In times like this, it's better not to think too much and just go with it!
But still, I never thought I would be a star spirit diva! <cf>And with Charlotte, too!
<cf>I sometimes sing to earn money for my research, <cf>and I often get to know traveling entertainers.
She told me about the songs she sings.
Yes, that's right!　I'll teach you the song that was written on the metal plate the other day, <cf>as a thank you!
I'll be able to drag <cf>Charlotte into the swamp of ancient history with this ......
Oops, I shouldn't have wasted time talking. <cf>Come on, focus!　Focus!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!
Okay, I'm getting excited!　I'm getting excited! <cf>I still love this kind of atmosphere.
Just like before I go on stage, I naturally feel empowered. <cf>I feel like I can do anything.
Of course, I haven't forgotten about the raid. <cf>But that doesn't scare me now.
I have you guys with me. <cf>I have to do what I have to do, and I have to do it well.
I'll be fine. If you want, you can call out to the others.
Let's make sure the Hoshinrei Festival is a success. <cf>I won't let any strange people get in the way!
In the name of [[......]], I hereby announce the opening of the festival. <cf>With the God of Buffalia, Einlein ["]"]
...... is a splendid opening declaration. <cf>As expected of you, Einlein-sama.
However, after the proclamation, <cf>please return to the cathedral immediately!
I know, it is my duty.
Well, the preparations seem to be going well here.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is ....... <cf>All is well, I would say. ......
The truth is, <cf>the identity of the armed group is still unknown. ......
Mr. Carveen would like to <cf>talk to you.
<cf>He's packed up at the entrance to the theater, so <cf>please visit him later.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some preparations to make.
Masters. Thank you for your time!
Carveen. How's security?
Oh, no problem. <cf> Charlotte and the others are well secured.
If the master joins us here, <cf>we'll get back at them, whoever they are.
Mr. Feste?　Is something wrong?
Mm. I'm afraid I've been a little too preoccupied with Charlotte's performance.
The armed group is targeting Charlotte, so it's only natural that they're guarding the stage.
But if we focus only on that, I think we might hit an unexpected blind spot.
It is true that ...... is a good place to start!　That's the master of the master. <cf> You've got a good point there.
In fact, the security hands are concentrated towards the stage. <cf>Although there is minimal placement elsewhere as well: ......
From an attacker's point of view, they may seem thinly spread.
<cf>The stage is left to you, Carveen. <cf>The rest will be taken care of by me and my servants.
We have the most freedom of movement.
I wish I could be of service, too. ...... <cf>In a battle, I would rather be a drag on the battlefield.
<cf>You may not mind, but enjoy Charlotte's big day!
<cf>Stay in the theater and Carveen will protect you. <cf>That way, we'll feel safer.
<cf>Yes, we'll take care of it. <cf>I won't let them do anything they don't want to do.
Please be safe.
<cf>We'll guard the temple side. <cf>There's a back entrance to the theater there.
(impressed) Wow. ......!
(Knife in hand) Ugh...gg......
What, huh!
What's about to start!
I am Charlotte, the diva of us all! <cf> Now I'm going to make you my prisoner!
Here I go!
Yay!
(Huffing and puffing) Huffing and puffing!　Huh!
(Shockwave) Whoa ...... ggghhhh!
(Attack) oh!　......ay!
(Attack) Huh!　(Shockwave) Ahh!
(hit) djwahh!
(Hit) ¡u......ts¡¡......dwah!
(Running to avoid the bow and arrow) ッ......ッ, ッ......ッ, COPY00ッ!
Damn, ......, how's it going over there?
I knew you'd show up.
What the ......! <cf> That's not what I'm talking about!
(ready)!
<cf>That's it!　With this!
Don't be afraid of battle-imagines! <cf>Servant, do it!
Phew. ...... That's all of them. ......
It's about to climax over there.
(Panting) Haahahah ......! <cf>Ugh!　Dah ...... tsk!
(Attack) Teaaaahhhh!　............hnghh!
(Attack) Duh!　Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!　(Attack - hit)!
(Attack - hit)!　Huww... ......<cf>aaahhh... ......tsu, ugh...
(Excitement) Wow!
(Relief) ah...... phew......
Thanks, guys!
Thank you!
Thanks!
...... It looks like a lot has happened, but <cf> you made it through!
Now, I report to Lugerio.
The Hoshinrei Festival has ended successfully. <cf>Thank you very much for your help!
<cf>We were able to collect more food offerings than ever before, thanks to the help of the new divas!
Well, not everything went as planned. ......
The offerings are currently being refined. <cf>Please be patient!
The divas are in a special room, <cr>presenting their songs.
Once that is done, the offerings will be completed.
Not immediately, I understand.
But a special room that produces chronograms. ...... <cf>That is intriguing. It looks like it could hold treasures.
Actually, that room is part of the temple.
If it had been destroyed in the attack at the Star Festival, <cf>the offerings could not have been refined!
No way, those guys ....... <cf> Did they know that and attack the temple?
We do not know. <cf>Only a few know of the room's existence.
I don't think that a single rogue would know about it. ......
<cf> Is it possible that someone in a position to do so is pulling the strings? <cf>Who are they, more and more?
<cf>There's a boat leaving for Jubilia, Cape Lawehala. <cf> Would you like to board?
Do you want to go to Cape Lawehara?
Beyond that is the Koaniani Forest.
That's where the people of the forest live.
Stay out of there unless you have a special need.
Thanks again for your support! <cf> Charlotte, the diva of us all!
I'm going to be on stage and I'm going to look fabulous! <cf>Call out with me, se-no!
Thank you for your support, everyone!
Please take care of me, Lalaforte! <cf>Blessings of the Buffalian gods!
I'm usually all about research, but <cf> sometimes a costume like this isn't so bad!
I'm glad to have your support! <cf>Maybe I'll get a little hooked on divas!
By the way, have you met <cf>Mr. Carveen?
Actually, I think I <cf>might</cf> know something about the attackers at the Star Festival.
Mr. Carveen captured one of them. <cf>He's in the basement right now, interrogating him.
Oh!　That's great! <cf>Okay, let's get down there right away.
Yes, by all means. <cf>The basement is down the stairs on your left.
Come on, answer the question!
Who are you people? <cf>Why are you after Charlotte?
What is your purpose?
What is it?　What's going on!
Gu...... guww!
(look at him) ah......aah......
Get away from me, Carveen!
What ...... at ......!
(Collapses) Ggh!
Is this ...... poison?
No, he's ...... dead!
Oh, no. ......　Don't tell me, you're not going to keep your mouth shut......?
It seems that ...... there are more vicious people behind this than we thought!
I guess we'll have to leave this to Lugerio.
Sorry. Go get Lugerio, will you?
Let's all get our heads straight for once.
I'm sure Lugerio and the others have <cf>checked out the rooms below. ......
......, I see you're here.
One headache after another.
We checked the poison that the man in the armed group drank, and <cf>he had an idea of what Lalaforte was talking about.
I think that poison was "grisonia grass".
It had a distinctive sweet smell. <cf>It is a poisonous flower that can only be found at Cape Lawehara!
It can only be found at Cape Lawehala ......? <cf>Can we buy it?
No, only the locals should know about it. <cf>No one will touch it because it is dangerous.
<cf>No one will touch it, and selling it would be unthinkable. <cf>It is such a strong poison!
On the flip side, ...... it's certainly not going to kill you.
To increase the toxicity of grisonia grass, you need to <cf>grind it fresh!
Maybe there <cf>is a hideout of those guys near the colony!
Um, ...... can you take me with you?
I can be a decoy. <cf>Maybe it would make it easier to locate them.
I'm scared to tell you the truth, but ......<cf>I want to know who those guys are too.
I want to see with my own eyes exactly why I'm being targeted.
......Please!
Master, I'm coming too. <cf>I'm not done escorting Charlotte yet.
I'm going to expose them for what they are and make sure they never show up again. <cf>That's as far as I'll go.
I can only <cf>pray for your safety. ......
That's fine. <cf>You keep an eye on Tirith.
How are you?
I don't need to tell you.
<cf> I don't know how the dragon people look. <cf> You can't tell the physical condition of a dragon tribe by its appearance.
And besides, you're avaritia, right?
But can I take it that you are not in your true condition yet if you are being quiet here ......<cf>?
You shut up when you're being called out on a bull's-eye, don't you?
You're the most powerful king in the history of the dragon race.
Damn it. ......
......Those men have driven you to this point. <cf>This is a fact that cannot be ignored.
You, too, seem to be in a lot of trouble.
I am ashamed to admit it. <cf> But I'm almost done.
You don't mind if I get it first, do you?
As long as I get that woman and the avaritia shell,<cf> the rest is fine with me.
(looks up) Hmm.
Nope.
One more ......
I don't know what you liked about that one, but ......<cf>well, that's fine. I'll take care of it.
Well, I'll leave you to it. <cf>Please take care of yourself, Dragon King.
......Yes, all for the sake of our beast
Oh?　I see that Omnistron has been contacted.
<cf> From ...... Bashlar ......
From Bashlar?
<Shared ......
<contacting ...... as part of a cooperative body ...... to see how ...... is doing>
Your text is choppy. <cf> Is it due to space-time disruption ......?
<cf>No change in the future ....... <cf>Our time...than ......... years after the destruction...... is confirmed......
<cf>As soon as possible............<cf >........................>
<...........................>
Apparently, there is no change in the future ......
It seems that the destruction also remains fixed. ......
After all, we must save Tirith. <cf> To avoid the future that we saw.
Yes, I'm counting on you to take care of Tirith.
Yes, I'll leave it to you.
<cf>There's quite a bit of grisonia grass around here.
Yes, that's right. <cf> Let's go a little further.
(looks around) Oh, ......
Carveen?　What's wrong?
No. ....... I knew you looked familiar.
I had a feeling when I came looking for Lalaforte, <cf>I've been in this area before.
......Yes, when I was a kid, I believe. <cf>Me and my parents were running away from someone [--].
......Why? <cf>Why did you have to run away......?
What's your name?
...... Adelaide.
You decided?
Yes, I have.
This girl's name is Carveen.
(After seeing the flashback) Oh ...... oh!
What's wrong?　You okay, Master?
...... Carveen?
(Wondering) Hmm?
I saw this light up and I saw ...... a strange sight.
This one glowed and I saw ...... a strange sight.
A woman named Adelaide was holding <cf> you, the child......
A woman named Adelaide was holding <cf> you, the child......
I never thought I'd come here and hear that woman's name.
(Turns around) Oh!
(Turns around) Ah!
Master Hugo ......?
Well, that's what you look like: ......
Welcome to this place, Star Spirit Diva!
You've done a lot of work, haven't you?
Oh, ......
It is you, isn't it?　The one who jumped us to the future at <cf>[Mihashira]?
That time!
(As if to protect Charlotte.) Buts!
(Grinning) Hmph. ......
Let's go after him!
That's grisonia grass growing around here, isn't it?
That's right. ......
There doesn't seem to be any sign of anything unusual about it. ......<cf> Is there something bothering you?
No, it's just ...... not a big deal. <cf>Let's look elsewhere.
How about around here? <cf>Grizonia grass seems to be growing in clumps......
Yes,......<cf> hmmm,...... but it doesn't seem to be any different.
What's wrong?
Nothing. <cf> Okay, let's try another place.
Dear Hugo!　What are you doing here? <cf>Are you related to that armed group?
<cf> That's just a bunch of thugs I hired for a pittance. <cf> I'm sorry to be lumped in with them.
I am Hugo, a high civil official of the Principality of Barnhart.
...... is a temporary form of concealment from the world.
<cf> I am Hugo, a high civil official of the Duchy of Barnhart.
(Question) Ah!
(Question)!
（Ah!
Far in the future, a future of beautiful despair. <cf> There, the life that was eaten and birthed by the beast of [planet (star)] ......
So to speak, a person chosen by the will of [planet].
I am one of them.
The beast of the planet ......?　The beast's apostle, you say?
Oh, don't worry. <cf> I will not do anything so great as to destroy civilization.
I only want one thing.
<cr>[--]Only the head of that woman there.
(As if to protect Charlotte.) ......ck!
(shrugs) Ha!
Do you know why you're after me? <cf>What do you people want!
Would you like to know?　I bet you do. <cf>You don't know anything, do you?
(Miffed) Hmmm..!
You know nothing about yourself, the world, or the future. ...... <cf> You ignorant and stupid woman!
Wait a minute!　He ......!
Wait, Hugo!
What's the matter with me?　Tell me!
I never refuse a favor from a woman. All right.
Once upon a time [--]
Oh, no, it was the other way around. A long time ago, in the far, far future.
A future where our beast is awakened and surrounded by beautiful despair.
A couple sent their newborn child to the <cf>far past</cf>.
It must have been unbearable for them to raise their innocent baby in a future of confirmed doom.
However, the baby grew up, returned to the future of its own volition, and <cf>became a great leader.
A leader of the foolish "Front for Survival" that unites the remaining humans and god-peoples and <cf>fights against the beast. ......
That's you. Charlotte.
......!
(Surprise) ¡Ó (Surprise) ¡Ó (Surprise) ¡Ó
I see!　The pendant! <cf>The chronogram in that ......
That was the one you <cf>used</cf> when you chrono-leaped!
That was the one you <cf>used</cf> when you chrono-leaped!
I'm ...... from the ...... future?
(grinning) Hmm.
Wait. So you're ...... in a future where both your mom and dad are ......<cf> destroyed?
Thanks to the love of your parents, huh? <cf>Thanks to them, you have been able to live in this age with ease.
[But, alas. Your parents' actions were in vain. <cf>I, of all people, will take your life.
Master Hugo! <cf> It is useless to run away any more!
If you will be quiet, I will not make it worse!
Adelaide's son, the abominable avenger, <cf> and [--]!
(agitated) Aah!
An unexpected interloper and a [--] omake subhuman.
Who's the omake!
Oh, no, no way. <cf> I never thought these things were neatly connected.
Is everything as you intended it to be in the future? <cf>[--]Charlotte
...... I don't know.
Why do you name my mother?
(directed at me) Nn.
Do you know anything about it?
The "Survival Front" led by you fought tearfully. <cf> Transcending the races, even taking in the Buffalian Gods.
You, the center of it all, the beast has [spurned] you. <cf>Because even an ant that will die if you trample it down is not comfortable being bitten
We, the apostles, have decided to move for the sake of the beast. <cf>To more accurately and more surely eliminate those who stand in our way [--]]
We have decided to kill you, the [child(s)][offering(s)][of] the [child(s)][offering(s)][of] the [child(s)][offering(s)][of] the [child(s)] sent back in time!
(Surprise) Oh!
But just before I jumped at the Chronogate, I was interrupted by <cf>your entourage
...... Adelaide, <cf> the female warrior of the Buffalian divine race!
Every time I hear that name, my wounds tingle.
Mother, is that ......?
From the same ...... doomed future as Charlotte ......
Hey, Carveen!
(Runs) (Runs)
Oh shit, shoot!
Oh, you're running around all over the place!
You know what you're getting into. Isn't that how you ran away from Adelaide, too?
My purpose is Charlotte! <cf> I don't care about Adelaide!
(pressured) Ngugu!
She really is an abominable woman. The aftermath of the battle with that thing, <cf>I've been chrono-leaped out of the chronological period I specified.
I arrived four years before the era you were sent to. <cf>This is as good as it gets!
What happened to ...... mother?
Well, you know. I think you know more than I do.
This one took over 10 years to <cf>recur</cf> because of the wounds I received from that woman.
After all, she even appears before me as an Imagine Seed. <cf>Totally, how vindictive ......
Because you keep on disturbing people like that forever.
You'll end up like that!
It was ...... that took my mother away!
Carveen!　Behind you!
(Turn around) ts--g!
(Turn around) Tz--!
(startled) Huh!
(startled) Tz-z-z! ----
The adventurer of the turnabout: ....... <cf> Your presence irritates me!
(posture)!
I'll have all your heads on a pike right here.
...... Were you the ones who took my mother away from me?
No, sir. No, sir?
Don't lie to me!
(Miffed because I don't believe you.) Nope.
You were an excellent civil official. <cf> Yoruk adored you, too. ......
Oh, Yoruk......<cf> that was a really good boy!
He ran Dunkirk just like I thought he would.
I, you know, I wanted to destroy the Buffarian cult. <cf>I wanted to get rid of everything that stood in the way of the beast.
So I wanted Dunkirk to take over the principality and <cf>damage the Order and the Gods.
But I wasn't sure how to manipulate such a serious man.
Yes. By deliberately turning Yoruk into an experiment in the pseudo-avaritia project.
I've succeeded in doing so.
(Surprise!) Ts!
(Surprise!) Ha!
Even though Master Dunkirk trusted ...... you?
You blurted out that I don't understand politics.
Yoruk had you as his target, but ......?
He was a good boy to remember. <cf> You didn't look like Dunkirk. You looked like your mother.
Carveen. You should not be like your mother. <cf> Because you're an eyesore and I'd like to kill you.
You!
(sighs) Huh.
[--]!　Everyone!　Dodge!
(Noticing) Ha-ha-ha-ha!
[gasps] Ah!
(Noticing) Oh, ......!　Oh, !
You're using human life as a tool. ......
(Look at the exploding enemy) Ahh... ......
It's that way!
Don't let him escape!
Where are you going, you Yugoslav!
...... now the condition of the avaritia shell is ideal. <cf>The foreign object has been taken in, and it is now more likely to run amok.
In other words, it's only hastening the beast's awakening.
Hugo ......!
But you people are trying to stop it. <cf> That is not allowed. It's an unforgivable act.
You alter the past as you wish because it is inconvenient for you. <cf> Don't you think that is selfish?
You who tried to kill Charlotte, you say? <cf> And you even went to the trouble of targeting her when she was a baby.
That is fine, is it not? <cf>It's for the sake of the beast, and by extension, for the cause of saving this planet!
(incredulously) Huh?
You must die for the future, Charlotte.
That's our line!
(Exasperated) Hmph.
(Looking at her escape) Ah!
Let's go.
What, this place ....... It's kind of creepy. ......
Oh, don't you like the [distortion] of space-time? <cf> It's a comfortable space for me, though.
Hugo, I don't know what you're up to. ...... <cf>This is a futile attempt!　This time I won't let you get away!
You people are persistent, aren't you? Shouldn't you <cf>go back in time and help your friends instead of staying in this place?
......I'm beginning to see what you're thinking. <cf>If we go back in time, it will work in your favor, right?
<cf>Well, you're not like [the princess] who took a shortcut. <cf>If they all had that head, the beast would be pleased.
No way. ...... <cf>Every time we jump past, the beast is activated......?
No way. ...... <cf>Every time we leap into the past, the beast is activated......?
Chronoleap is the symbol of an overreaching civilization that <cf>the beast must destroy!
Every time we leap into the past the beast is stimulated and activated. <cf>Avalitya Shell is directly affected by it.
And your friends sink into suffering and despair.
It is you yourselves who are making things worse!
(Upset) ......!
Neither the past nor the future can be changed by you people!
All this is a futile struggle, but do you still want to fight?
Senpai.
Still, we fight.
Still, we will fight!
(Turns around, accepting the avatar's resolve)!
(Turns around, accepting the avatar's resolve.) Hmmm... ......
...... sounds like something a self-deluded hero would say.
I don't know who you are, but ......<cf> apparently you can't just leave it!
Son of man.
You should be honored to be torn apart by the power of the beast. ......
Well, this one is ......
So Voldigen is ......
This is as far as we go.
Kukk...... you fooled me, you ....... <cf>I didn't think such a card would be kept under wraps......
I haven't been this tricky since ......<cf>Adelaide......
What are you mumbling about?
(Spits out a smoke ball from his mouth) Pfft!
Ugh!
(Surprise.) Tsk!
(startled) Ugh!
Don't make a move!
<cf> ...... is just a distraction! <cf> Hugo, where are you going?
(looks around) Uh-uh-uh......<cf>utt-uh-uh......
......It's the forgotten, forgotten Chronogate. <cf>Now there's no one to use ............
What a ......!　Is it not only [mihashira] of [kamigakari]!
'Alicia's Lament' ......
(Suffer!) Gaaaah!
You don't mean to jump, do you!
You'll die from that wound!
What is this!
......We ......beast apostles have ......<cf> this kind of use, too...! ...!
Beast!　[Eat me through my flesh!
(withstand impact) Gugu!
(withstand impact) Gugg!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ......
A-ha-ha-ha-ha!　A-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Despair ...... despair ...... of it all!
What ...... happened ......?
That guy ...... Hugo only works for the beast ......
Go to the [seido] of [tenkei]!　Quick!
Isn't that [utsushimi] he was talking about <cf>Abaritia Shell!
(Realize) Oh, ......!
(impatient) ......!
(Impatiently) Ts!
(Frantic) Ts---ha-ha-ha!
Oh my God!　The avaritia shell!
Suddenly, it started moving! <cf>There was nothing there before, but ......!
(Evilly) Ts--haa!
Hugo!
(startled) Ts, ah!
(Surprise) Ha-ha! ......
(Surprise) ¡h--haa! ......
Car ...... ve, in ......?
(Surprise) Ha......
(Surprise) Ah......
(Surprise) eh......?
Gone...... was......?
That voice ...... of your mother's ......?
(Pick up) Oh!
...... Avaritia Shell, I think it was called.
(Surprise) Oh.
(Surprise) Oh, ha!
That thing is activating the beast.
(Surprise) ......?
Master, you guys are ......!
You've grown up strong, Carveen. <cf> I knew you had the makings of a hero.
...... you, needless to say.
It would be a shame to use the bastard child of hope here, <cf>but[--].
What are you [--]!
I can't move. ......!
Because this is what I'm supposed to do.
Kuha!
(Suddenly able to move.) Ts--!
Now ...... what were you trying to ......
(In pain) ッ......
I see. ...... I see.

But if we don't, the beast will awaken.
The <cf> problem will not be solved without processing the avaritia shell itself!
Processing means ...... master!
The first thing we need to do is find the avaritia shell. <cf>You guys might want to do the same.
...... Well, let's head to the temple to hear what's going on!
But still, it's been <cf>more than a month since the avaritia shell disappeared. ......
Bashlar. Can you hear me? <cf> I need you to look into something for me ASAP.
The avaritia shell has disappeared. <cf>It was the work of someone called "The Beast's Apostle" [--].
Dear ...... ............ only ......... ...............
Bashlar?　What is the matter?
Time ...... disordered ...... positive ...... observation ...... can... .... <cf>......Varsity......le seems to be active...... and ...... ......
Is the space-time disturbance getting worse ......?
Bashlar!　Can't you at least <cf>somehow get a hold of Shell's whereabouts!
I'm sure ...... Le is in that time period ....... <cf>Record...... after this, the dragon tribe got hold of Shell......
Now minute...... this much...... lack of power......forgiveness......<cf>Ali ......Master Ze, ...... with no ...... basket......
No more communication ......
I wonder if <cf>Hugo is still responsible for the activation of the ...... avaritia shell......
It seems that even Bashlar and his team <cf>don't know where the shell is. What should we do now? ......
If my cute ears are not mistaken, <cf>you said the dragon tribe would get Shell.
The Dragon People......Voldigen......
Anyway, let's go to the temple.
I agree. Maybe there is some information there.
We have been searching for God's messenger with all our might since then, <cf>but we have no information to go on.
I've sent a request to the Pioneer Bureau, without giving any details, but ......<cf>nothing at all......
No clue, or ....... <cf>Now, do you have any information related to the dragon tribe?
<cf>About the dragon tribe, we have left it to the Principality of Barnhart. <cf>I should have heard from them by now. ......
...... Actually, I'm already days late. <cf>Maybe something is wrong......
<cf>I thought Carveen was in charge of the dragon people. <cf>Servants, we will go to the principality.
Erinse, will you stay here? <cf> We cannot be sure that Shell will not return.
Yes, sir.
Shall we go then? The sooner we get moving, the better.
Um, please take the main body of the Omnistron this time. <cf>I'll be sufficient as a child unit.
What?　Is that okay?
The space-time disturbance continues. We probably won't be able to contact <cf>Bashlar for a while longer, and ......
If you stay here, you can get information about <cf>Avaritia within Asterlys.
I am rather concerned about <cf>avaritia within the Principality. It could be <cf>shell affected.
Understood. I'll take it if that's what you mean.
The usage is not so different from the ...... child device, but <cf>the location of Avalitia can be estimated by observation of the engrams.
Hou....... <cf>Hmmm...... hmmm......
Okay, I've learned Feste! <cf>Leave it to me with peace of mind!
<cf>By the way, it's an amazing machine once again. <cf>How much will it be worth if I sell it? ......
Please keep a close eye on Mr. Feste. <cf>Never let him cash in his omnistron ......
Yup.
Or do!　Only after it's all over!
Oh ...... haha
......
Well then, have a good day. <cf>Please take care of yourself......
<cf>I'm sorry to bother you so suddenly, but I have a personal matter to discuss with the king. <cf>Could you please intercede for me?
Yes!　<cf>I have heard about you from the Duke. <cf>Please wait a moment.
I am sorry. <cf> I've sent you all the way out here because I was late in getting in touch with you.
No, it is not in our nature to wait. <cf>By the way, [--]
What about Carveen? <cf>I heard he's taking the lead in pursuing the dragon tribe.
...... Actually, he hasn't been back past his scheduled time.
That guy was fixated on the dragon tribe because of the Dunkirk thing. <cf>So, I thought he was the right person to gather information related to the dragon tribe.
And as I expected, while investigating the movements of the dragon tribe side, I found <cf>that dragon who ravaged our country[--].
I heard that he found a connection between Leanbrum and Hugo.
I secretly sent the informant that Hugo used to <cf>track him down</cf>, but he didn't come back. ......
<cf>So he's not coming back? <cf>Then I'll go check it out.
No, this is something that should be handled within the principality. <cf>We will not bother you with this.
You don't want to move <cf>them</cf> too publicly in this matter, do you?
<cf>There may be people who still have Hugo's breath in their veins. <cf>That's why we can't assign troops to the search. ...... no?
......The informant's stronghold <cf>is said to be near the cave of West Barnhardt. Carveen was headed there.
Frankly, I'm glad you guys are here. <cf>I'm asking you to do it for me, okay?
Aah!　Carveen!
Ah!
You are safe, my lord!
Master and his Lord!　Why are you here!
I heard that you could not be reached. <cf> I heard you were chasing an informant who has connections with Hugo. ......
Ah, we caught him just now! <cf> I just asked my men to bring him in.
<cf>Well, you must have been mistaken. <cf>We'll return to the castle as soon as possible.
No, that's [--]
Whoa!　What is it?　<cf> Omnistron is at ......!
Ah!
There's Avaritia nearby: ......!
Oh shit, he's trying to come out!
He ......? <cf>I don't think that's an avaritia shell!
No, no. It's not a shell. <cf> But it's a pretty powerful avaritia.
<cf>When I caught this informant running deep into the cave, <cf>he attacked me.
We managed to get away, but <cf>we can't leave it like that!
Master, please help us!
Okay, okay. Let's go!
<cf> Let's go!
I never thought we'd come all the way here to defeat Avaritia.
It's not like they just show up at any moment. ...... <cf>Maybe it's a Hugo thing. Let's brace ourselves.
There she is!　It's Avaritia!
A formidable opponent! <cf>Master, be careful!
Thank you, Master and his Lord! <cf>I alone had my hands full just keeping him in check!
Totally ....... But why did you informers <cf> run away to this place?
...... They were instructed by Hugo to flee here if they were ever chased by the Principality!
He was told that <cf>Hugo had tamed the monsters here, and that <cf>he would never attack anyone who had anything to do with them.......
<cf>Hugo told him that he could clean up the mess even if he wasn't there. He really has a bad character.
Anyway, we should go back to the castle. Hopefully this informant will lead us to <cf>Abaritia Shell.
What's up?　Carveen.
No, it's nothing. <cf> Let's hurry back to the castle and report to the Lord King.
Welcome back, Carvain. And adventurers. <cf> Capturing the informer and defeating Aberritya was a great cause.
<cf> Don't be so formal about it. <cf> So, did you get anything out of the informant?
Yes, he talked easily. <cf>Hugo's betrayal must have had an effect.
According to the informant, Hugo had his eye on the "Koaniani Forest" before his death.
Koaniani Forest ......?
Is that the place further out from Cape Lawehara? <cf>As I recall, it was the domain of the "forest people," who were famous for their hatred of humans.
That's right. <cf>They are a unique cultural sphere that keeps its distance from both dragon tribes and humans.
<cf>By the way, do you know what lies beyond the Koaniani Forest?
Do not be fooled. That is where the dragon tribe lives. <cf>A land of extreme cold that rejects all living things......!
Yes, it is. Perhaps Hugo was trying to gain <cf>advantage in negotiations with the dragon tribe</cf> by having influence in that land!
The dragon tribes and the forest people have a <cf>non-aggression pact</cf> that says they will never invade each other's territory.
I see. I see. So his inspection of Cape Lawehala was <cf>a foothold for that. ......
....... <cf>Records show that the Dragon Tribe gets the shell: ......
The Dragon Tribe, Yugoslavia, and the Koaniani Forest....... <cf>Worth a trip to check it out.
Glad you found it useful. <cf>We'll continue to gather information on the dragon tribe.
...... Your Majesty. I beg your pardon, but may I have your permission to go to the Koaniani Forest?
Hmm?　What, you want to go with me?
I would like to join you eventually, but ......<cf> I would like to go alone for a little while.
Give me a reason, Carveen.
......I had the same feeling when I visited Cape Lawehara before, <cf>I feel like I know that land!
The Koaniani Forest also seems to be in my memory ....... <cf>And most of all, Yugoslavia has my mother ......
I have a feeling that ...... Avaritia Shell may be ...... my missing<cf> mother!
Huh?　What are you saying [--]?
I'm still not sure. <cf>But ...... that's why I want to be sure.
......Good. I'll allow it. <cf>You should cherish the instincts of those who stand on the battlefield.
Your Majesty,......!
Master!　I will definitely join you later! <cf>I will definitely help you, so please wait a moment!
All right, we're going back to the temple in Asterlys. <cf>If you want to know about the people of the forest, ask Lalaforte!
Aberritya Shell ...... No, I know where the [mitsuka]i <cf> might be!
The Koaniani Forest!
Koaniani Forest......?
...... I see. Then it's no wonder that our cult's information network didn't catch it.
The forest people living there hate humans. <cf>It would be troublesome if there is an ambassador there.
<cf>It's only a possibility, though. <cf>But for now, I want to be sure of any information.
I understand. The Order will do everything we can to assist you.
Get Lalaforte here as soon as possible!
I flew here when I heard it was my turn! <cf>I've heard what's going on, so don't worry about it.
<cf>I think that if you are going to explore the Koaniani Forest, contact with the forest people is inevitable.
If you want to go meet them, I will guide you!
...... but I am an exile from [the township (sato)], so <cf>I can really only show you the way.........
That's enough. Thank you.
That's enough. Thank you.
Yes, I can!　Leave it to me!
Well, I'll leave first. <cf>I'll check things out over there.
We'll meet up in Jubilia later.
Erinze, you are to [--]
You [--] stay here. I understand. <cf>We don't even know what's going on in Voldigen.
...... I wish <cf>I had as much strength to fight as you all!
...... sorry
...... sorry
No, it's my own selfishness. <cf>I am sorry before I leave.
I will take good care of your absence. <cf>Please take care, everyone!
Thank you for your hard work!
Mm, thank you for your hard work! <cf>Did you see anything unusual?
...... As a bit of a curiosity, <cf>I heard a sighting of what seemed to be a dragon tribe!
They saw a dragon flying over the Koaniani Forest, <cf>they saw shadows in the forest that looked like dragon people, and they heard sounds of fighting. ......
Didn't the forest people and the dragon tribe have a non-aggression pact?
Yes, but I don't think the villagers were lying. But I don't think the villagers' stories are false. <cf>And [--].
Actually, some of the forest people do trade with<cf>humans for a living.
But I hear that some of them have recently <cf>cut off that deal<cf>. ......
Muuu...... because of the appearance of the dragon tribe? <cf> Or is it something to do with the avaricious shells......
At any rate, let's enter the Koaniani Forest first!
This is the "Koaniani Forest". <cf>This is the area where the forest people have lived since ancient times.
[It is a forest that has maintained its independence since ancient times, and has been preserved in its natural state.
Oh, my beautiful home! <cf> Come, let's go together...
<cf>Well, I could use a little omnistron. <cf>Maybe we'll find something.
Oh, there's a response!　Is this deep in the forest ......? <cf>That's an extraordinarily strong Engram reaction. ......
Oh, what is it?　What's wrong?
No, nothing. <cf> I was just sorting through some information.
I see. <cf> Is there anything I can help you with?
Yes, ....... <cf>You are familiar with the topography here, aren't you?
In terms of a map, I'd like to know about this area: ......
Which one?　Well, ...... this is the place called ......<cf> "The Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits", isn't it?
What about this place?
Maybe <cf> there's an avaritia shell here.
Eh! <cf>If that's true, it could get a little messy: ......
<cf>I need the permission of the Queen of the People of the Forest to go to the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits"!
Queen or ...... where is she?
Deep in the Koaniani Forest,......<cf> in a forest people's settlement called Ululau.
But the Queen of the forest hates humans more than most forest people. Don't forget that ......
......?　I hear something ......
Sound?　I don't hear anything. ......
...... beware!
...... right there, it's coming!
Dragon tribe!
Is it <cf> true that dragon tribes are invading the Koaniani Forest?
After all, this is where the avaritia shells are [--].
I knew it, there's an avaritia shell here.
Hmm?
Who are you ......? <cf> How can you stand up to that dragon tribe? ......
Kapakuku!
......, hmm?
Lalaforte!　You ......!
Do you know ......?
Yes, I do. He's my childhood friend, and he's the gatekeeper of <cf>Urlau [Township]!
......Has your throat been healed?
If he hadn't, he wouldn't have had to go back to the cult, <cf> he's an idiot.
Why did you show up again?　I told you we can't let the outcasts anywhere near <cf>the township</cf>.
...... And this time you brought a human with you.
I apologize for bringing a human. <cf>But it's an emergency!
Actually, it seems that a dangerous avaritia that the Order had sealed up has escaped to the <cf>"Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits".
These people came to catch it <cf>before it can do any damage</cf>.
They said that the dragon tribe is also after that avaritia. <cf>That's why they are breaking the [ancient] pact and invading!
Dangerous Avaritia ......? <cf>No way, that's ......
The ...... of the Divine Spirit
Oy!　Who's there!
Ha!
huh?
What's that sound?
...... It's not good if the other foresters see us. Let's change the location.
Take these guys and come to my hideout. Okay?
Let's go to Kapakuk's hideout. If we don't <cf>convince him, the gatekeeper, we won't be able to enter [the township], let alone meet the queen!
Don't worry. He may look scary at first glance, but <cf>he is a good and compassionate person!
Besides, [--]
When push comes to shove, I'll take advantage of being a childhood friend and attack him with embarrassing stories from my childhood.
Hmmm...
There you are. The others didn't see you, did they?
You're the ones Lalaforte brought in. <cf>I'll spare you the face of my childhood friend and at least tell you a story.
...... was it a few years ago? <cf>Avaritia took up residence near [township].
He ravaged the area around [the township]. <cf>Of course, he tried several times to send out a strike team, but the queen stopped him.
For some reason, the queen stopped them. <cf>She said we shouldn't take chances with people we don't know who they are.
(A few years ago? <cf>This is not the right time for an avaritia shell. ......?)
That all changed recently. <cf>An even greater monster has emerged, one that even Avalitia can follow.
More monsters?
Oh, yes. [The people of this township call it "Shinrei" (divine spirit) with a sense of awe.
After that spirit appeared, the avaritia that had been ravaging the township became completely quiet.
That divine spirit, if it is ......
Of course, there are those like me who are wary of divine spirits.
But most of us are fascinated by the spirit with <cf>avaritia</cf> in tow.
If we talk about handing it over to a human, even a fool can see that <cf>that's not going to happen for free,......
...... If that divine spirit is the avaritia <cf>shell</cf> we are looking for, then the situation is even more troublesome than we thought.
I didn't realize that there was a three-way war between us, the dragon tribe, <cf>and the forest people over the Avalitha Shell. ......
[--]?　Quiet!
Kapakuk...... this......
Someone is approaching the [sato]. I have to go check it out.
Let me help. <cf>Wouldn't it be better to have some manpower?
I'll help. <cf>We'd better have manpower, wouldn't we?
...... if you see anything unusual, report it to me right away. <cf>Don't slow me down, okay?
Man there!　I will not tolerate any further intrusion!
You're forest people!
You ......?　Are you ......?
Are you ......?　You are ......
Carvein!
Oh ...... master!
You're Carveen? ......!
Wait, Kapakuk!　He's not a bad guy! <cf> He's a knight of the Duchy of Barnhart who's researching the dragon tribe!
Master Carveen, I <cf>did not expect to see you here. Are you here to investigate?
Oh, no, that's one thing, but ....... <cf> I'm here on a personal matter.
Oh, by the way, you said you <cf>remember</cf> the Koaniani Forest.
Yeah, it's kind of oddly nostalgic. <cf>It's as if I used to live here. ......
...... you, does the name Adelaide ring a bell?
[--]¡ª　That was my mother's name!
I knew you were Adelaide's child! <cf> No wonder you look so much like her.
Do you know my mother? <cf>I think I vaguely recognize your face. ......
Well, ...... she was a turning point person in many ways. <cf>I only stayed in [the township] for a short time, but I remember
Adelaide, it was a strong warrior. <cf>I admired him as a child [--].
...... and what happened to that Adelaide?
Did ...... he die?
......Capakuk, O Kapakuk. If you say that you <cf>know</cf> Adelaide, then we can talk quickly.
That thing you call a divine spirit could be Carveen's mother ......<cf>Adelaide.
After all, is there an avaricious shell here?
<cf>I have not yet confirmed with my own eyes whether that which the foresters call a divine spirit is really a shell.
Is that Adelaide ......?　That's absurd ......
Please, let the people of the forest help us! <cf>I need to know if that's my mother!
If it really is my mother, I know why she showed up here. <cf>Maybe it was a memory of being sheltered here in the past......
......The Divine Spirit is at the back of the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits". <cf>I need our queen's permission to enter there.
If you guys are willing to cooperate with me, I can take you to see our queen in <cf>[SATO].
Oh!　That's a step in the right direction!
But you'll need to qualify for that.
Ah, I understand! <cf>"Baptism in the Woods", right?　Right?
I'm going back to [township] to report on the dragon tribe. <cf>As for the baptism, ask Lalaforte.
Let's talk about the details at Kapakuk's hideout. <cf>After your baptism, you will be able to enter the [hometown]!
Now, let me explain <cf>"baptism in the forest" as Kapaq said.
Baptism in the forest is a ceremony that has been handed down from the forest people since ancient times, and <cf>those who are baptized are allowed to enter the township.
It is easy to do. At the end of the road to the southwest from here, go to the <cf>"Hanameguri no Komura," or the "flower garden," and go to the "Hana-meguri" or "flower garden.
and get the "star flower" that blooms at the far end of the tree. <cf>[--] That's all.
A star flower? <cf>......What kind of feature is it?
You will soon find out. <cf>It is a shiny purple flower.
It is said that the star flower can only be obtained by those who fight the guardians who protect it and are <cf>approved</cf>!
...... I know it's a lot of work, but I'm sure <cf>you</cf> will be fine, as the God of Buffalia has granted it to you!
Let's go, Master. We must <cf>get it as soon as possible, considering the dragon tribe!
Is there a starflower in the back here that we need for the baptism of the forest? ......
Is that what protects the star flowers? <cf>Be careful, my servant!
This color, it is definitely a starflower! <cf>So, my brave oracle...
Now let us go and report to Kapakuk. <cf>He is always at the entrance of the village!
You got the star flower?
Hmmm, okay. <cf> I will recognize you as those who have been baptized in the forest.
In the name of Kapakguk the Keeper, <cf> I grant you permission to enter the village.
<cf> but only to enter the forest. <cf> To go to the place where the spirits are, you must have the queen's permission.
I will accompany you when you go to the mansion of our queen, Pipimaruka-sama. <cf>Are we clear?
Lalaforte, you are ......
I know. I'm an outcast.
I can only help you so far.
May the Gods of Buffalia bless you all.
...... Let's go. We're wasting time.
This is the Queen's mansion. <cf>Master Pipimarca is on the top floor.
Listen, please don't be too rough with him. <cf> Here we go.
<cf> I have come to offer my congratulations to those who have been baptized in the forest.
How ...... is one of them a child of Adelaide? <cf> I think his name is Carveen.
Yes, sir! <cf>I am honored that you remember me!
<cf>You were very young when you fled here, pursued by someone......<cf>.
Adelaide hoped that her wounded husband would recover, <cf>but in the meantime, you have saved us so well.
Because of your mother, <cf>we have learned to have faith in people.
Ah!
...... But I understand that it was only because <cf> it was Adelaide!
The other two are [--].
Subhuman. That's a very unusual "type".
And you are [--].
...... a [piece] of hope, a fragment of a wish ...... or ......
Let me ask you the purpose of your visit here.
The forest was baptized, and Kapakuk, the watchman, recognized it. <cf> Then I guess you are not a harmful person [--].
...... people are not to be trusted.
They have come to inform [SATO] of the danger.
With all due respect, I would like to advise you, Queen Pipimarca.
What you call divine spirits are very dangerous.
Therefore, they have been captured by the Order of Buffalia and are under strict control.
Oh, ........!
You idiot!
...... The Order of Buffalia?
I see, you have a connection to the Order.
[We have a connection, yes, but we're not a...
Oooh... ......!
No, we are not! <cf> We are working for a different reason than the Order!
Whatever the reason, if it has anything to do with the Order,<cf> we will not listen to you!
Master Phi Phi Malka! <cf>They have come to tell us of the dangers of the Divine Spirit!
<cf>Thanks to the presence of the Divine Spirit, <cf>that avaritia has grown quiet!
<cf>Now I will not tolerate anyone who tries to unintentionally break this silence, even if they are Adelaide's children!
Queen!　That spirit is the spirit of my mother, Adelaide.
Refrain, mortal!
Refrain, mortal!
...... I will allow you to come and go as you please in this land. <cf> You may thank the baptism of the forest and Adelaide.
<cf> But I will not allow you one step closer to the Spirit. <cf>I will give you food for the forest when you break the prohibition.
Ugh......
Oh ......
<cf>Get back with them, Kapaguk. <cf> I don't even want to see your face for a while.
...... Let's go. We can't let this happen.
......
You fool! <cf>Master Pipimarca hates the Order!
Didn't Lalaforte tell you that! <cf>He was expelled from [SATO] because of that, you know?
Sorry, my fault. ...... <cf> What an idiot, slack-jawed moron and fool I am!
It's true, totally. <cf>I thought if I had an adelaide kid, I'd be ......
<span size="Big">Punch me! </>
Hit me as hard as you can! <cf>I'd feel better if you didn't!
No, not that much [--].
Hit me as hard as you want, cuss me out and hit me as hard as you want!　Please!
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?
But what can we do? <cf> They say you can't go to a place where there are divine spirits without the queen's permission.
......I know what you guys are capable of. <cf>All that remains is whether you are ready to wield that power.
If you wish to obtain the divine spirit, then a battle with the <cf>avaritia</cf> that follows will be inevitable.
And moreover, I hear that they are competing with the dragon tribe for the divine spirit. <cf>We can't waste any more time, can we?
...... I see. <cf>So you are saying that we should give up the queen's permission and use force?
I don't think we have time to hesitate.
......What shall we do?
......Let's do it.
I have received your resolve. Then I'll let you meet my people.
But never mention that you've met my people. <cf>To Lalaforte, too.
<cf>Come to "Kazemi's Heights," east of the Koaniani Forest. <cf>There ...... are my people.
Who are these guys?
I told you.　[I'll take you to my people. <cf>A few of them are here: ......
Commonly known as the "Defeatists". These are comrades who want to defeat Avaritia and the Divine Spirit and restore peace to the <cf> forest.
Defeat ......?
Originally, we were dissatisfied with the Queen's decision. <cf>Why not defeat that avaritia by force?
I don't care if there are sacrifices to be made. <cf>The damage that guy can do is more than that.
But the queen remains reluctant to ...... for any length of time. <cf>At the end of the day, she's clinging to a spirit that suddenly appeared.
We don't want ambiguity.
<cf>If he's quiet now thanks to the spirit, <cf>we can't let this opportunity pass us by.
The queen is more than a little disturbed by the audience she just had. <cf>The time to seize the opportunity is now.
First, our friends from the defeatist faction will make a commotion in the vicinity of [the township].
While they are there, we will raid the "graveyard of the ancestral spirits.
But in order to get to the "Ancestral Grave", we have to go through the "Tuonela Road".
First, we need to get to the entrance.
Apparently, our friends are doing well. <cf>Now, [SATO]'s attention is on you.
Don't let this opportunity pass you by. Let's go!
If we pass through this approach, we'll reach the "Ancestral Grave.
There's no time to waste!　Hurry!
Stop!
...... Something's coming!
Oh!
Oh, ......
The dragon tribe ......!
They've come to take the Avalitia Shell, huh?
Hmmm, the Avalitia Shell is just up ahead. <cf>You've chosen a very picturesque place.
What?
Oh no......
Oops~......
As a courtesy to warriors, let me state my name. My name is Erniges. <cf> I am a servant and ally of the Dragon King Voldigen.
What courtesy, you lamebrains! <cf> Have you forgotten our ancient pact of mutual inviolability?
Say it, say it!
For that I apologize, people of the forest. <cf> It is not in accordance with my will that I should [mis]make a promise!
...... but if it is for the sake of our friends, <cf> and by extension, our people, then we have no choice!
Are you the people Leenblum was talking about?
I hear that Hrelbe was killed by you. <cf>Even Vordigen was forced to deal with you. ......
<cf>As a warrior of the dragon tribe, there is no better opponent. <cf> Let's see if we can make a move!
Nnghhhh!
Beeaaaah!
Aah!
Ah!
Hm!
Yoruk ......?
...... Ma
That's him!　It's Avaritia, the one who's been trolling [the township]!
Mmm...... hmm!
Giaaaaah!
Ma ...... ah, ah!
[--]Hmph! [--]Hmph!
Oww!
[--]Hmph!　...... aaaaah!
Ma...... ah, ah ah ah!
I see the sign of this guy ....... <cf>I leave the babysitting to you guys.
I'll leave the babysitting to you guys!
Oh, ......
Oh ...... ts!
Maaaaah~~!
...... This is our chance to take him down. We can't let this opportunity pass us by.
Let's get to work!
Mwah~~!
Maaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Maaaaaaaaaaah!
We're going after him!　We'll fold up at once!
Hold your feet. Rebels!
ah!
Ahh!
Lalaforte!
I'll be back! ......
Whatever you have broken the prohibition, your childhood friends are dear to you, are they not?
You are the ones who caused the ruckus, aren't you?
Your friends are in jail. <cf> Rest assured. They are not dead yet.
Oh ......ts......
<cf>You are not dead yet!
If you disobey my orders any longer, <cf> you will have to pay a suitable price!
Kuk......!
This is not the time for internal strife, my queen!
The dragon tribe is coming for the divine spirit! <cf>If we don't do something, they will take the spirit away from us!
<cf>Go to the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits" and check on them. <cf>About that Abaritia, too!
The spirit is a calamity that calls for battle!
You and Avaritia must be defeated!
...... of all people, you are the [leader] of the vanquishing faction!
Queen Pipimarca declares. <cf>Kapakku is now relieved of his guardianship and banished.
<cf> You are guilty of the same crime!
You are equally guilty. <cf> You shall leave this [country] with Kapaguk!
Pipimalka-sama!
If you do not obey [--]!
Don't do it!
...... obey. So ......
I'm sorry ....... You guys follow me too.
Oh, ......
<cf>I'll send word to your friends. <cf>Afterward, I will send word to your friends.
I'm going to send you some more news about your friends.
Ah...... ah...... ah!
You will not be able to defeat Avaritia, the protector of the Divine Spirit,<cf> and on top of that, you will take Lalaforte as hostage,......
Before reaching the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits,"<cf>the queen of the forest people was completely turned into an enemy,......

<cf>Gunuunuuu is getting worse and worse. <cf>I'm going to borrow Kapakuku's hideout.
The situation is bad. Now let's see how we can overturn it from here: ......
First, we need to rescue Lalaforte [--].
Oh, folks! <cf>I knew you were here!
Lalaforte!　Why you! <cf>You escaped?
My queen released me <cf>right after Kapakuk and the others left!
What the <cf>......? <cf> Damn it!　You're licking us!
I don't think that's ...... right.
What do you mean?
I don't mean to take you hostage, but I don't think JoOusama meant to <cf>hurt</cf> me.
I thought it was a bad idea at first, but <cf>they were polite the whole time they treated me. Besides, [--]
When I was going to release ...... her, she whispered to me. <cf>["]I'm sorry for making you feel horrible["]......
Would you normally say that to someone you were going to kill<cf>?
As a queen, you don't want to protect <cf>the divine spirit</cf> by hurting your people......?
I want to protect the divine spirit that makes the ...... mysterious avaritia mature. <cf>But not to the point of hurting the people.
But we will not allow the mysterious avaritia that is hurting the people to be touched<cf>at all......
I'm not sure what you mean by that.
...... It's as if they are protecting <cf>Avalitya</cf> by using the divine spirit as a shield!
...... there must be a reason for this.
<cf>Let's first find out what the queen is really up to. <cf>Is there anyone she knows well?
...... then I know just the person for you!
Could it be ......
Harao Kava Aku. <cf>The only one who has known Master Pipimaruka since he was a child.
I knew it! <cf>Eh, that thing [_~~]?　You're going to talk to that thing [～～～～]?
I don't have a choice!　That's the only thing I can think of.
She's not very happy about it, is she?
...... Well, what the hell. You'll understand when you see him.
Hara lives alone in the "Hot Swamp of Yomiuri". <cf> It's dangerous, but I'm sure you guys will be fine.
I'll go ahead and do my [semi][preparation]. <cf>You guys come after.
Lalaforte, you go back to the cult. <cf>If you get caught again, there's no point.
......Yes, that's right. I will. <cf>I don't want to drag everyone down any further.
Kapakuk is right, I will go back to the Order. <cf>If I can be of any help, please give me a shout!
Oh, yes!　Whenever you talk to Hara-ro, please make sure to <cf>add 'sama' to your name. It's "Sama"!
Is there such a thing as a person around here ......?
I don't have a choice. Let's ask him.
Hey, is there anyone around here named Haraou Kava Aku?
...... Po-Po?
Po-?
...... What did you just say, my dear?
Huh?　Well, I said, <cf> Is there a person called Haraou Kava Aku around here?　I said, ......
You should put on a "様を付ける,"[----] you pretentious bastard!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Wow. ......
～～～～!
Nnnn [------]!
Pop-pop!　They are so rude! <cf>That's outrageous to call them by their names when you first meet them!
No, we are ....... <cf> Hm?　Calling them names?
Yes, that's right!　I am the very great, great, great <cf>Hara-roo kava akupo!
This is...!　You're lying!
It's not a lie. It's true.
It has been a while. Dear Haraou Kava Aku. <cf> We apologize for the rudeness of our people.
Are they one of yours?　You have no discipline! <cf>That's why young people these days!
You are right to be angry. <cf>I hope this will calm them down. ......
This is my favorite "Nappo's Delicious Water"! <cf>You know what I mean!
(...... Hey, what's that? <cf> Are you really on friendly terms with the Queen?)
(Oh, no doubt. (<cf>Master Pipimaruka, I hear, has been coming here often since he was a child.)
(...... Nobody likes to come to an old bigot's place. <cf> I guess it was a good escape for Master Pipimarca.)
Dear Kava Aku. I would like to <cf>please allow me to ask you a question, since you have such a generous heart.
Mm, I forgive you. What do you want to ask me?
......It's about your thoughts, Mr. Pipimaruka. <cf>What does he think and what does he want to do now? ......
......I see. <cf>I didn't know that was the case: ......
Do you have any idea?
...... Give us a minute. <cf>I want to be prepared to tell others about his situation without permission.
<cf>You can come to the "Garden of the Great Sages" later. <cf>By that time, I will be ready to do the same. ......
......Well, I don't know where to begin.
[<cf>It was many years ago. <cf>The Buffarian cult had approached the people of the forest.
At the time, the Pipimarca were very active in their interactions with the outside world. <cf>They said, "If we don't do this, we will be left behind by the times.
Then came the Order. <cf>Pipimarca gladly accepted a priest[--].
...... and so they fell in love in secret.
Ha!　The queen!　With a human!
You see, because of reactions like yours, <cf>Pipimaruka could not make their relationship public.
Even though she is trying her best to fulfill her role as queen, <cf>she is also a woman in love. She used to come here to flirt.
Eventually, they had a child together. <cf>Her name was Lulmana, and she was a lovely girl.
But after a while, the child disappeared from Pipimarca with the priestess.
Only the child returned a few years ago. <cf>...... as Abaritia.
I had heard that they had been <cf>experimenting</cf> before the Avalitia shell showed up, but not <cf>before this long......
So that's what you mean. <cf>So, that figure is still [--].
Like Yoruk, <cf>was he made into a pseudo-avaritia experimental subject? ......
...... Pipimarca soon realized that <cf> Avaritia was my child!
But he could not let the people know. <cf>It was a secret love, after all.
My child is still my child, even if she is Avaritia. I cannot tell anyone. <cf>But as queen, I must protect my people.
Pipimarca was left with only <cf>checks and balances, which were said to be lax. ......
...... I see. For Pipimarca, <cf>the divine spirit that would appease my child was truly a god. ......
Betrayed by the man she loved, and <cf>turned into avaritia</cf> by the child she loved, she still could not escape her kingly duties. Still, I could not escape the duties of a king. ......
Ale has suffered alone for <cf> so long, between the board of a queen and a woman.
In truth, he is a very kind and whiny guy. <cf>...... I wish I could save him!
But how can I ......
There is a way to free Avaritia's soul.
Erinze can do it. <cf>But I don't know if I can bring her in under the circumstances. ......
I'll go get her as an escort. Erinse is in the temple in <cf>Asterlys, isn't she?
Erinse ....... He is the one who can save the souls of Lady Pipimarca and <cf> her daughter?
...... I understand. Then I am willing to help. <cf>When he comes to the forest, I will do my best to protect him with my friends.
Now ....... <cf>We'll go back to the hideout and get ready for anything.
<cf>Thanks for your help. <cf>Let me take care of Mr. Erlinse.
<cf>I'll take care of Erinse. <cf>An unknown adventurer and a very old, catty girl.
Who's the older one, you old bastard?
I had no idea that the mysterious Abaritia was the son of Pipimaruka. <cf> How could I have done that without knowing it? ......
<cf>I hear that those who become avaritiyas are cut off from this world and wander forever.
...... I wish I could at least give <cf>their souls</cf> a good night's sleep!
The forest is frightened ......!
Oh my goodness!
Kapakuku! <cf>The dragon tribe has invaded in earnest!
What the hell?
They really want to take away the spirit of the gods!　If they continue on like this and even <cf>Vordigen</cf> comes out, it's not good!
The king of the dragon tribe eats Avaritia to power. <cf>If the queen's daughter is eaten, there's no way to save her!
<cf>Hurry to the "Graveyard of the Ancestral Spirits! <cf>We can force our way through the approach!
Yes! ......! ......
Let's go!　We've got to hold out until Carveen comes <cf> with Erinse</cf>!
What the hell is going on? ......
Hey!　Report the situation!
Kapaqq!　Oh, you ......! <cf> You came all the way here without permission [--]!
Now is not the time to be talking like that! <cf>The dragon tribe must be attacking us!
Ah, ah, you fought off some of them, but <cf>you said you couldn't stop the leader dragon......
Not good!　It's Erniges!
What about Lady Pipimarca!
Ho, he went to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits" with other soldiers [--].
Shit!　It's an emergency! Coming through!
The approach road runs through at once! <cf> Let's hurry to the "Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits"!
Hn, nn, aye, hn, ts, hn!
Woah, woah, woah - ahhhh, woah, woah!
It is dangerous!　Please step back!
Mamaaaa~!
Mnh!
Gah!
Hmph!
Run away!　Run away!
Ma, ma....... Guard ......
No!　Your mother is [--]!
Uhu......
Kya～～～～～!
Huh?
You......
Dear Pipimarca. <cf> Forgive me for breaking the prohibition and being here!
Huff, tz, hnnn, hnn
Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.
I heard all about it from the original elder. <cf> That is ...... your ......
Huzzah!
Ts......!
Hu...... hu....... Well, they know. <cf>Good, I forgive you. Laugh and curse!
<cf> For a woman who takes her own child over her people is <cf> no fit consort for a king!
<cf> No one blames her for being a mother before the king. <cf>No, who can blame her?
You have been strong, but this is as far as you will go.
No!　You will lose your avaritia shell!
Master!
Here you are!
Oh, Carveine and Erlinse!
Oh, Carveen and Erinse!
I have heard what is happening. I know the art of avaritiya and the art of releasing the soul that has been transformed into <cf>.
May I use it on your ...... daughter?
Even if her body cannot be restored,......<cf>at least give her soul some peace,......
I'll take care of it here.
Erinse, please.
Erinse, please.
Oh. I will protect her in the name of the Keeper......
Come on, master!　To the Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits!
Ma...... Ma......
...... I will let you meet your real mother!
Mama......
Oh ...... damn it ......
Lulu Mana~!
Here we are!　Your mother is here!
Mama ......?
Huh......! Tz...... ugh...... ugh......
...... Finally, I got to meet you!
I'm sorry I couldn't do anything ......<cf> for you. ......
I love you, ...... mom!
I love you so much! ...... ugh......
U......Ah, ah......!
Ohhhh～～～～～......
'The Cemetery of the Ancestral Spirits' ...... Here is the Divine Spirit ......!
Hurry up, servant. <cf> We cannot let the dragon tribe take it from us!
<cf>Wait!
Hm?
Very well. <cf>If our goals are the same, it is only fitting that we end this by force.
For a warrior, <cf>[a battle with the strong] is irreplaceable. ......
Come with all your might! <cf>Show me the power that shook Voldigen!
Hey!　You're safe!
Avaritia has been released. <cf>I hope this clears the queen's mind a little. ......
...... It's all right. <cf>Master Pipimarca, we'll support you.
Come on, let's go. The spirit is back here.
Aah!
What do you mean?
Stupid ......! <cf>When I saw it, it was a huge monster!
It's being fused with the ...... avaricious shell!
Ah......
Wait a minute!　Avaritia Shell is ......<cf> what about my mother!
Or ...... my mother ......?
That could be my mom! <cf>Please, tell me!
Maybe, just maybe,......
...... if the fusion continues, I'm not a nobody, <cf> I thought I'd become an uncontrollable 'something'......!
Mother!　Wake up, please!
Ugh!
Tsk ...... huh ...... huh ...... huh ...... huh ...... huh ......
The Imagine Seed!
Mother!
I am Carveen!　I'm your son!
Car......ve......n......? I, ......
Yes, Mom!　It's me!
You are Carvein's mother! <cf>Please let Tillis go!
Mother, please!　That man is one of us!
Huh----
Sen ...... pai ......?
Oh.
Oh!
Ahh......
Oh, oh!
Ah ......!
Ah!
Ahh--!　You......
What's that?　What is it?
Whoa!
Huh!
Aaah!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Ugh!　What?
What in the world is ............
......ッ......アァァ......ッツ
Oh......Ah!
I ask you to do the rest, my fellow countrymen. <cf>The future of our dragon tribe,...... please,......
You did a good job for an old man!
I'm not sure I've ever seen you do that before!
Ah......
Hm......
You fought well for your life!
Your work is food for Master Voldigen. <cf>Please be at peace, [compatriot] Erniges.
Are you guys ......?
Hm.
Hey, Avuninthe. <cf> Can I eat them?
Ah!
Ahh!
Hmph.
No, Ulgarum. We must <cf>give this to Lord Voldigen as soon as possible!
Hmm...
Oh, ......!
Phew.
Well, I'm in a hurry, so I'll leave you to it.
......! ......
Hahahahaha!

Voldigen!
It seems that everyone has returned to Ullau. <cf> We're going back too!
Hey! <cf>I hear activity from across the sea!
<cf> I can't wait to get back to work. <cf>Adventurer's business is one thing, but ......
<cf>I'd like to make the Coin Pavilion business <cf>More Big</cf>!
For a happy future with Mewry, <cf>we need to make sure we have a solid foundation for our lives.
We need to develop new customers and goods. <cf>We should also seriously consider Plan, our second store: ......
If the <cf>shell affects Avaritia within the Principality of Barnhart, we'll be in trouble.
I'm also concerned about Mr. Carveen. ...... <cf>I think it's important to check on him.
I'll be here in case the shell comes back.
I hope you find Omnistron useful. <cf>Please be careful.
The guy from Carveine is still headed to investigate the <cf>cave on the "Stahl Coast".
'Zelma Mine Ruins' ......, I think it was. <cf>I hear it involves an informant with connections to Yugoslavia.
We can't search too openly. <cf>I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but I need your help.
Koaniani Forest, where the forest people live?
I've only been as far as the neighborhood. <I only know that it is a forest that has been protected since ancient times.
I'm sure there will be new adventures awaiting us. <cf>I'd go with you if things were the same as they used to be.
<cf>Take care and go. <cf>I'll be looking forward to hearing about your souvenirs.
Ahead is the "Granville Ice World," the home of the dragon tribe. <cf>You need the queen's permission to pass through here.
If you don't have permission, <cf>we can't let you through.
The divas continue to refine their <cf>offerings</cf> in the temple.
It will be difficult for them to see you freely for a while.
It is a burden for them, but it is also for the sake of God. <cf>Let them give themselves to us.
Tirith...... I hope everything is all right. ......
Even if it is in any form, just being in sight <cf>is one thing that makes me feel safe!
You can find star flowers in the "Hanamegu" area. <cf> First of all, you must go there.
It is located in the southern part of the "Silent Forest", so <cf>please use the "Marae Wetlands" as a landmark.
I will follow you! <cf> Don't worry, the forest is on the side of the righteous.
Walk away. <cf> Master Pipimarca is not pleased.
<cf> I'm surprised at you, you live so long. <cf> I didn't know there was a way to save Avaritia.
The help is coming from out of the forest. ...... <cf>We should know more about what's out there!
You can rest assured. The forest will accept you.
Will Erinse and the others save Lulmana? <cf> Then there is no reason to refuse them.
No matter how old you are, no matter how much of a cat you are, <cf>I trust everything to you!
Oh, by the way, Kapakuk told me that when you <cf>released</cf> the queen's daughter, is it true that her pre-life form appeared?
Yes, it is true. It was the first time I had ever seen such a phenomenon.
Perhaps the <cf> soul is different in avaritiyas and pseudo-avaritiyas!
If you defeat an avaritia without releasing its soul, <cf>the avaritia will revive over time.
But pseudo-avaritia is ......<cf>probably ......, but that feeling is ......
If you defeat it without releasing it, it will not revive<cf>and like any other monster, it will remain ......
Considering that, the fact that you were able to free your daughter's soul and <cf>let her see her mother at the end of her life[--].
It was one saving grace. ...... I agree.
I didn't think that the assimilation of Tirith and Shell was <cf>that far along......
In that state, it would have been a hindrance to Voldigen's <cf> ambitions.
It is not Tirith that needs me, but me.
The dragon tribe will probably try to contact me. <cf>Thereby, I will have to jump into their bosom.
That may be our best chance<cf> to get Tirith back.
Damn you, you dragon tribe! ...... <cf>How far will you go to trample on my precious people......!
Master, I can't take it anymore. <cf>I will not forgive you even if you are the Dragon King!
I will be with you when you fight the dragon tribe!
I will get Tirith and her mother back for sure. <cf>I won't let anyone do what they want anymore!
<cf>Amazingly, God's [mitsuka] messenger is now in the hands of the dragon tribe. ...... <cf>As usual, they are fearless!
<cf> But, left? <cf> That queen's daughter is ......
No, I did not know the details of the situation. <cf>I do not wish to cause unnecessary friction with the people of the forest.
<cf>I would be pleased if this opportunity improves the relationship between the Order and the forest people.
In the end, we were left to the mercy of the dragon tribe. ...... <cf>I am sorry. We brought this on ourselves.
You fought for the forest, and <cf>we could do nothing to repay you.
The spirit must be returned to you. <cf>I will not let the dragon tribe have their way any longer.
I'm going to the border of the Granville Ice World. <cf>I will be able to find out more or less what the dragon tribe is up to.
For the sake of your people, <cf>let us do what we can!
Finally, we were able to put that boy to sleep. <cf>This is all thanks to you. I thank you.
I was a poor mother, but <cf>I'm glad I got to see her face one last time. ......
You are a friend of the forest and a benefactor of this pipimarca. <cf>I promise to repay this favor one day!
<cf>May you not be discouraged by hardship. <cf> Keep your eyes unclouded and follow the path you should take.
<cf> The commotion in the forest seems to have subsided. <cf>Thanks to the good work you have done.
From now on, as friends of the forest, <cf>you may visit us at any time.
I, the great one, <cf>may</cf> also make a special visit to you!
Oh, and don't forget to bring a souvenir? <cf>There is such a thing as courtesy in the midst of familiarity!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Did you hear ......?
That ......<cf>I don't want you guys to know.
Someday, when I get more confident, <cf>I'll show it off properly.
I'm sure you'll be able to find a good one.
What? ...... Did the dragon tribe take it from you?
Granville Ice World", the world where the dragon tribe lives......<cf>is a very cold place......
Good work. You want to take a break too?
I was just looking at the ocean.
There's a continent that far out there, ......<cf> and that's where Lalaforte's hometown is.
I was looking for my hometown too, or my parents. <cf>I didn't think it was in the future.
It's not so much across the ocean...... as it is across the sky. <cf>Much, much farther away.
Come to think of it, you're searching for your own memories<cf> too, aren't you?
I wonder if your hometown is far away too.
I wish I could remember the past. <cf>Whenever there's anything I can do for you, just let me know.
Phew~!　I knew I knew this!
Oh, what a coincidence here.
<cf>Aster tropical dead bomb flavor</cf> is what you're after, too?
It's a new one that just came out, and it goes down your throat like a champ! <cf>It's like a body engram!
I sing for offerings during the day and study at night. <cf>I need to relax like this every once in a while!
Well, I'll buy another bottle!
Oh, that's right. Since you're here, I'll buy you a bottle. <cf>Will you have a drink with me?
I'd like to thank you for all you do for me. <cf>I hear you've been working hard too.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a chat to let off steam? <cf>Make me work for it once in a while, okay?
What happened since then? <cf>Go to Kava Aku's place: ......
I told you to put a 'sir' on it! <cf>All you have to do is flatter me.
Well, I'm glad we're getting to know each other.
So ......?
Hmmm... ...... hmmm?　<cf>A pseudo-avaritia is the queen's daughter?
Moreover, the other party is human, and <cf>Kava Aku-sama has known about it from the very beginning......!
Wait a minute. There's too much information to ......<cf>sort it out once and for all!
Hmmm, that's this and ......<cf>this is that and ......<cf>this is that and ......Okay, OK!
So, in the end, where is [Mitsuka]i?
......The dragon tribe took it away from me!
Then, you are dealing with a dragon tribe ...... dragon king, right? <cf>It's going to be quite a dangerous journey......
I'll be here, cheering you on as best I can! <cf>Please make sure you come back safely!　That's a promise!
...... What am I doing?
I'll tell you, <cf>but please don't say anything else!
I buried a treasure chest here. <cf>It's a record of the many punishments I received from the Order!
Starting with my leftward transfer to Minsterhorn, <cf>this and that,</cf> ......
Not just personal things, <cf>black rumors that can't be made public: ......
I've also added some rumors I've heard recently.
And also information about places that are hard to reach by the cult. <cf>In case someone takes over my will!
I hope that people in the future who see this will face <cf> the cult correctly!　Hahahahaha!
I am a class master. <cf>The one who masters and presides over all classes.
Hou ....... <cf>You have strange eyes.
I see. No wonder everyone is talking about you.
Good. Well, then, <cf>I shall have a small part in your future.
<cf>I am an adventurer with the fire of destiny in my eyes. <cf>I would like to offer you some advice on "class.
<cf>You know well that adventurers fight in many different ways.
You yourself may have chosen a class, and you may be studying it day by day in order to master the art.
However, it is not easy to master the art.
As long as you remain attached to one class, <cf>you will never be able to understand that class.
Experiencing and comparing other classes is <cf>the first step to discovering the true nature of a class.
From now on, I will talk about <cf>"class change".
The essence of the royal road to the ultimate in class. <cf>I'm sure it will help you.
First, let's talk about weapons. <cf>Ownership of weapons is essential for class change.
Do you know where the weapons shop is? <cf> It is located on the first floor of the shopping mall.
I'll head there first. <cf>We'll talk again there.
You're here. <cf>So, let me tell you about class changes and weapons.
When you change classes, <cf>prepare weapons of the class you are changing to in advance.
If you don't have a weapon to use, you won't be able to fight.
Don't forget to prepare the weapons you can equip. <cf>It is also a good idea to get weapons for all classes
You can buy weapons from these stores, or you can craft them yourself.
In any case, you don't want to find yourself <cf>without weapons when you change classes!
I thought of something else, but it would be <cf>somewhat annoying</cf> to talk in a storefront.
Let's change the place. The second floor of the pioneer station is good. <cf>I'll be waiting by the stairs. See you then....
Thank you for your help. <cf>Now let's talk about the details of the class change.
You can change your class by yourself. <cf>You may attempt it whenever you wish.
However, each class level is different. <cf>Be aware of the basics!
Be especially careful with classes that are new to you or of a lower level than <cf>you are currently at!
Because their combat ability returns according to their level,<cf> going into battle without realizing it can lead to unexpected accidents.
There is a strong possibility that you may have switched to a weapon you are familiar with. <cf>If you feel the same as usual, you may be confused.
You must calmly judge the situation you are in.
The significance of experiencing more than one class is great. <cf>It will bring you many things.
Forward or backward? <cf>The way you see the battlefield and the way you act will be completely different even with that much change.
By all means, get to know the various classes by changing your class!
That's all the advice I have for you. <cf>Don't forget to remind yourself of this from time to time.
I wish you the best of luck. <cf> May there be light on your path to martial arts.
Normally, I am here to explore the path of the martial arts.
I may have the opportunity to give you advice again. <cf>I hope you will visit me then
May light shine upon the path you conquer. <cf>[sighs]First, keep going!
Hey, sss~. <cf>Welcome to Craftsman Square!
I would say ......, but seriously! <cf>I've suddenly got a lot of work to do.
<cf>I'd be happy if you could come back on a new day? <cf>Please forgive me today.
<cf> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. <cf>So you're interested in weapon crafting if you're asking me out?
Ok, ok, ok. Leave it to me! <cf>I'll take care of it and it'll be perfect!
What's that?　Adventurer, don't we know each other from somewhere? <cf>It's not that I don't recognize you, it's just that you look familiar~......
Ah!　Could it be that <cf>Jake has unearthed a super-duper promising new star?　Oh, man, I'm so excited~upupupupup
I'm Huovi from Imagine Institute. I'll be in touch soon! <cf>I'm your man when it comes to weapon crafting!
It's a joint venture between the Pioneer Bureau and our Imagine Institute. <cf>We want adventurers to try their hand at crafting!
<cf>Well, it wouldn't hurt for adventurers to know about weapon crafting, would it?
There are three steps to crafting a weapon.
1. find a recipe for a weapon<cf>2. gather the materials described in the recipe
3. Craft the weapon using the "Rolling Ball Crafting Ritual"<cf>This will give you a new weapon, so keep it in mind!
You've already been to the Lake Tunnel, right? <cf>If you cleared that tunnel, you should have picked up the recipe.
<cf>You can check all the recipes you have and the materials you need at the "Transfer Ball Crafting Ceremony" there.
The weapons I want you to make are from the "Adventures" series. <cf>Any kind of weapon will do.
Just show me the weapon you crafted and you're done! <cf>I'll be waiting for you here, so good luck!
<cf>It's also useful for adventurers to experience weapon crafting!
I'm thinking "Adventure" series weapons. <cf>Craft them and show them to me.
It won't take long if you're good at it, right? <cf>Clean it up quickly and get a reward!　That's hilarious~!
Good night. <cf>Oh!　You've made a great weapon!
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit!　You're swallowing fast, aren't you? <cf>This is good!　Seriously, I'm so excited~upupupup!
Adventurer, you are overflowing with crafting talent! <cf>Glare, glare, glare!
<cf>Not all crafted weapons have the same performance.
Some have special effects against goblins, some have more sockets for attaching abilities, and some have various other features.
It's just a fun thing to do when crafting! <cf>The trick is to try it more than once!
<cf>When you find a recipe for a weapon, you can craft your new weapon right away!
Also, have you heard of "Enhance Imagine"?
You can get it by crafting it, too. <cf>It's useful for adventurers too!
<cf>There's a guy named Poirier at the Imagine Lab, so you might want to ask him about it.
The Imagine Institute is just to the left of the Pioneer Station.
<cf>Come to me again if you need anything else. <cf>We're friends now, aren't we?　We're all mates now, right?
Good luck with your crafts and adventures! <cf>So!　I'm going to put some energy into it too!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! <cf>Wow, your gear looks great today!
<cf>We've been crafting weapons and Imagines, and we're getting into the swing of things!
Find your favorite weapon or Imagine. <cf>See the difference between us and others?　Let's show them!
Oh, welcome. <cf>Are you interested in Imagine?
This is the Imagine Lab. <cf>Anything about Imagine, you can talk to us!
<cf>I'm a little busy right now. <cf>When things calm down, we'll take care of it.
Welcome to the Imagine Institute. <cf>Are you the adventurer Jake said you found?
My name is Poirier. I'm an apprentice at the Imagine Institute. <cf> Nice to meet you.
<cf>The Pioneer Bureau and the Imagine Institute have a joint project for adventurers to try their hand at crafts.
The craft you'll get to try here is the <cf>Enhanced Imagine Craft.
I've been asked by MURI to explain it to you, and <cf>I'll do a great job of it!
Enhance Imagine is an "equipable Imagine". <cf>It enhances the abilities of the wearer.
It is an Imagine that not only increases your offensive ability, but also your defensive ability, mental strength, and psychokinesis<cf>.
Crafting an Enhance Imagine is the same as crafting a weapon. <cf>First, you need a recipe.
The recipe for the trial session is "E-Uri Uribo". <cf>If you've already registered as an adventurer, you should already have it.
Enhance Imagine is crafted using a seed as the nucleus and <cf>catalyst materials.
In this case, it's "Piece of Dynamic Engram" and "Tokoyo Grass". <cf>You should be able to find them by looking for them in the "Sea Rhythm Meadow.
Crafting of Imagine will be accepted at the lab. <cf>Speak to the staff at the counter downstairs.
Finally, <cf>show me your finished enhanced Imagine and you're good to go!
I'm sure it won't take you long, adventurer. <cf>Good luck then!
I want you to experience <cf>crafting the "E-Uri Uribo" of the Enhance Imagine!
You can find the necessary "Piece of Dynamic Engram" and "Tokoyo Grass"<cf> by looking for "Sea Rhyme Meadow"!
After that, ask the staff at the counter downstairs and they will <cf>craft the Imagine for you.
<cf>When you're done, come and see me. <cf>Good luck then!
Good work. <cf>Did you finish crafting the Enhanced Imagine?
Yeah, that's good. <cf>No problem.
Did you get the crafting process figured out? <cf>I know I'll be doing this a lot, so keep that in mind.
There are all kinds of Enhance Imagine, too. <cf>Search for recipes in your adventures and use them as you go!
And then there's Battle Imagine, too, at the Institute: ......
Hey, Sssou. How's it going, how's it going, how's it going?
Huovi!　Hey, what are you doing here?
I was just wondering if you were doing your job properly. <cf> I was wondering if you're screwing up and causing trouble.　I mean...
I don't need you to tell me that! <cf>Give it a rest. Don't bother me.
Oh!　You've got your Enhance Imagine! <cf>Adventurer, did you hear about Battle Imagine?
<cf>You can craft Battle Imagine in the lab. <cf>The method is the same as for Enhanced Imagine.
Find the recipe, gather the materials, <cf>ask at the counter, and you're good to go.
If you want to make weapons, you can go to the rolling ball workshop. For Imagine, go to the laboratory. <cf>Remember this, yo, shi, ku*.
<span size="Big">Don't take someone's job! </>
Why are you taking over?　<span size="Big">Don't take someone's job! <cf>I wrote down everything you said until the end!
<cf>Because you've been taking it easy! <cf>That's why you'll always be an apprentice!
<cf>Are you telling me that your answers were off on the exam the other day too? <cf>Calm down a bit. Just like me☆ who passed the exam the first time.
You!　How dare you say things you shouldn't say just because you're a regular employee!
You're just a little brother!　You're just a little brother! <cf>Why are you always like that, damn you!
Ha, ha. ...... I just got so excited. <cf>I'm so sorry you had to see that.
...... I need to study for my exams. <cf>I can't let Huo Vi say whatever she wants any more!
You're just a little brother. ...... you're just a little brother! <cf>Why is he the only regular employee?　I'm so disappointed!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Do you know about the "Pieces of Ancient Mural"?
If you find any, I'd like you to collect as many as you can. <cf>And give them to us later?
We will be very grateful. <cf>In exchange for a great prize!
<cf>Ancient murals shattered into pieces is very exciting. <cf>That's what romance is all about, haha!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurer. <cf>We're glad you called out to us!
Welcome, adventurer. <cf>Are you here to indulge our master's hobby?
Oh, you don't know about this great opportunity, do you? <cf>Excuse me!　First of all, let me introduce myself!
I am Carnera, messenger of the <cf>"King Collector," a wealthy man and a great collector!
I am Varen, messenger of <cf>The King Collector</cf>!
Our master, the King Collector, is a man with an insatiable appetite for collecting!
Whenever he finds something of interest, he collects it <cf>without a care in the world</cf>!
If adventurers bring in their own items, we will exchange them for <cf>gorgeous prizes</cf>!
These luxury prizes are <cf>rare, famous, and valuable items brought out of the "King Collector's" warehouse!
This is a <cf>great chance for adventurers to obtain valuable items!
This time, my master has his eyes on <cf>"Piece of Ancient Mural"!
<cf>It is a piece of a mural painting that was found in an ancient city. <cf>They were crumbled away in an old war.
My husband is trying to collect all the pieces and <cf>restore</cf> the mural!
It is difficult to understand the thoughts of a drunken man of leisure. <cf>Anyhow, the master's desire to collect is unrelenting!
<cf>Collect as many "Pieces of Ancient Murals" as you can and deliver them to us!
Oh, by the way, Varen. <cf> Did you find the "Piece of Ancient Mural"?
Hahaha!　Of course I did. <cf>The one where the rumblebore nibbles on it and takes it with him!
If you defeat it, I think you can get <cf>much more</cf> than you would normally get!
I can't really do anything about it, so <cf>I'll at least be honest about what I saw!　Hahaha!
Yes, that's right. Adventurer. <cf>Since my partner seems to have missed his chance
Could you please defeat the rumblebores in the "Minster Hills" and <cf>get the "Piece of Ancient Mural"?
Of course, all the pieces you find can be <cf> made into your achievements.
I look forward to working with you, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>As expected, my master is going to be very angry with me. Please help me!
Even if my master misses it, though, I won't allow it. <cf>Then, Mr. Adventurer. I look forward to working with you!
I want you to go to the "Minster Hills" and take down the Rumblebores. <cf>You should be able to get a lot of "Pieces of Ancient Mural"!
The "Pieces of Ancient Mural" that you collect will be exchanged for a great prize! <cf>Thanks for your help, haha!
Oh!　Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>You got the "Piece of Ancient Mural", didn't you?
You are a brilliant hand! <cf>I am also impressed!
Keep up the good work and collect more and more, <cf>and exchange them for gorgeous prizes!　Hahaha!
<cf>The "Pieces of Ancient Mural" seem to be scattered all over the world!
The original murals are quite large, and <cf>the "Pieces of Ancient Mural" must be enormous!
Some monsters were attracted by the engrams and took them away. <cf>We may be able to find them by defeating them.
Sometimes, as in this case, we make requests.
If you accept, <cf>you should be able to get a lot of "Pieces of Ancient Mural"!
Let's collect the "Pieces of Ancient Mural" and <cf>all</cf> be happy!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you collected the "Pieces of Ancient Mural"?
I hear they are scattered all over the world, so <cf>please keep collecting them!
Give them to Carnera and she'll exchange them for some great prizes! <cf>Let's get excited!　Hahaha!
HU...... lost ancient murals, huh? <cf>It must be beautiful and fascinating!
But, alas, <cf>they are not!　<cf>Alas, there is nothing more beautiful than me in this world!
Oh, adventurer, how can I help you? <cf> Did you get a request to talk to a pervert?
Ah, it's "Piece of Ancient Mural", isn't it? <cf>Thanks to your help, we are collecting them smoothly.
<cf>My husband is working hard on the restoration. <cf>But it is still far from completion.
<cf>Poor mural. <cf>It has yet to regain the beauty of yesteryear. ......
<cf>Even if it were to be restored, <cf>as long as I am here, it will never reach the pinnacle of beauty!
Beauty is a sin. Sinful me! <cf>Oh, if only I were not here!
What a coincidence, isn't it? <cf>I also think many times, ["]If only you weren't here ["]"]!
Or, like the "Piece of Ancient Mural," <cf> I still wish it would shatter.
Speaking of "Pieces of an Ancient Mural," I forgot!
I found a chunk of it in the Andorra Basin, <cf>with a swarm of tyrant boas around it.
My beauty-crazed body couldn't get close enough to it!
So, adventurer! <cf>Could you help me defeat the Tyrant Boars?
Considering the Tyrant Boa's habit, it may be swallowing <cf>"Piece of Ancient Mural" </cf>.
This is a chance to get <cf>a lot of ancient mural pieces</cf> at once!
We don't want the other pieces to be swallowed! <cf>Please take down the Tyrant Boar while you can, adventurers!
I'm counting on you to take down the Tyrant Boa! <cf>The location is the Andorra Basin!
<cf>It's swallowing chunks of "Piece of Ancient Mural", so it's a chance to get a lot of them at once, haha!
<cf>You defeated the Tyrant Boa! <cf> Hahaha!　Isn't that great?
As usual, you are doing a wonderful job!
If we can obtain this many "pieces of ancient mural painting", <cf>the restoration will make great progress!
By the way, Carnera. <cf>How many pieces do I need to collect?
Since there is the original mural, <cf>there are not an infinite number, right?
Certainly not infinite. <cf>But the end is endlessly far away!
It is a huge mural to begin with. <cf>Numerous pieces are repeatedly pasted one by one on the wall
<cf>Only our master, who has too much time and desire, would be able to do this work.
<cf>The four corners of the jigsaw puzzle. <cf>The pieces that fit into the corners of the jigsaw puzzle.
<cf>More than ten of these pieces have already been found!
Hahaha! <cf>This is a complicated shaped mural with several corners, isn't it?
<cf>That's a brilliantly twee imagination! <cf>That means there are multiple murals!
Perhaps these murals were painted on the ceilings and walls of cathedrals and other <cf>massive buildings!
It may take <cf>decades</cf> to finish restoring all of them!
That's a grand story! <cf>Our name will go down in history!
<cf>The day when we go down in history as the most unplanned of the rare may come if we're wrong!
Don't mind us, adventurers! <cf>Please collect "Pieces of Ancient Murals"!
<cf>Adventurers, don't worry! <cf>Please satisfy your master's desire to collect~!
Hahaha! <cf>Have you collected the "Pieces of Ancient Mural"?
<cf>My husband's cheeks have been puckered up lately! <cf> I guess the restoration work on the mural must be tough!
<cf>He won't back down until it's done! <cf>Adventurers, please keep delivering the pieces!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Welcome aboard!
This is a good place, adventurer. <cf>I would like to ask for your assistance!
<cf>A powerful rival has arrived to collect the "Piece of Ancient Mural"! <cf>The goblins are restoring the mural!
<cf>Adventurers have seen strange murals on the outskirts of the Foothills of the Pacified Mountains.
It is the lair of goblins. <cf>The mural, which was in the process of being restored, had been placed there.
It was part of the very mural we were collecting pieces of and <cf>restoring!
What a surprise! <cf>The beauty of the mural attracted even the goblins!
After all, beauty is a sin! <cf>The goblins who were dazzled by it were also guilty!
What nonsense, pervert! <cf>You may think so, but you are not wrong!
<cf>It seems that the goblins are attacking people in order to obtain the "Piece of Ancient Mural"!
It is futile to ask those people to look the other way. <The damage is only going to increase.
We can't just ignore them. <cf>And we can't give them the "Piece of Ancient Mural" either.
<cf>Would you please take down the Goblin Warrior at the foot of the Mountains of Calm, Mr. Adventurer?
It is believed to be the ringleader of the goblins. <cf> Once this is defeated, the rest will be crowds.
<cf>The men who are under the authority of the Goblin Warrior will leave the mural and the pieces behind.
The remaining "Piece of the Ancient Mural" can be taken by <cf>the adventurers!
We will, of course, exchange it for a great prize! <cf>Please help us~!
Go to "The Foot of the Pacifying Mountains" and take down the <cf>Goblin Warrior</cf>!
We mustn't let the goblins get any more of the <cf>Pieces of Ancient Mural</cf>!
For the sake of the "King Collector's" dreams and honor, <cf>please do me a favor!　Hahaha!
You defeated the Goblin Warrior, didn't you? <cf> That's what I'd expect from an adventurer!　Thank you!
I can't thank you enough, Adventurer! <cf>Thank you very much!
Now the goblins will not be able to touch the mural. <cf>The collection of "Piece of Ancient Mural" will be safe!
<cf>My master, the King Collector, has asked me to thank you for your kindness.
Well, well, well. <cf>It seems that there are still more "Pieces of Ancient Mural" to be collected!
As we have said before, <cf>there is more than one mural!
The one that the goblins almost restored <cf>also had a different design!
Hahaha! <cf>That makes it worthwhile, doesn't it?
Please continue to <cf>collect the "Piece of Ancient Mural"!
Both the pieces and the master's desire to collect them are truly ceilingless! <cf>You can exchange them for gorgeous prizes as much as you like!
<cf>Come on, bring it on! <cf>We're looking forward to your adventures!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>There are still more "Pieces of Ancient Mural" to be collected!
Keep collecting them, and exchange them for gorgeous prizes!
Let's all get excited! <cf>Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you heard of "Fake Sweets"?
That's a well-made sweet, by the way. <cf>I can't help but eat it, haha!
<cf>"Fake Sweets" is what my husband has his eyes on this time.
They are toys made to look just like real sweets, and <cf>they are a legacy of Buffalia!
<cf>They smell and feel just like sweets. <cf>They are the kind of thing that tickle the fancy of collectors.
My husband, the "King Collector," had his desire to collect these toys shot through with a thud!
Fake sweets" were used in old festivals.
Everyone would dress up in costumes and pass out candy to each other. <cf> Sounds like a fun festival, right?
Originally, it was a custom to leave some of the harvested crops in the woods to <cf>keep the monsters from coming to the fields.
Somewhere along the way, it turned into a festival for giving out <cf>sweets</cf>.
In recent years, more and more people have started to imitate the festival in Asterlys.
First of all, let's have adventurers pick up some <cf>"fake sweets"!
Could you go to the "Minster Hills" and take down Uribo?
I found some "fake sweets" in that area, but <cf>We were having trouble with the Uribos coming close to us.
If you defeat them, we will give you <cf>fake sweets</cf>!
This is a chance to get more than you would normally look for! <cf>Please don't miss it!
<cf>Defeat Uribo in the "Minster Hills". <cf>In return, I'll give you some "fake sweets"!
We'll give away a lot of them, so it's a bargain! <cf>Aim to exchange them for great prizes!　Hahaha!
Oh, adventurer! <cf>You got rid of Uribo, didn't you?
That was a brilliant move! <cf>My thanks to you as well!
I'll give you "Fake Sweets" as promised! <cf>How do you like it?　It smells as sweet as the real thing, doesn't it?
<cf>This scent attracts monsters. <cf>Some of them take it as it is.
<cf>But it would be boring to just collect them. <cf>This festival also includes a "costume" set!
<cf>We will give away these "Gao Gao gloves, wisteria purple-limit" as a rental!
Please try them on and enjoy the masquerade!
Hahaha!　Of course, adventurers are welcome to show off their <cf>proud costumes!
You can match it with the "Gao Gao Gloves"! <cf>You can also show off your originality and individuality!
<cf>Your "fake sweets" will be exchanged for <cf>gorgeous prizes!
Please note that "Gao Gao handbags, wisteria purple - limited" will be collected <cf>afterwards!
During this time of year, you may see people dressed up in costumes in various places.
The reason why you may see a little eerie design is because it is a remnant of the time when <cf>we gave crops to monsters.
It is said that it is an <cf>expression that you are a monster receiving sweets!
Hahaha! <cf>It's best to enjoy yourself in your own costume!
<cf>Collecting "Fake Sweets" and exchanging them for gorgeous prizes! <cf>Please enjoy yourself~!
Hahaha!　What do you think? <cf>Have you collected your "fake sweets"?
Various monsters seem to be attracted by the smell. <cf>I think we can get them if we defeat them.
Collect as many as you can and trade them in for prizes! <cf>I hope you get your favorite outfit!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>How's your "Fake Sweets" collecting going?
Ouch!　Ouch! <cf>My tooth, my tooth hurts so much!
<cf>My apologies, adventurer. <cf>My partner is currently suffering from a cavity.
<cf>I was lured by the sweet aroma of "fake sweets," <cf>and I just wanted to eat the real thing!
The result of overindulging is a cavity.
That's right!　Speaking of overeating! <cf> There's a monster out there that eats "fake sweets"!
Rumblebores! <cf>A nifty little thing that eats everything and gets fat!
<cf>It seems that the sweet smell of "fake sweets" has lured him in, and he's putting them in his mouth at random.
That's not a good thing, is it? <cf>We can't have them snatching "Fake Sweets" from us!
So there you go, adventurer! <cf>Could you please take down the rumblebores?
The "fake sweets" they have swallowed <cf>will be given to the adventurers as they are!
I'd like to ask you to do the same, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>It would hinder our efforts to collect "fake sweets".
Please get your hands on some "fake sweets" <cf>while you are defeating the enemy!
Defeat the Rumble Boars in the Andorra Basin and get <cf>a lot of Fake Sweets</cf>!
Defeat the <cf>Rumblebores</cf> that appear in the Andorra Basin!
They seem to eat the "Fake Sweets". <cf>Get them back together!　Hahaha!
You took down the rumblebores! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
We are fortunate that the one with the "Fake Sweets" was <cf>before the damage was done!
This sweet scent. It seems it was originally put on to lure out monsters.
What do you mean by that, Carnera? <cf> That would be dangerous.
Originally, it was a custom to place harvested crops in the forest to keep monsters away from the fields.
<cf>"Fake sweets" were made in place of the crops.
The sweet aroma of the forest would surely keep away the monsters.
Other times, it was used to lure them in and trap them.
Oh, by the way, some fools were lured by the scent and ate sweets until they got cavities.
Ouch! <cf>My forgotten tooth decay hurts!
Don't worry, adventurers, we'll take care of you. <cf>We still have a great selection of prizes!
<cf>Please continue to collect your "fake sweets" <cf>cumbrously!
Hahaha!　Adventurers. <cf>Have you been brushing your teeth?
Don't get so caught up in collecting "fake sweets" that you disrupt <cf>your life</cf>!
<cf>The prizes won't run away from you! <cf>Take your time to collect your "fake sweets"!
Hahaha!　Adventurer. <cf>Will you wait a minute? These kids are ......
Hey, hey!　Give me some snacks!　I want some candy!
It smells so sweet! <cf> Give me candy or I'll play a prank on you!
I don't want anyone to play tricks on this very special costume! <cf>Okay!　Then I'll give you this!
Yay, candy!　Thank you!
Oh dear. <cf>At a festival where sweets are given, <cf>the children are still the stars!
Vallen. Didn't you give the kids <cf>"fake sweets" earlier?
Huh?　<span size="Big">...... ah! </>
Sheesh!　You guys!　You guys!
I don't know which one of us was the prankster. <cf> And I thought that thing was the last thing you had on hand.
That's right!　Adventurer! <cf>We're in trouble!
Actually, the peddlers were supposed to deliver <cf>fake sweets</cf> to us.
<cf>They were attacked by Horngoths at the foot of the Mount of Calm, and <cf>they took it away from them!
At this rate, I'll have to report to my <cf>master</cf> that we've achieved nothing today!
I am sure you will be scolded, Varen. <cf> You will be punished, Varen.
Oh, yes!　I don't want to have to transcribe the "King Collector's" catalog from <cf> scratch anymore!
Mr. Adventurer!　<cf>Please lend me your help to prevent that from happening!
Defeat the Horned Goat at the foot of the Mountains of Calm, and <cf>retrieve the Fake Suites</cf>!
We will record the stolen "Fake Suites" as <cf>Adventurer's Achievement</cf>!
This cannot be passed off as a prank. <cf>Please help us, please!
<cf>The "King Collector's" punishment is on my spirit! <cf>I'd be happy to help me, haha!
Oh, adventurer! <cf> You've taken down the Horngoat!
Hey, sorry about that. <cf>I'm surrounded by kids again. ......
Hey, hey, give me some candy! <cf>The candy you gave me before, it was a toy!
Give me real candy or <cf>I'm going to prank you this time!
Yes, yes, good girls. <cf> Please let him have this candy!
Yay, real candy! <cf>Thank you, sister!
I'll return the toys you gave me before. <cf> Also, we picked up some toy candy too.
I'll give it to your sister as a thank you. Here you go!
Phew, good grief. <cf>I guess we've got our "fake sweets" back, and that settles the matter.
I'm proud of my outfit and I didn't get pranked! <cf>Thanks for saving me, Carnera!
What are you saying, sir? <cf>I'm just a child lover by nature!
<cf>Don't forget, we'll get the money for the sweets later!
Hahaha!　You're right, Carnera is very strict! <cf>Thank you again, adventurer!
I'm still waiting for my "fake sweets"! <cf>Gather them up and bring them to me!
Please continue to exchange many "fake sweets" for <cf>gorgeous prizes~!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Do you have any "fake sweets"?
I made sure to carry <cf>real sweets</cf> for the kids!
It's a festival of sweet smells and mischief! <cf>Enjoy the festivities, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hmph...... overflowing. It's overflowing! <cf>Men and women in swimsuits all over Asterlys!
This is summer!　A [body festival] in the sun! <cf>My body is also screaming with fury, hahaha!
Hahaha! <cf> You've got a good eye to call out to me!
Fine, I'll give you all of me ...... what, no?
Oh, is this about "The Shell of Sanwe"?
If so, you'd better give me a call, not that pervert over there...
...... your face, if you don't know about the event that makes summer in Asterlys <cf> even hotter!
Excuse me. Let me introduce myself again!
We are seeking the <cf>"Shells of Sanve" as ordered by our master!
If you bring them to us, we will exchange them for a splendid prize~!
<cf>Samwe shells are shells that are harvested this time of year. <cf>It is often used as a material for ornaments. ......
My husband wants these shells very badly!
You can get "Sanwe shells" by wearing a bathing suit and killing <cf>monsters</cf>!
But Carnera. Some adventurers don't <cf>have</cf> swimsuits, do they?
Don't worry!　This is the event period. <cf>For everyone's enjoyment!
If you complete a simple request, we will <cf>rent you one swimsuit for free~!
Isn't that a good deal? <cf>So, what are you asking the adventurers to do?
<cf>I want you to kill one of the shell goblins in the Minster Hills.
They are also after "Sanwe's Shells," so to speak, and they are our business rivals! <cf>We want to reduce the number of rivals!
It's a goblin with a tropical, summery appearance. <cf>They're goblins with a tropical, "summer!
<cf>When you defeat them, report back to me! <cf>Thank you for your help!　Hahaha!
Go to the Minster Hills and kill one of the <cf>Shell Goblins</cf>!
Your new swimsuit is just around the corner! <cf>Show everyone what you look like in your swimsuit!　Hahaha!
Oh, adventurer! <cf>You took down the shell goblin!
Splendid handiwork. ......　I am very impressed as well!
Now, as promised, I'm renting you a free swimsuit!
You can wear this swimsuit, or you can get one of your own.
Anyway, if you wear the swimsuit and defeat the monsters, you will get <cf>"Sanwe's Shell"!
Rental swimsuits will be returned after the event period. <cf>Please be careful!
If you collect "Sanwe's Shells" and exchange them, <cf>you will get a good swimsuit that you can use forever!
Are you embarrassed to go on an adventure in a swimsuit? <cf>No problem if you wear it with everyone!
King Collector, the master, is the very embodiment of greed.
He is the incarnation of greed and self-control in the face of what he wants! <cf>He is a very bad person for children's education!
And this summer, my husband's desire to collect has turned to <cf>Samwe's Shells</cf>!
The prizes to be exchanged <cf>all prepared by the King Collector</cf>!
<cf>We have a wide variety of rare and famous items! <cf>Adventurers are welcome to join us!
<cf>Please put on your swimsuit, get your hands on a "Sanwe shell," and satisfy your <cf>master's bottomless desire to collect!
Hahaha!　I'm looking good in my swimsuit, aren't I?
Hmph, summer is great ......, the splashing sweat and dripping seawater adding luster to my <cf>statuesque</cf> body!
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Why are you talking to that pervert again?
Was it in your parents' will that you should throw away your time?
But, but...but...but...but...but...but...but..! <cf> Listen, Carnera, adventurer!
I'm so beautiful, <cf> yet somehow I can't get people to look at me!
This is not right, no matter what you think!
Everything is out of order, but let's hear the rest of the story!
I've come to a realization! <cf>It's the shell goblins that are the source of all this!
Their glamour definitely catches people's attention!
My perfect body!　<cf>They're taking all the eyes away from <cf>my perfect body!
Oh my!　That's a shocking story, isn't it? <cf>Your misguidedness makes me look up to the heavens!
Mr. Adventurer, we have neither the time nor the need to <cf>listen</cf> to such an ampontine story. But, but ......
I would like to <cf>request</cf> you to take down the shell goblins!
Their numbers increase at this time of year, and <cf>they seem to be collecting "Sanwe's Shells" too!
The shell goblins have become <cf>an obstacle</cf> to collecting "Sanwe shells!
But this is also an opportunity!
The Shell Goblins have "Sanwe's Shells". <cf>If you defeat them, you will get a large amount of shells!
<cf>Adventurers will get great prizes, and <cf>I</cf> will have the summer's gaze all to myself!
Now, head to the "Andorra Basin" and defeat five <cf>Seashell Goblins</cf>!
Don't forget to wear your swimsuit to collect the <cf>Sanve Shells</cf>!
Go to the Andorra Basin and kill five <cf>Seashell Goblins</cf>!
To get back the <cf>Sunve Shells</cf> and the summer gaze that is directed at me!　I'm counting on you!
Hahaha!　Let us be grateful, adventurer! <cf>Now all those hot eyes will be on me!
I'd better put on some sunscreen or I'll get burned.
I don't mind if you just let me turn into a charcoal extinguisher. <cf>Adventurer, I thank you, too~!
But still, Carnera. <cf>Who exactly are shell goblins?
They look different from other goblins, both in appearance and strength.
The shell goblin seems to be an individual who plays a <cf>prayer-like</cf> role in the goblin herd.
The reason they appear at this time of year is because <cf>the goblins must have their own summer festivals.
Does this mean that the goblins are high on festivals? <cf>Summer makes all things open, you know!
And the shell goblins use <cf>"Sanwe shells" as ornaments for their festivities!
Does that mean they're a tasty opponent?
That's right!　<cf>They are the perfect target for collecting "Sanwe shells"!
I see!　Adventurers, if you find any shell goblins, <cf>positively try to take them down!
Furthermore!　If you <cf>advance</cf> through the adventure board we're giving you this time, you'll get a special Battle Imagine recipe!
If you miss out now, you never know when you'll get it next!
What a surprise!　This is a great chance for even the strongest adventurers to <cf>single up</cf> the summer's attention!
Please try your hand at the <cf>Adventure Board</cf> as well as collecting the <cf>San Ve Shells</cf>!
Come on, come on, summer is still going on!
Please satisfy our master's desire to collect <cf> with your further adventures!
Hey there, adventurer!　Hey, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>How are you getting on with collecting "Sanwe shells"?
Summer is just around the corner!
Get your hands on some great prizes and enjoy this summer to the fullest!
Why, oh why?　The summer's eyes are on me, <cf>They're not looking hard enough!
My perfect body and swimsuit! <cf>Where is the flaw ......?
<cf>I'm not sure where, but it's all so weird. <cf>I'm troubled by my partner's stupidity!
I'm in trouble...... I see!　We are all in trouble!
They must not be enjoying <cf>the summer</cf> because they are troubled by the threat of the shell goblin!　That's a serious thing!
You have a very fertile imagination, don't you? <cf>I won't read it, but why don't you become a novelist?
The Summer Jammer, the Shell Goblin! <cf>Mr. Adventurer, we have no other choice but to defeat them all!
<cf>Will you please go to the foot of the Mountains of Calm and kill 20 shell goblins?
After that many goblins, no one will care about the shell goblins!
The eyes of summer will be glued to the adventurers and <cf>my perfect body!
What do you think?　How do you like it, Mr. Adventurer? <cf> Defeat 20 shell goblins!
If you successfully accomplish this, I will give you the <cf>Samwe's Shells</cf> that Varen collected on his own!
Hahaha!　Why are you talking like that?
No, but!　It's for everyone's summer! <cf> Fine!　I'll be a man and pay the price!
Again, don't forget to wear your <cf>swimsuit</cf> when collecting "Sanwe's Shells"!
Good luck! <cf>This is a great chance to win some great prizes!
Adventurers!　<cf>Defeat 20 Seashell Goblins at the foot of the Mountains of Calm!
It's for everyone's summer! <cf>I'll reward you with my collection of Sanwe's Shells!
Don't forget to wear your swimsuit! <cf>I won't be able to get my "Sanwe's Shells"!
Ooooooh!　You have <cf> accomplished</cf> the defeat of 20 shell goblins!
This is unprecedented and unprecedented skill~!
Nothing but praise for the adventurer spills from my mouth as well! <cf>Well, that's a wonderful job, sir!
Now the summer's eyes are glued to you and me! <cf>Well, let's enjoy the rest of the summer!
Oh, is that you guys? <cf> for defeating the shell goblin.
<cf>Well, thanks a lot. <cf>We were having our fields ravaged, too, so thanks for your help!
Here you go. Summer vegetables. <cf>Please eat it with everyone.
Well, well, well. <cf>We received an unexpected summer gift!
Wonderful! <cf>It will be a good souvenir for the king collector!
<cf>It's worth it for me to splash <cf>Samwe's Shells</cf>!
<cf>When 20 shell goblins are defeated, it will be the talk of the goblins!
If the presence of shell goblins in the herd becomes a danger, <cf>they will soon disappear!
Hahaha!　The summer of the shell goblins is over! <cf>From here on out, no one will be able to interfere with our summer!
You, too, can be the center of the summer's attention with your cool swimsuits!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you collected your Sanwe shells?
Summer won't wait for you! <cf>Don't miss out on all the glances and the great prizes!
<cf>Gather up your "Sanwe shells" for the best summer ever!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers! Do you know <cf> "[cotton wool crystal]"?
Hmmm, the fluffy texture is irresistible. <cf>I'd love to have a good night's sleep on a futon like this!　Hahaha!
Welcome, adventurer. <cf>Are you willing to indulge our master's taste?
<cf>My husband has his eye on this one, "cotton wool crystal.
At first glance, it looks fluffy like a rabbit's tail. <cf>In fact, it is an engram crystallized in the shape of cotton.
<cf>It is a rare fluff that is produced when the climate meets certain conditions!
Hahaha!　Go gather them up as soon as possible, will you? <cf>...... and I'd like to say...
<cf>The goblins in "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" seem to be after these "cotton wool crystals".
After all, it has an overwhelmingly fluffy feeling. <cf>Does it make the monsters crazy about it?
However, it is true that it is an obstacle to collecting. <cf>It would be a disaster if anyone was harmed!
Mr. Adventurer. First of all, can't we ask you to secure our<cf>safety by defeating the goblins?
After killing five of them, they should become a little more docile! <cf>After that, we can start collecting "cotton wool crystals!　Hahaha!
Can you please take down five goblins in <cf>"Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon: A Free Search"?
We need to ensure the safety of the "Woolly Crystals" collection! <cf>I'm looking forward to your efforts, adventurer!
<cf>When you're done, please report back to me! <cf>Thank you for your help, hahaha!
Oh, I see you've already defeated the goblins!　You've killed goblins already?
I can't believe you accomplished it so easily! <cf>You are indeed very good at this!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf> Now you can collect the [cotton wool crystals]!
But, Carnera. What does the "King Collector" intend to use the "cotton wool crystals" for?
My husband's goal is to make an oversized cushion filled with "wadding crystals.
I've heard that! <cf>It's that thing where the person who sleeps on it gets ruined!
I wonder what will happen to my already ruined husband. <cf>This is what I do every time I have too much time, effort, and greed!
Hahaha!　But it's still not enough to <cf>stuff</cf> into a fluffy cushion!
We need more and more "[cotton wool crystals]"!
Come on, you don't want to miss this opportunity!
Please collect "cotton wool crystals" and win a lot of <cf>precious prizes!
Hello, adventurers! <cf>How's your "cotton wool crystals" collecting going?
It seems that <cf>"cotton wool crystals" are often found attached to the body surface of monsters!
You should be able to get some <cf>"wadding crystals" </cf> by defeating monsters!
<cf>When you've collected them, bring them to us! <cf>We'll be waiting in anticipation, hahaha!
<cf> My beauty is like a flower covered in cotton wool. <cf> You've been sucked in like a bee, adventurer!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>You may be collecting "cotton wool crystals," but you don't have to go along with such fluffy behavior.
My partner's head is as flowery as ever. <cf>Should I spray herbicide through her nose?
Hahaha!　Speaking of which, <cf>I've come up with a great idea about "[cotton wool crystal]"!
This fluffy texture is the best! <cf>It's understandable that my husband would make an oversized cushion!
Then I'll try my hand at fashion!
I'm going to make a fluffy bunny suit out of cotton wool crystals! <cf> Don't you think it's perfect for the beautiful me?
............
That's a good idea for Varen, isn't it? <cf>It will also help to show off the "[cotton wool crystal]".
<cf>I'm sure my master would be willing to spare you the cost of one piece of clothing.
If you want, I will give you my permission. <cf>Would you like to try making it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh!　Carnera! <cf>I never thought you would say such a thing!
You finally noticed my charm, didn't you? <cf>I thought Carnera was a girl who could talk!
Well then, adventurer! <cf>May I ask you to gather materials for my rabbit suit?
I need you to go to the Minster Hills and get me about <cf>10 tendril threads</cf>!
I'll look for "cotton wool crystals" in the meantime. <cf>It's for my outfit. I have to work hard!
<cf>The "cotton wool crystals" collected by Varen will also be exchanged for luxurious prizes for the adventurers!
Please be patient with my husband's greed and my partner's shortsightedness.
I'm counting on you, adventurer! <cf>Lead me to further brilliance!　Hahaha!
<cf>Make me the best fluffy bunny suit to show off my collection of cotton wool crystals!
Can you please go to the Minster Hills and collect <cf>10 tendril threads</cf>?
I'll collect the "cotton wool crystals. <cf> Let's get it done together, huh?
Oh, thank you, adventurer!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I've got all the materials for the fluffy rabbit suit!
Thanks for your help, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your partner's share!
This yarn and "[cotton wool crystal]" would make a good costume. <cf>If you can make it, that is.
<cf>The "cotton wool crystals" are unstable engram crystals. <cf>It will melt and disappear over time.
Hmm?　Wait a minute, Carnera. <cf> If "[wadding crystals]" disappear, it means that ......
<cf>"rabbit suit" that I'm making, <cf>wouldn't that mean that it will disappear too?
Oops, I was somewhat smooth-mouthed. <cf>I didn't realize it would be noticed before I made it!
I was so close to seeing something hilarious, <cf>but I'm so sorry!
Oh my God!　I had no idea that my rabbit suit was <cf>such a fleeting dream!
However, Varen's idea was a good one. <cf>This is how we gathered a large amount of "[cotton wool crystals]"!
<cf>I would like to thank the adventurers once again, and present them with a thoughtful gift!
This is the <cf>"Adventure Board" which is useful for collecting "cotton wool crystals"!
If you clear the board, you can get an additional <cf>amount of [cotton wool crystals]!
Of course, you can also exchange the "cotton wool crystals" obtained on the "Adventure Board" <cf> for luxurious prizes!
It's a great chance for adventurers! <cf>Please challenge the "Adventure Board"!
<cf>We are still accepting applications for "Wool Crystals"!
Please make full use of the "Adventure Board" and snatch the <cf>gorgeous prizes from the end!
Hello, adventurers! <cf>Are you collecting "Woolly Crystals"?
<cf>Make good use of the "Adventure Board" too! <cf>This is a chance to get a lot of them!
<cf>The more [woad crystals] you collect, the happier everyone will be! <cf>Please keep up the good work!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf> You've come to the right place!
Our master, the King Collector, has given us <cf>a new command!
Our master, the King Collector, is trying to make cushions out of cotton wool crystals.
In any case, "Watage-shou" is so fluffy. <cf>They will be able to make the best fluffy cushions!
Isn't this a dream come true? <cf> You can take a good nap wrapped in fluffy stuff!
However, the "cotton wool crystals" will disappear<cf>after a certain period of time.
The cushions will also disappear, so <cf>the master will eventually wake up on the floor!
Oops, that's another <cf>dream-like</cf> story!
[I'd like to take a nap in <cf>supreme fluff, even if it's only for a limited amount of time["].
What shall we call this without calling it greed? <cf>This is our master's tearful greed!
<cf>Mr. King Collector instructed me to procure fabric for the cushions.
<cf>We need the ultimate fabric that will wrap the fluffiest of cushions and not let go!
I did some research and found that <cf>the best material can be found in a place called "The Floating Island in the Void"!
However, <cf>the floating island in the void</cf> is a place where extremely dangerous monsters appear!
Hahaha!　So!　I'll gather the materials, <cf>and I want you adventurers to do something about the monsters!
You'll need three materials, though, so you'll have to <cf>try</cf> three times to get to the floating island in the void!
While you are fighting, Varen will <cf>somehow</cf> gather the materials!
So please don't worry about this. <cf>Please concentrate on the battle on the floating island in the void!
<cf>We will count the "cotton wool crystals" attached to the materials as having been collected by the adventurers.
This is your chance to get a lot of [cotton wool crystals] as well! <cf>Please do me a favor, adventurers!　Hahaha!
I want to collect materials for cushions on the "floating island in the void". <cf>Will you fight the monsters, adventurer?
Don't worry, I'll sneak along and get the materials for you!
<cf>Take on the floating island in the void!
<cf>I'll need three, so I'll have to go there three times. <cf>But it will be worth it!
<cf>I'll pretend that the "cotton wool crystals" we found together were collected by the adventurers!
<cf>This is your chance to get a lot of [cotton wool crystals]! <cf>Let's go to the floating island in the void!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf> You made it back in one piece, didn't you?
<cf>Thank you so much for all your help on the floating island in the void! <cf>Thank you for helping me complete my mission!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>It looks like I got the material for the fluffy cushion too!
<cf>Even if it's a big, round body that swells to its limit due to the "King Collector's" desire and laziness!
It is splendid!　It will be a <cf> supreme cushion that will support and wrap you in fluff!
Hahaha!　Even if the "cotton wool crystal" disappears, <cf> the fabric of the cushion will remain unbroken!
My husband will at least be able to feel the fluffy remnants. <cf>Thank you very much!
<cf>The "cotton wool crystals" that Varen collected while nearly being extinguished were also the result of the adventurer's efforts!
<cf>We are still accepting applications for "woad crystals"! <cf>Please collect them and exchange them as much as you can!
<cf>We support your adventures and hope you enjoy this opportunity! <cf>I hope you enjoy this opportunity!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Hey, adventurer! <cf>How are you doing?
Thanks to you, we've collected quite a few [cotton wool crystals]! <cf>Thank goodness we're going to be able to fulfill our mission!
<cf>If you have any [cotton wool crystals], you can keep bringing them to us!
We and our gorgeous prizes are waiting for you! <cf>Exchange to your heart's content, haha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of the "Whitecaps"?
<cf>The little pieces that wash across the sea, <cf>carrying the scent of ancient cultures from faraway foreign lands.
Hahaha!　This is romance! <cf>Wouldn't you like to be touched by a glimpse of romance, adventurer?
I am Carnera, a messenger of the <cf>"King Collector," a wealthy man and a great collector!
This time, my master has his eyes on the "Whitecap Jade.
The "Whitecap beads" are small beads that were once prized in faraway foreign lands.
The picture scrolls created from thousands and thousands of beads were elegant works of art depicting the history of the country.
However, the country disappeared in the face of war and disaster, and the scrolls were scattered and lost.
Hahaha!　It seems to have washed up on the <cf>Magna Continent</cf>, perhaps due to the influence of ocean currents!
It is impossible for my master not to take notice of it! <cf>That's why I ran out to collect them!
<cf>He even went so far as to restore the picture scrolls, so I must say he has a greedy spirit that I admire.
<cf>However, however, there were some people who were obstructing my efforts to collect the "white wave balls. <cf>They are the goblins of Minster.
First of all, could you please kill five goblins in <cf>Minster</cf>?
If left unchecked, they may attack anyone with a "Whitecap Tama" <cf> without regard.
Please lend me your help to collect "Whitecap Tama" with peace of mind!　I'm counting on you, hahaha!
<cf> Before we start collecting the "Whitecaps," I need you to kill the goblins for me.
Could you go and kill five goblins in Minster?
They seem to be attacking anyone who has the "Whitecaps" <cf> without regard.
We all want to enjoy collecting "Whitecaps" together! <cf>Lend us your help, Mr. Adventurer, hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf> I see you took down the goblins!
Brilliant work! <cf>Adventurer, indeed!
Now you can all go back to collecting "Whitecaps" <cf> without any worries!
Monsters seem to have taken them away from here and there. <cf>When you defeat the monsters, you will find the "Whitecap Balls"!
Hahaha!　That's how I want you to collect <cf>a lot of [white wave] balls</cf>!
Restoring bead-weaved picture scrolls is my master's hobby. <cf>I won't bother you adventurers!
<cf>We will not be bothered by adventurers! <cf>Please exchange them for gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　The lost romance of a foreign land! <cf>How about playing a part, adventurers?
We want to make it a <cf> wonderful experience for adventurers as well, by collecting <cf> "Whitecaps"!
This is a fun time of year only! <cf>Please get every bit of the gorgeous prizes~!
Hahaha!　Aren't you the adventurer? <cf>"Whitecaps" are piling up one after another!
I was so busy collecting that I even tried my hand at restoring the <cf>emaki</cf> just like my master did!
And what do you think?　A cool and <cf> gallant hero's figure emerged, just like me!
It was just a coincidence. There are a vast number of "Tama of Whitecaps" that can be used to create bead-weaved picture scrolls in any way you like!
If you combine them to your liking, it is no trouble at all to <cf>make a convenient figure emerge</cf>!
Hahaha!　Carnera is a realist. <cf>It's okay to feel a little romantic!
<cf>Maybe the goblins who are taking the "Whitecap Tama" want to make a picture scroll in which they appear?
[Oh, that's right! <cf>The goblins are in trouble, adventurer!
You took them down in "Minster [hillside]" before, didn't you? <cf> But then the same kind of people showed up again!
<cf>The Elder Goblins have emerged to rob us of the "Whitecap Tama," to see what we like!
This time, they are in the "Andorra Basin", and they are obstructing our efforts to collect the <cf>"Whitecap Balls".
I'd like to expand my search, but the <cf>Elder Goblins</cf> are preventing me from doing so.
So there it is!　I want you adventurers to defeat the <cf>Elder Goblins</cf> in the "Andorra Basin!
If we kill 10 of them, they will lose control. <cf>There will be no more obstacles in the way of collecting <cf>"Tama of Whitecaps.
Incidentally, the adventurers can take the <cf> "[Whitecap] beads" that the Elder Goblins have hoarded.
Of course, in exchange, they can also <cf>get</cf> gorgeous prizes!
It's a good deal for adventurers, too! <cf>Take care and go!　Hahaha!
What I want you to defeat are 10 <cf>Elder Goblins</cf> in the Andorra Basin!
<cf>Do you like the "Whitecaps"? <cf> It seems the goblins are collecting them too.
<cf>They can pretend that the adventurers have collected what they have!
We'll make sure everyone's safe, and we'll gather up the "Whitecaps" too! <cf> Isn't that a neat deal, hahaha!
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>You defeated the Elder Goblins, didn't you?
You did a splendid job! <cf>Adventurer, indeed!
<cf>With this, I have no doubt that you'll be making even more progress in collecting "Whitecaps!
The Elder Goblin's "Whitecap Balls" will be <cf>exchanged</cf> for some great prizes for the adventurers!
<cf>But still, we found a lot of them! <cf>The goblins seem to be collecting them with great enthusiasm.
<cf>The "Whitecaps" are indeed beautiful. <cf>It shines like the sweat of my beads!
Hmmm, I can't help but wonder how the goblins feel <cf>when they see it, they want to collect it!
I guess we understand each other because we are similar and perverted. <cf>It is said that like calls like!
Hahaha!　We should treasure our friends, shouldn't we?
Good luck to you, adventurers, in your quest to collect "Whitecaps! <cf>It might be a good idea to cooperate with your friends!
The more monsters you kill, the more <cf>"Whitecaps" you can find!
We also have special bonus quests and <cf>adventure boards</cf>!
If you complete them, you will have a chance to get <cf>a lot of [Tama] of [shiranami] at once!
<cf>My husband continues to work hard on the restoration of the picture scrolls! <cf>We are also releasing luxurious prizes without any strings attached!
<cf>We are still in search of "Tama of Shiranami"! <cf>Please feel free to trade!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>How's your collection of "Whitecap Balls" coming along?
It seems that many monsters have them, so you should be able to find them after <cf>defeating them</cf>.
<cf>Master King Collector also said that there is no need to have too many picture scrolls to restore!
We've got some great prizes waiting for you! <cf>Collect as many as you can and bring them to us!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Don't you think persistent goblins are frowned upon?
I mean, you are not liked. <cf> I'm sorry for your loss, goblin.
Oops, you've got that all wrong! <cf>I'm not a persistent goblin!
<cf>I'm not a goblin, even though I'm a persistent one! <cf>I'm going to be taken down by adventurers, too!
<cf>I'm thinking to myself, "Wouldn't that be fine too?　<cf>I can't deny that I'm thinking that!
<cf>However, I don't want all the work to fall on me. <cf>Let him live for now, Varen.
That's very kind of Carnera! <cf>And I have a favor to ask of you, adventurer!
<cf>I'm sure you've had your share of goblins trying to steal the "Whitecaps" before, haven't you?
We thought we were safe now, but <cf>the same kind of people came out again!
If they've come this far, there may be something in the "[white wave] [tama]" that <cf>attracts</cf> the goblins!
We'll deal with those tactless people first, but that's a topic for another time.
<cf>Travelers and merchants will be attacked for the <cf>Tama of Whitecaps</cf> in the near future.
This time, the Elder Goblins seem to be operating around <cf>"the foot of the mountain in Shizumari.
There are so many of them, and they're not going to go quietly <cf>until we kill about 20 of them</cf>.
We've consulted with the Pioneer Bureau and our master, the King Collector, but I think we need to take action first.
We would like to request the adventurers to take down <cf>20</cf> of them, based on their skill!
We want everyone to enjoy collecting "Whitecaps"! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
It seems that the Elder Goblins who steal the "Whitecap Balls" will appear at the foot of the mountain in Shizumari this time.
<cf>This time there are more of them. <cf>You have to kill 20 of them!
<cf>We'll be fine, adventurers! <cf>We believe in you, hahaha!
Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You killed 20 Elder Goblins!
Amazing feat, sir! <cf>My master would like to thank you as well!
Thanks to you adventurers, everyone can work even harder to collect <cf>"Whitecaps"!
Now that we don't have to worry about goblins anymore, <cf>we can all participate in the collection of "Whitecap Tama" with peace of mind!
We can also feel good about receiving them and exchanging them for <cf>gorgeous prizes!
My husband is also hard at work restoring the bead weaving. <cf>It will be a long time before it is completed.
<cf>Adventurers, please don't worry about it! <cf>Please collect the "beads of the whitecaps" to your heart's content!
If you collect enough to fill your master's body, <cf> you'll get that many gorgeous prizes~!
Hahaha!　I'm sure the "King Collector" will be pleased <cf>with how many we collect!
We are still waiting for the "Tama of Whitecaps". <cf>This is your chance to get all the gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>"Whitecaps" are coming in nicely!
<cf>The floor of the King Collector's room is about to become invisible!
The restoration work hasn't caught up with the restoration work! <cf>Well, don't worry about that!
Collect more and more "Whitecap Tama"! <cf>Luxurious prizes await you adventurers, hahaha!
Hello, adventurers! <cf>Do you know the "petals of [Sei-Kun]"?
Hahaha!　The season of beautiful flowers! <cf>Beautiful like me!　The season of gorgeous flowers!
<cf> I'll share my happiness with you, adventurers! <cf>Enjoy it to the fullest!　Hahaha!
This time, my master has set his sights on the "petals of the blue fragrance".
Just like this me, as beautiful as I am! <cf> It is a lovely petal that smells fragrantly!
<cf> I can't even compare to my partner's delusions. <cf>It's churlish to even think so, it's a beautiful blue flower!
<cf>It is also said to ward off evil, and was once given as a grand wedding gift.
This anecdote is what attracted the interest of our master, the King Collector!
Hahaha!　The King Collector is going to give <cf>"petals of blue fragrance" to the bride and groom!
As many as possible!　And as many as possible! <cf>To bless all the weddings!
To that end, we would like to ask for your help in collecting <cf>"petals of blue fragrance"!
However, there was an unexpected interloper. ......
What a surprise!　It seems that goblins are using "Seichun's petals" as a <cf>tool for fortune-telling!
If nothing is done, they will take away the 'petals of blue fragrance'! <cf> It's a crisis that will cause the beautiful flower to fall!
The beautiful Boku is in danger as well!　Pinch!
Your partner can do whatever he likes, whether it's fortune-telling or sacrifice, <cf> but
But not so with the "petals of Sei-Kun!
Adventurers, first of all, please kill about 10 goblins in "Minster [hillside]"!
After driving the goblins away, let's collect <cf>[flower petals] of [blue fragrance]</cf>! <cf> I'm counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
First of all, I want you to <cf>defeat</cf> 10 goblins in <cf>Minster Hill</cf>!
After you've done that, you can <cf>gather up the [flower petals] of [Seikun] without worry!
Please <cf>please take care of me so that I won't be deprived of these beautiful flowers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>It seems the goblins were successfully vanquished.
I am in awe of your brilliant handiwork~! <cf> Now you can collect the "petals of [Sei-kun]"!
<cf>This is good news for the bride and groom as well as for the "King Collector"!
<cf>A beautiful flower is indispensable for a happy wedding celebration!
No, wait a minute.　If you need beauty, <cf>I can visit all the venues!
You want me to send <cf>varenes in pieces</cf> to all the venues?
It's a bit more work, but <cf>if that's what you want, I'll oblige.
Hahaha!　After all, "Sei-Kun's [flower petals]" is the best! <cf> Let's have adventurers collect more and more!
<cf>More color for the happiness of the bridegroom and bride! <cf>Please lend us your help!
Of course, we will also be offering gorgeous prizes! <cf>There also appear to be materials for crafting "special weapons"!
<cf>Please collect "petals of [Sei-Kun]" and exchange them for luxurious prizes as you wish!
The man I am is beautiful, not beautiful. <cf>Beautiful, not beautiful. Beautiful, not beautiful. ......
......No, there is no way I am not beautiful. <cf>This flower reading seems to have ended in failure!
Let's start from the beginning again! <cf>I am beautiful or I am not!
I am beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ......!
Well, well, well, adventurer. <cf>How dare you stare at a pervert's flower fortune-telling?
You don't have to throw away <cf>your precious time of life</cf>, even though it's a rare sight!
Yes!　Speaking of flower divination, I'm a goblin! <cf> Mr. Adventurer!
The goblins who use "Sei-Kun's petals" to divine flowers <cf>again</cf> stood in our way!
This is the second time!　It seems that the beautiful blue color of the "petals of Seichun" <cf> does not cease to fascinate even the goblins!
Just like that!　This mine!　Just like my own beauty, which <cf>resulted</cf> as "[beautiful]" in the flower fortune-telling!
If you use your partner as a source of divination, the goblins' customs are not to be dismissed.
It seems that during this season, the goblins are actively repeating divination by "Sei-Kun's petals".
Now is the season when the "petals of the blue fragrance" shine the bluest. <cf> That's why it's the perfect time for a wedding celebration!
We can't give it to the goblins! <cf>To truly congratulate everyone on their happiness!
Let us agree with my partner's opinion, which is rare. <cf>Adventurers, please help us!
<cf>The Elder Goblins of the "Andorra Basin" seem to be particularly obsessed with the "petals of [Seikun].
Would you please kill 10 of them?
It would be a disaster if the people who collect the "Sei-Kun's petals" are harmed!
I'm counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
It seems that the Elder Goblins in the Andorra Basin have taken the <cf>"Seichun's Petals!
The wedding celebration will be overshadowed, and the people who collect <cf>[petals of blue fragrance] </cf> will be in danger!
I want you to go and kill <cf>10 Elder Goblins in the Andorra Basin</cf>!　I'm counting on you, haha!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>You killed the Elder Goblins!
<cf>The [petals] of [Sei-kun] were protected! <cf> You look like a legendary hunter wearing a flower crown!
Good work, adventurer. <cf>No wonder Varen said of you, you have done so well!
<cf>When the "petals of the blue fragrance" were given out for wedding celebrations, <cf>that role was filled by the best hunter in the village.
<cf>The head of the hunter was adorned with a crown of flowers, <cf>a role that was honored and celebrated.
The house that was given the "petal of blue fragrance" would be protected by the hunter who was crowned with a crown of flowers.
This is the origin of the legend!
Incidentally, it was also said that the more 'petals of the blue fragrance' that were collected, <cf>the better the hunter.
Perhaps the reason why "King Collector" collects "Sei-Kun's petals" is because he longs to be a hunter!
The plumpness of the master is flattering ....... <cf>Hence, we are showing [our pride] by collecting numbers!
Well, we are not bothering anyone. <cf>The feeling of celebrating the wedding is genuine, so...
Now, now, please collect as many "flower petals of [Seikun]" as you <cf>need</cf>!
<cf>The gorgeous prizes are still waiting for you, adventurers! <cf>Gather as many as you can and bring them to me!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　The beautiful ....... <cf>My enchanting body is even more beautiful!
<cf>Being covered with petals all over my body now, <cf>I am truly an incarnation of timeless beauty ......
<cf>When these petals fall from my body, <cf>I should even be able to see into the future with their movement!
<cf> Approaching the dubious rituals of the perverse is an act tantamount to an abandonment of reason and decency,<cf> Mr. Adventurer!
If you have reason, you look away; if you have decency, you ignore it altogether. <cf>Treat it as if it doesn't exist and you will be at peace.
Don't worry. I don't let him use the "flower petals of Sei-kun". <cf> What is on your partner's body is just a flower.
However!　<cf>There are some things we can't just stand by and watch, even if it's the same ritual!
Especially the large-scale rituals that Mook and his friends plan to perform using <cf>the petals of the blue fragrance</cf>!
The mooks on the "Litse Trade Road" are gathering large quantities of <cf>"Seichun's petals"!
It seems that they intend to perform some kind of ritual. <cf>A suspicious atmosphere is now in the air.
If it's a goblin-like flower divination, but if it's a ritual, I can only imagine some sinister intentions.
We don't want to lose the "flower petals of Sei-kun," and <cf>we don't want Mook and the others to attack the town!
Adventurer!　Can you <cf>stop</cf> the Mooks' attempts?
We ask that you take down 15 Mooks on the Litze Trading Road!
We will work together with our masters and the Pioneer Bureau to take <cf>measures</cf> against them!
Let's hurry up and do the right thing!　I'm counting on you, adventurers!
I want you to go and kill 15 mooks on the Litze Trading Road!
I can't let them use my 'Sei-Kun's petals' for their dubious rituals!
Mwah, petals danced from my body. ...... <cf>This must indicate a victory for the adventurer!
Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>It looks like you successfully thwarted Mook's ritual!
Thank you, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Thanks to you, there was no disturbance whatsoever!
<cf>My husband was very happy to see that the "petals of blue fragrance" had been gathered without incident.
Speaking of being pleased, the bridegroom and the bride also <cf>received words of thanks!
<cf>The city's nuptials were made more colorful with "Seikun's 'Hanaben' (flower petals)"! <cf> A beautiful scene full of smiles is spreading!
<cf>It started out as my husband's usual idea, but <cf>many people seem to be pleased with it!
<cf>This is all thanks to the cooperation of our adventurers. <cf>Many thanks!
Hahaha! <cf>We hope to celebrate many more!
Gorgeous prizes for the adventurers! <cf>Vivid blessings to those who are getting married!
Let's bring happiness to everyone!　Hahaha!
<cf>We are still waiting for the "flower petals of [Sei-kun]"! <cf>Have you done the exchange yet?
<cf>We have also prepared a gorgeous prize to make a "special weapon"! <cf>Please collect as many as you can and exchange them to your heart's content~!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I'm still collecting more [flower petals] of [Seikun]!
The "King Collector" has a good reputation! <cf>It seems that the bride and groom and their relatives have also thanked us!
<cf>They're getting thanks from the bride, groom, and their families! <cf>The "King Collector" is giving me a difficult look!
Well, you needn't worry about it! <cf>Let's collect "petals of [Seikun]" and make everyone happy!
Hello, adventurers! <cf> Have you ever heard of the "King Collector Coin"?
Our master made these coins without our permission, so <cf>we don't want them being used in the store!
If we don't collect them, we'll get scolded by all kinds of people. <cf>I'd like your help if you don't mind!　Hahaha!
<cf>My husband has his eye on the "King Collector Coin" this time.
Well, I guess it's more like he had to<cf>......<cf>not so much that he set his eyes on it, but rather that he had to.
After all, the master made the coin himself!
It does not look like a gold coin as far as I glanced at it. <cf>The reality is that it is a toy made by my master's hobby!
He wanted to experience the feeling of being on the receiving end of a collectible just once.
He spent a lot of his own money to make a large number of coins of no particular value!
The other day, <cf>a lot of those "King Collector Coins" were stolen!
I'm afraid I'll be scolded from various places if they are treated as treasures or used for shopping<cf>!
That's why I've been <cf>ordered</cf> to recover the "King Collector Coin"!
Adventurers, please cooperate! <cf>Of course, rewards will be provided!
<cf>We will exchange the number of "King Collector Coins" collected for <cf>gorgeous prizes!
I heard that bandits in the Andorra Basin have <cf>"King Collector Coins".
Would you please defeat about five of them and collect the coins? <cf>Thank you for your help, hahaha!
It seems the bandits in the Andorra Basin are carrying <cf>"King Collector Coins".
Let's collect it first! <cf>Go and take down five bandits!
<cf>Master King Collector is in a great hurry this time! <cf>We'll be waiting for your good news!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thanks for your hard work in defeating the bandits!
Thank you for your quick response! <cf>Adventurer, you are indeed very good at what you do!
Oh?　It looks like the "King Collector Coin" you recovered is <cf>glowing</cf>.
Or rather, it's glowing so brightly that it's dazzling, isn't it? <cf>I don't know if I should say this, but you're very assertive!
<cf>My master made it glow as an added bonus because he thought it would be lonely with a mere coin!
By the way, when you bite the coin, it glows the strongest!
I don't bite coins, but for what?
What for, you ask me?
Even I don't know what it means, but I'm sure it's just <cf>"King Collector's" own obsession!
In the first place, it's a situation <cf>where he collects things that he made himself<cf>, which also makes no sense!
Please bear with us, adventurers. <cf>We will not let you lose anything!
Oh, yes, as a token of collecting the "King Collector Coin," <cf>please take this "Whip of Love, Deep Scarlet Limit" with you.
It's an accessory to <cf>gently instruct the person who took the coin!
<cf>"King Collector" went to great lengths to tell you that it is not good to take things that belong to others!
If you have time to do that, you <cf>might</cf> want to think of a way to collect it, but please don't mention it!
Please note that "The Whip of Love: Deep Scarlet - Limited" will be <cf>collected after a certain period of time!
If you complete certain adventure boards, you will be able to obtain the same type of accessory that can be used <cf> indefinitely!
We hope you will enjoy <cf>the comfort of wearing the "Whip of Love: Deep Scarlet - Limited" as a trial period!
Now, let's start punishing the wrongdoers and collecting the <cf>coins</cf>!
Please collect as many "King Collector Coins" as you can and bring them to us!
Please enjoy <cf>the adventurers' chance to exchange them for gorgeous prizes and <cf>don't miss out on any of these great opportunities~!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>Have you collected your "King Collector Coins"?
After all, a lot of them have been stolen. <cf>We're trying to find out who has them and where!
<cf>We may need some help from adventurers, but we'd like you to let us go in exchange for some great prizes!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Some bandits who <cf>stole</cf> the "King Collector Coins" got caught!
They were found <cf>tattered up, like they'd been attacked by wild dogs or something!
I heard they were <cf> attacked by a pack of highland foxes and ran away in a heap!
<cf>I guess I deserved a little punishment for stealing something that belonged to someone else.
<cf>It seems that they were attacked rather vigorously, <cf>and I felt a little sorry for them!
It seems that the "King Collector Coin" was <cf>the cause~!
This coin glows for no reason at all, but <cf>it shines even more brightly when it is bitten!
When the monster bites it, it glitters and shines just as brightly as it does when the monster bites it!
Hahaha!　Then the Highland Fox seemed to be attracted by the light.
The "King Collector Coins" they had been storing up were <cf>taken away by the Highland Fox's nest!
Well, I had no idea that my master's hobby would <cf>involve</cf> monsters!
If the Highland Fox eats the coin or something, <cf>you're going to be in a bit of trouble!
I would feel sorry for them <cf>eating such silly things and <cf>getting sick to their stomachs!
Could you <cf>get rid of the Highland Foxes in "The Hill of God's Watchful Eye" and collect the coins?
I think if you take down 10 of them, they won't come near you anymore!
Even though we are dealing with bandits, it is an undeniable fact that they attacked people and took <cf>their coins!
Please <cf> kindly give Highland Fox some guidance~!
The Highland Fox at "God's Watch Hill" is collecting <cf>"King Collector Coins"!
I need you to kill 10 Highland Foxes and collect the <cf>coins!
It would be extra trouble if they eat you or something! <cf>I'm just trying to get a handle on it while I can!　Hahah!
Hahah!　You <cf>have</cf> gotten rid of the Highland Fox already, haven't you?
You are indeed an adventurer~! <cf> We were also able to recover the "King Collector Coin"!
But still, "King Collector Coins" can be found in <cf>so many places!
Not only the possibility that someone else has them, but it seems that <cf>we have to take monsters into account as well!
I have just advised my husband to give me a little <cf> allowance because I am indeed overworked!
Can I pay you in ["]coins? I couldn't help but smile <cf>when he replied, "["]"!
Hahaha!　The "King Collector"-sama is a <cf>daredevil, isn't he?
I'll properly exchange you, adventurer, for a gorgeous prize! <cf> Don't worry!
Please continue to <cf>help us collect the "King Collector Coins"!
We look forward to your adventures~!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>It looks like you've collected "King Collector Coins"!
Don't forget to exchange them for gorgeous prizes! <cf>Get every last one of those prizes you're after!
<cf>I'll be glad if you keep bringing them to me! <cf>We won't let the adventurers lose any money, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I've got a problem with the "King Collector Coin"!
As you know, the "King Collector Coin" is <cf>just something our master made up on his own!
They look like gold coins, but in reality they have <cf>no value whatsoever</cf>!
Even adventurers would probably be troubled<cf>if they were to receive this as a reward for a request, wouldn't they?
But it seems <cf>this</cf> got mixed up in the prize money in the arena!
What if the prize you received after a beautiful victory in a fierce battle <cf>was a fake coin that glowed for no particular reason?
If it were me, I might destroy the <cf> arena in the name of "King Collector"!
Hahaha!　That's a piece of cake for Carnera, isn't it?
Even if it doesn't go that far, I think people usually get angry!
I'm sure the "King Collector" will be scolded from various places for being a nuisance!
I wish my husband would have been punished <cf>that severely</cf>, but he was not.
I feel sorry for the contestants in the arena. <cf>It is also unwilling to inconvenience you.
Adventurers, could you go ahead and conquer the "Rush Battle - First Level" and collect your <cf> prize money secretly?
We might get scolded as collateral damage, <cf>We're counting on you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf> I asked you to clear the "Rush Battle - First Stage"!
It looks like there's a "King Collector Coin" mixed in with the prize money<cf>. I want you to collect them first!
If they find out, I'm going to get in trouble with a lot of people! <cf>Please, think of it as helping people!　Hahaha!
<cf>Congratulations on conquering the "Rush Battle, First Level! <cf>That's great, adventurer!
Your success was well received by the audience! <cf>Well done, adventurer!
<cf>I'm glad we were able to recover the "King Collector Coins" and clean up the mess before it turned into a riot!
<cf>Truly, my master's eccentricity and boisterousness is<cf> quite troubling, isn't it?
Hahaha!　I understand your desire to make a coin <cf>to honor yourself!
Like the beautiful me, "King Collector" has a <cf>rom-scratch</cf> romantic heart!
<cf>I must agree with you that my master and my partner are on the same level.
<cf> Or perhaps Varen is better than him, as long as he doesn't spread unnecessary confusion.
Hahaha!　I don't feel bad about the praise!
Thanks to you too, adventurer! <cf> Keep collecting those "King Collector Coins"!
I don't know how many you've made, but it seems <cf>you haven't collected all of them yet!
<cf>We have a proper reward for all you adventurers who have collected!
Please get your "King Collector Coins" and bring them to us!
Gorgeous prizes await adventurers. <cf>Please exchange them and enjoy!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>How's your "King Collector Coin" collection going?
Bring me lots more! <cf> I'd like you to try on the "Whip of Love" too!
<cf>The "Love Whip Deep Scarlet" will be collected after a certain period of time.
If you want an accessory that can be used indefinitely, try <cf>the Adventure Board</cf>!
It doesn't matter if you run out of gorgeous prizes! <cf>Collect lots of coins!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>Have you ever heard of "Spilling Star Sand"?
You collect small grains of sand in the shape of stars with <cf>a small wish: ......
Truly ephemeral!　Beautiful!　Romantic! <cf>Let's enjoy the excitement together, hahaha!
This time, my husband has his eye on "Spilt Star Sand".
<cf> I'm talking about the beautiful star-shaped sand that falls from the sky at this time of the year.
It is said that if you collect the "Sand of Spilling Stars" and fill a bag with it, <cf>your wish will come true!
Also, some of them have unusual shapes and colors, and are <cf>preciously valued as rare items!
Hahaha!　<cf>"King Collector" wouldn't shut up if he heard that, would he?
He's been collecting <cf>"Spilt Star Sand" to get his hands on the rare ones!
Of course, it is not good to take all of it for yourself. <cf>We will distribute the surplus to the people of the town.
<cf>I'm sure everyone enjoys collecting the "Sand of Spilled Stars".
For now, I want adventurers to collect <cf>a lot</cf> of "Sand of Spilling Stars"!
It seems that there are goblins living in the places where the "Sand of Spilled Stars" falls.
They're having trouble collecting it, too.
Please kill 10 goblins in the "Minster Hills" and keep them away from the <cf>"Sand of Spilling Stars"!
Even if we're going to look for the rare ones, first we need to make sure everyone can collect <cf>"Sand of Spilled Stars" safely!
It's on your shoulders, adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your help, haha!
I need you to kill 10 goblins in the "Minster Hills" and keep them away from the <cf>"Sand of Spilling Stars"!
Since everyone is to be gathered and asked to do a favor, <cf>safety must come first!
First of all, I need your help to collect it safely! <cf>Thank you for your help, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for defeating the goblins!
You've done an excellent job! <cf>Now you can collect the "Spilling Star Sand"!
Pray for family safety and health. Pray for love and academic success. <cf> You will be able to make a lot of wishes!
Hahaha!　<cf>The amulets filled with "Spilling Star Sand" are a seasonal tradition!
We also make amulets out of leftover "Spilling Star Sand" and give them out <cf>to the people of the town!
<cf>My husband collects the rare "Spilt Star Sands" of unusual shapes and colors.
Other than that, I hand them out to everyone and try not to interfere with <cf>their requests.
<cf>By the way, my husband does the sorting of the grains of sand himself. <cf>I don't want to help him with that too!
Hahaha!　Making amulets is fun, too! <cf>I want to come up with a design that everyone will be happy with!
Adventurers, don't worry about anything, just go out and collect lots of <cf>Sand of Spilling Stars</cf>!
We have a great selection of prizes to exchange for the <cf>Sand of Spilling Stars</cf>!
Please collect as many as you can and exchange them to your heart's content~!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>How is your collection of "Spilt Star Sand" going?
<cf>I think you can get it by defeating monsters, since it's often attached to their bodies!
Collect as many as you can and bring them here! <cf>Luxury prizes await you, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Have you gathered the "Spilling Star Sand"?
It's as small as a grain of sand, but it's properly shaped like a star. <cf>It makes me feel excited to see it!
<cf>I think I could be as bright as a star if I scattered it all over my body!
I can see that you are simply going to be covered in sand.
You don't have to go to the trouble of using "Spilling Star Sand", sand from the beach or something like that should be enough!
Hahaha!　I see! <cf>I guess that means my beauty doesn't choose sand!
<span size="Big">Sand has the right to choose!
But, I'm not so sure!　You can't give a bandit the right to <cf>choose</cf> the "Sand of Spilling Stars"!
It seems that the bandits have taken away the "Sand of Spilling Stars" that the children of the town have found!
<cf>They are not beautiful people to take away a small request!
We cannot leave this behind. <cf>It would be a disaster if the damage were to spread.
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can we ask you to take down the bandits that appear in the Andorra Basin?
We will prepare amulets for the children! <cf>We don't want to leave them disappointed!
<cf>Protect the children's dreams and wishes by retrieving the "Sand of Spilled Stars"!　I'm counting on you, hahaha!
Bandits from the Andorra Basin have intercepted <cf>the children's Sand of Spilled Stars</cf>!
It's not beautiful, intercepting little wishes, is it? <cf>Adventurers, take down the bandits with your own hands!
<cf>Retrieve the "Sand of Spilling Stars" and protect the children's dreams! <cf>Only an adventurer can do that!　I'm counting on you!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>It's a beautiful accomplishment, thank you!
Defeating bandits and recapturing the "Spilled Star Sand"! <cf>Great work, sir!
<cf>The "Sand of Spilled Stars" has returned safely to the children!
Not only did it return, but it has grown to a huge amount!
Actually, among the "Spilt Star Sands" collected by the children, there were some rare ones with unusual shapes.
The "King Collector" has agreed to <cf>exchange</cf> a large amount of "Sand of Spilling Stars" with them!
<cf>That's a lot of sand! <cf>It was so much that he had a truck full of it!
<cf>I let my husband take it home with him because it was such a nuisance. <cf>The children were allowed to take as many good luck charms as they wanted!
<cf>Everyone looked so happy with their hands full of good luck charms!
Both hands full of requests!　Beautiful, isn't it?
<cf>It was a great result for the children and the "King Collector" to smile!
It was all thanks to the adventurers! <cf>Thank you very much!
<cf>We are still accepting applications for "Spilled Star Sand". <cf>We have some great prizes for you!
May you all make a wish upon a star. <cf>Please help us!
I hope the adventurers' wishes come true, too! <cf>"Spilled Star Sand", bring as much as you can!
Defeat monsters and try <cf>adventure boards!
You can get it from various places! <cf>If you find "Sand of Spilled Stars", bring it to me!
We've got lots of great prizes in store for you! <cf> Feel free to trade it all away!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>You've been collecting "Spilled Star Sand" very well!
You've collected so many that even the "King Collector" is <cf>squealing with delight!
My husband is manually checking each and every grain for <cf> unusual shapes and colors!
It takes a lot of patience and effort, but <cf>it's all for the sake of rare collectibles!
When he finds even a single piece, he is very happy, <cf>including all the hard work he has put in up to that point!
Hahaha!　I can't help but <cf>feel</cf> that the harder you work, the more you are rewarded!
<cf>I'm a little troubled when it leads to something dangerous!
<cf>The same rumors are circulating about collecting "spilt star sand"!
The harder it is to collect, the easier it is to make a wish come true!
So some young people are going out of their way to go to dangerous places to look for the "Sand of Spilled Stars".
<cf>Have you ever heard of the "foot of the mountain of calm" on the Baha Mar Plateau? <cf>How dare they go to that place?
It's a little too dangerous, so I thought I'd stop them before they get there.
Adventurers, can you help us defeat the Elder Goblins at the foot of the Mountains of Calm?
If we see the adventurers fight and hear their stories of hardship, <cf>we should all know that it's dangerous!
Before anyone really goes <cf>Please, Mr. Adventurer!　Hahaha!
I want you to take down the Elder Goblins in <cf>The Foothills of Calm</cf> and let everyone know that it's dangerous there!
If you get the <cf>Sand of Spilled Stars</cf>, you can include that in the amount you've collected, Mr. Adventurer!
<cf>Please do me a favor before the young people really go!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　That's what I'm talking about, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You don't even keep the monsters of "The Foot of the Pacifying Mountains" at bay, do you?
<cf>You've done a brilliant job, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>The people of the town have heard of your success!
<cf>It seems they now understand that the foot of the Mountains of Calm is a dangerous place.
<cf>I'm only saying that because you're an adventurer, you're fine! <cf>They were all talking about how we shouldn't go there.
I want to make your wish come true, but if you get hurt <cf>that would be a loss for all of us.
<cf>They decided to go to a place near the city and collect <cf>sand of spilled stars</cf>!
I understand that you are very passionate about it, but safety comes first.
Please be moderate in your requests and your enthusiasm for them. <cf>Rashness and recklessness are strictly forbidden!
<cf>My husband has been so busy looking for rare items that he almost collapses every day.
Hahaha!　<cf>There's no point in saying anything to the "King Collector"!　Let's leave him alone!
Adventurers, don't worry about it <cf>as long as you collect the "Spilled Star Sand"!
<cf>There are still many more great prizes to be won! <cf>Please exchange to your heart's content~!
You can get it by defeating monsters. <cf>Don't challenge reckless opponents just because you can!
<cf>Collect as many as you can, and trade them in for gorgeous prizes as you go! <cf>I hope you adventurers enjoy it too, haha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you ever heard of the "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night"?
Once a year, there comes a <cf>holy night</cf> when everyone makes a wish!
<cf>I'm sure there's a nice present for you too, adventurers! <cf>Enjoy it to your heart's content!　Hahaha!
My husband has his eye on the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" this time!
<cf>Small and dainty, yet vibrant in appearance. <cf>It is a lovely crimson ornament!
It was used to decorate a healthy young tree and to wish for the growth of children during the <cf>Holy Night Festival!
Hahaha!　And it's a lovely night when children are given many <cf>gifts</cf>!
However, the original form of this festival <cf>is rarely seen anymore!
This is because the "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night" is rare and <cf>disappears like snow over time!
Only the custom of gift-giving has remained, and <cf>alternatives are used to decorate the young trees. ......
However, when they hear that they are rare and hard to find, <cf>the collector's spirit of the master will not be silenced!
Hahaha!　I'm going to collect "Merry Red of the Holy Night" and <cf>revive the real festival of the Holy Night!
In the season when the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" is found, a monster called <cf>"The Snow-capped Boa" will appear!
Adventurers, first of all, would you please go to the "Minster Hills" and kill the <cf>Snow-covered Boa</cf>?
We'll give you a present for your accomplishment!
There are <cf>rumors</cf> that they have the Merry Red of the Holy Night, so we want to check it out first!
<cf>To give everyone a real Holy Night! <cf>Thanks for your help, adventurers!　Hahaha!
<cf>"Snow-capped Boa" will appear with you during the season of collecting "Holy Night Merry Red"!
Can you <cf>first</cf> take down one of the snow-covered boas in the "Minster Hills"?
When you're done, I'll <cf>present</cf> you adventurers with a nice present!　Look forward to it, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf> You took down the "Snow-covered Boa"!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>A good start, sir!
Now, as promised. <cf>"The Spirit of Winter - Limited" outfit will be given to the adventurers!
It seems to be a <cf> standard costume design for the season when "Merry Red of the Holy Night" can be found!
The King Collector wants to <cf>re-create</cf> all the festivities of the Holy Night, including the costume!
Please note that the "Winter Spirit - Limited" costumes will be <cf>retrieved</cf> after the festival is over!
Costumes that are not limited to a specific period are <cf>available at the Souvenir Exchange. Please take advantage of it!
The more festive the festival is, the more you will receive a medal for <cf>collecting the "Merry Red of the Holy Night"!
The kids seem to be happy too. <cf>Master's greed is useful sometimes!
Hahaha!　Well then, let's get serious about collecting <cf>"Merry Red of the Holy Night"!
<cf>"Merry Red of the Holy Night" is a beautiful thing, you know. <cf>Monsters like Boa seem to be interested in it.
They seem to take them in their mouths, or get them stuck on their bodies and <cf>collect them</cf>!
People in the past went through a lot of trouble<cf> to collect them, hahaha!
To ease their hardships, some say that they dressed up in gorgeous costumes and <cf>everyone made the town lively!
Please try the "Spirit of Winter - Limited" and enjoy <cf> yourselves!
Hahaha!　It would be great if you could <cf>show off your individuality while looking for the "Merry Red of the Holy Night"!
The "Merry Red of the Holy Night" that you collect will be <cf>exchanged here for a gorgeous prize~!
<cf>We have a lot of great gifts for adventurers! <cf>We've got plenty to choose from, so don't hesitate!
<cf>The collection of "Merry Reds" is part of the festivities! <cf>Adventurers, enjoy yourselves to the fullest!
Let's wear our costumes, exchange gifts, and <cf>make this the best Holy Night ever!　Hahaha!
Adventurers!　<cf>Are you collecting enough Merry Reds for the Holy Night?
We can exchange them for some great prizes, so <cf>please keep collecting and bringing them in!
<cf>Wouldn't you like to enjoy some unique costumes? <cf>Let's all make the Holy Night merry together, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Is the "Merry Redeemer of the Holy Night" gathering?
<cf>We've prepared some young trees for decoration to make the festivities more festive!
The "Merry Redeemers of the Sacred Night" and <cf>gifts</cf> are essential to the Sacred Night Festival!
And <cf>a magnificent young tree for decorating the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" is also indispensable~!
It is our wish that the children will grow up to be as straight <cf> and big as these young trees!
Not only us, but I am sure that each family has its own young tree!
However, there was an unexpected obstacle in our way!
It's the "snow-covered boa"! <cf>Young trees and buds are their favorite food!
<cf>They also put the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" in their mouths, <cf>which is a real problem!
However!　On the other hand, if we can defeat <cf>the snow-covered boa</cf>, everything will be all right!
The young trees will be protected, and we can get the "Merry Red of the Holy Night". <cf>This is the best present for everyone who enjoys the festival!
If the young trees are eaten up, next year we will not be able to hold the Holy Night Festival!
Please help us not only to collect the "Merry Red of the Holy Night", but also to protect the festival in the future!
Would you please kill about <cf>7 snow-covered boas in the <cf>Andorra Basin</cf>?
That should protect the young trees! <cf>I'm asking for everyone's sake, adventurer!　Hahaha!
<cf>I need you to take out about seven of the snow-covered boas in the Andorra Basin.
They'll devour the young trees used for the festival. <cf>We need to punish them for next year and beyond!
<cf>Don't forget to exchange the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" for some gorgeous prizes, too!　Hahaha!
Thank you!　Thanks to you adventurers, <cf>the young trees for the festival are protected!
Now everyone can <cf>decorate the Merry Red Night</cf> without worrying!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>My thanks to you as well!
<cf>A gift for the young tree in the Merry Red Night. <cf>After all, it is an essential part of this festival!
Incidentally, the glow of the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" is said to be a light to ward off evil.
They decorated the young trees and children with the holy light to keep bad things away from them.
Hahaha!　Then it makes sense for the "King Collector" to collect <cf>"Merry Red of the Holy Night"!
The more the city is decorated with "Merry Reds of the Holy Night", <cf>the more the children can sleep in peace!
It's just a coincidence of my husband's greed and indulgence, but <cf>Vaaren does say some nice things sometimes!
Parents <cf>may place gifts under their children's pillows, and we wish them good dreams!
That's why we need the "Merry Red of the Holy Night"! <cf>Let's collect as many as we can before the shine fades!
<cf>Let's collect as many of them as we can before they fade away!
<cf>We are in the midst of the winter season. <cf>Please enjoy the costumes and accessories if you like!
<cf>Please collect "Merry Red of the Holy Night" and exchange them for <cf>gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>"Merry Red of the Holy Night" is still waiting for you!
<cf>We've got plenty of great prizes to give away! <cf>It's like a present for you adventurers!
<cf>They're just a little bit of fun, and we're going to have a lot of fun with the costumes. <cf>Enjoy the festivities, including the costumes!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thanks to the adventurers, <cf>"Merry Redeemer's Night" is in full swing!
<cf>The kids are happy to see the decorations in various places!
My husband is also very happy. <cf>Thank you, Mr. Adventurer!
Now that the decorations are in place, we are rushing to prepare <cf>gifts</cf> for the children!
Hahaha!　<cf>The King Collector loves to collect and give them away!
Often, when people are interested in his collection, he gives it away <cf>generously</cf>!
I can release my collections in the name of giving them away. <cf>It seems to be a great festival for my husband!
<cf>Although it's great to see the town so excited, <cf>some of the customers seem to be in a bit of a bind!
<cf>An increasing number of people have told me that they have seen the "snow-covered boa. <cf>It seems that the number is increasing.
<cf>If they get excited by the festive atmosphere and attack someone, it would be a big problem!
They want to take them all out in one fell swoop before they cause a ruckus.
What we'd like you to do, adventurers, is to take down <cf>20 snow-covered boas</cf>.
I know it's a rather large number, but I thought this would be a good opportunity to get rid of all the anxiety.
Hahaha!　I want the kids to receive their <cf>gifts with peace of mind, you know?
The "snow-covered boa" in question <cf>seems to be at the foot of the Mount of Calm.
<cf>The Merry Red of the Holy Night should be gathering in abundance. <cf>Please do your part to defeat the snow-covered boa!
I need you to take down the <cf>Snow-covered Boa</cf> at the foot of the Mountains of Calm in the Baha Mar Plateau.
The target is 20!　I know it's a bit of a challenge, but <cf>I'm sure the adventurers will be able to handle it!
We should be able to get a lot of "Merry Reds of the Holy Night", and <cf>adventurers, you'll get some great prizes!
Good work, adventurer! <cf>Thanks for defeating the "Snow-covered Boa!
Thank you for defeating a large number of them, adventurer! <cf>We are very impressed with your skill!
<cf>We can now enjoy the festivities of the Holy Night without any trouble. <cf>We must prepare some gifts for you, too!
Hahaha!　<cf>That we can all enjoy the festivities together is the best present I could have received from an adventurer!
<cf>A brilliant analogy, even for a partner! <cf>That is truly the best present~!
I'm sure <cf>everyone will be talking about the festival and the adventurers <cf>next year and after that!
Now, we are still waiting for the "Merry Red of the Holy Night" <cf>!
<cf>Are you ready to redeem your prizes? <cf>Please accept the gifts, adventurers!
Hahaha!　It's a festival after all! <cf>We want adventurers to enjoy themselves as much as possible!
<cf>We want you to enjoy yourselves to the fullest! <cf>It's sure to be a memorable winter's day!
Let's make a wish on this holy night! <cf>May they all come true together!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers!　You can bring as many "Holy Night Merry Reds" as you <cf>want</cf>!
We'll even try on some costumes appropriate for the Holy Night! <cf>It would be great if we could all get together to celebrate the festivities!
Don't forget to exchange your gifts for great prizes! <cf>It's a great gift!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you ever heard of "Welcoming Spring"?
New beginnings!　New challenges!　New me! <cf> Let's celebrate the festive flowers of congratulations!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband has set his sights on "welcoming spring flowers.
A lucky charm to celebrate new beginnings in a distant foreign land. <cf>The flower has a reddish, congratulatory hue.
<cf>They are decorated everywhere, from the entrance to the inside of a box filled with food.
<cf>It seems these have washed up on the Magna continent as well. <cf>"King Collector" wants to collect them!
<cf>If the city is decorated with many "welcoming flowers", <cf>everyone will be in a festive mood!
Sometimes, the master's congratulations come in handy. <cf>Please send us your "Welcome Flowers" as well, adventurers!
It is said that when looking for "spring flowers", it is customary to first hunt for ulibis to <cf>invigorate</cf> the season.
<cf>The "welcoming spring flowers" are vivid and beautiful, you know! <cf> Excited Uribo gnaws them and destroys them!
<cf> Starting with the defeat of Uribo may be the wisdom of the ancients!
Can you go to the "Sea Rhyme Meadow" and <cf>defeat</cf> five Uribos?
<cf>We'll start collecting "welcoming spring flowers"! <cf> Let's go with a bang like the new us, hahaha!
<cf> When collecting the 'spring flowers,' <cf> the first step is to defeat Uribo.
We don't want the ulibos to swallow or destroy the flowers!
Come back here when you're done. <cf>Now, the celebratory event is about to begin!　Hahaha!
Well done, adventurer! <cf>That was perfect, taking down Uribo!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Thank you, Adventurer!
Well then, let's start collecting "welcoming [spring][flowers]"!
Actually, it is said that the person who collects the most "Haru (spring) flowers" will be respected as a person of good fortune.
<cf>They also call him the "Spring Caller," and when the master learned of this, there was no way he would keep quiet about it.
Hahaha!　<cf>Ha ha! He is absolutely determined to be the "Spring Caller!　Congratulations on your name, isn't it?
Yes, congratulations indeed. <cf>Please join us, adventurers!
Of course, we will exchange your collected "spring flowers" for <cf>gorgeous prizes!
This is the only time you can enjoy it! <cf>Adventurers can also enjoy the festive season!
The more "Welcome [Spring][Flower]" you collect, the more you can enjoy this special chance!
Please join in with my master's amusements, and don't miss out on the <cf>gorgeous prizes!
Hahaha!　Mr. Adventurer! <cf>Have you gathered the "welcoming flowers"?
Various monsters seem to be attracted to them and take them away.
If you defeat ulibis, skyfish, and horngoats,<cf> you should be able to collect more and more!
The more we collect, the more we can exchange for great prizes! <cf>Don't hesitate to take it, haha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>"Welcome [Spring][Flower]" is coming in nicely!
The more I see, the more I congratulate! <cf> The more I look at them, the more celebratory I feel!
New beginnings, new challenges, new Boku......
<span size="Big">Congratulations!　And beautiful! </>
It's your partner who should be congratulated. <cf>That's right. Mr. Adventurer.
However, I can't help but feel <cf>excited by the bright colors of "welcoming [spring][flowers]"!
The exotic scene of these decorating the streets must be filled with a certain air of elegance!
Hahaha!　I'm sure the King Collector's desire to collect is aroused as well!
And the <cf>"King of Spring Calling" honor is given to the person who collects the most "welcoming [spring] flowers!
My husband wants to be the "Spring Caller" from morning till night!　He is always begging me to be the "Spring Caller" from morning till night!
But then..!　<cf>An unexpected rival has appeared!
His name is [--]<span size="Big">Skyfish! </>
The skyfish that appear in the "Minster Hills" are swallowing up every <cf>"spring flower"!
At this rate, Skyfish is going to be the biggest collector of flowers!
The "King Collector" is also worried <cf>about the appearance of a strong rival!
No matter what, Skyfish will never be called <cf>"You, the Spring Caller,"</cf> but he will be the one who collects the most. ......
<cf>His master will not allow him to fall behind in the "most collector" category.
Hahaha!　For the sake of the "King Collector,"<cf>could you please lend me the help of an adventurer?
I want you to <cf>defeat</cf> five Skyfish in the <cf>Minster Hills</cf>!
Even if we put aside my husband's selfishness, we must not put those who are collecting <cf>spring flowers</cf> in danger!
We <cf>request</cf> the help of adventurers!
We don't want Skyfish to become the <cf>"Spring Caller" by collecting "spring flowers!
In order to safely and securely collect the "spring flowers," <cf>please do me a favor, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Thank you for defeating the skyfish!
Thanks to you adventurers, <cf>"King Collector"-sama seems to be relieved.
Now I don't have to worry about <cf>"The Spring Caller"</cf> telling me what to do every time we see each other!
I would like to thank you again, Mr. Adventurer!
The "Spring Caller" brings good fortune and is respected as a man of good fortune.
He was invited as a guest of honor on various occasions, and <cf>sometimes even rose to power.
My husband doesn't seem <cf> to be interested in such things at all.
Hahaha!　The King Collector is a genuine collector.
He said that as long as he has "collected the most,"<cf> he doesn't need anything else.
I don't know whether to be selfless or greedy!
The collected "[spring][welcome][flower]" is <cf> distributed to everyone in town!
The festive colors that celebrate new beginnings and new beginnings <cf>are receiving a favorable reception.
Aside from my husband's greed and desire for honor, <cf>adventurers are also expressing their gratitude!
Of course, we have not neglected the gorgeous prizes! <cf>Please exchange them without hesitation~!
Hahaha!　We are still accepting applications for the "Welcome [Spring][Flower]"!
Please defeat the target monsters and collect as many as you can! <cf>We are always waiting for you, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>How are you getting on with your "Welcome Spring" and "Flower" collecting?
The target monsters are in various places, so <cf>please try to defeat them as much as you can!
The more you collect, the more you can exchange them for <cf>great prizes!　Congratulations!
Let's celebrate <cf>something new</cf> while having fun, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for collecting the "[spring][welcome][flowers]"!
The more I look at them, the more vivid and beautiful they are! <cf>And the more I look at them, the more vivid and beautiful they are!
<cf>The colors of "welcoming spring flowers" are unique to this time of year. <cf> Soon it will be gone in a short time.
<cf>To start a new chapter, do not leave behind the old and look forward to the future. <cf>Maybe this is the meaning behind it.
<span size="Big">I'm impressed! </>
What a beautiful and heartbreaking story! <cf>I can't believe that such feelings are contained in each fragile flower!
No wonder it attracts the hearts of monsters! <cf>Don't you think so?　Adventurer!
I apologize for my rambling, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>"I'm having trouble with the 'welcoming of spring' and 'flowers'.
The horngoats of "God's Watching Hill" are taking the "spring flowers" with them.
<cf>They decorate their beds with "spring flowers. <cf> If that were all, it would be quaint.
<cf>There are stories that people are taking things that are displayed in the city or collected by others.
We can't overlook the fact that people are being harmed for the sake of "welcoming spring flowers.
Would you please kill about <cf>10 horngoats on the Hill of God's Watchful Eye?
Once the Horngoths have been driven out, <cf>everyone will be able to relax and celebrate!
We don't want them to become "You, the Spring Caller" either. <cf>Thanks for your help, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Would you please go and take down 10 Horngoats from "God's Watch Hill"?
<cf>I understand your fascination with the beauty of the "welcoming flowers of spring. <cf> But it's not good to harm people, is it?
I just want you to punish them a little and get rid of them! <cf>Thank you for your help, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thanks, adventurer! <cf>The Horngoat's damage is gone!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>The people of the town and my husband are relieved~!
<cf>We've gathered enough flowers to welcome spring, and it looks like we'll be able to spend our time without any problems!
Hahaha!　It looks like <cf>Mr. King Collector</cf> will be able to become the long-sought-after "Spring Caller"!
Hmmm...but it was the adventurers who collected the most <cf>hunka</cf>, wasn't it?
I think it would be <cf>good</cf> if the adventurer became the "Spring Calling You" too!
I see, for Varen, you <cf>have a point!
The "Spring Caller" is the one who calls for a new spring. <cf> He who gathers flowers and shares his bounty with the people.
<cf>The master is indeed a gatherer, but it is the adventurer who has shared his bounty with the people.
You are the wonderful "You, the Spring Caller". <cf>Thank you again. Thank you.
Hahaha!　I wouldn't mind <cf>having as many of you as you like, congratulations, "You, the Spring Caller"!
I hope you will enjoy this season by collecting more and more "spring flowers!
We still have more gorgeous prizes available. <cf>Please do not hesitate to redeem them!
Please continue to collect "Welcome [Spring][Flower]" and bring them here<cf>!
The festive season is still going on! <cf>We are still looking for "Welcome Flowers for Spring"!
Let's celebrate the <cf>new spring</cf> by exchanging them for gorgeous prizes!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you heard of "Fairy Lentil Nectar"?
Let's give <cf>honey and sweet treats as a token of our appreciation to those who have helped us!
It's the beginning of a wonderful festive period! <cf>Adventurers, enjoy to your heart's content, hahaha!
This time, my master has set his sights on the "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
It is the nectar of a flower that opens at will like a fairy. <cf> It is sweet, fragrant, and has a heavenly taste.
<cf>It is also called "fantastic nectar," and can only be enjoyed at this time of year!
Hahaha!　Since it's a mirage, there's no way "King Collector" wouldn't be <cf>interested in it, right?
I've decided to give out sweet treats <cf> made with this honey</cf> to everyone in town!
However, the fairy lentil flowers have spikes<cf>that get caught on the monsters' bodies!
Rumblebores, in particular, are large and <cf>often carry off the flowers!
Moreover, they love "nectar of the fairy lilies,"<cf>and if left unchecked, will eat more and more of them!
That's why you have to defeat the Rumblebores in order to get your hands on the Fairy Lentil Nectar!
Would you please go <cf>defeat about 5 Rumblebores in the Minster Hills?
We need the "nectar of the fairy lentil" for everyone! <cf>Please do, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Could you please go and take down five Rumblebores in the "Minster Hills" <cf>?
I'm sure there's a lot of fairy lilies stuck <cf> in those big bodies!
They also seem to eat the "nectar of fairy lilies,"<cf> so let's get rid of them while we can!　I asked!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf> You got rid of the rumblebores!
Just as I thought, I found a lot of <cf>fairy lentil flowers caught in the rumblebore's body hair!
I thank you from the bottom of my heart, adventurer! I also got <cf>'fairy lentil nectar'!
Now, let's <cf>start making sweets<cf> right away!
Hahaha!　Actually, it's the season for giving sweets to those who have taken care of us as a token of <cf>gratitude</cf>.
The "King Collector" also wanted to <cf>give sweets</cf> to everyone in town!
<cf>Special sweets only available at this time of the year, made with a generous amount of rare "fairy lotus root nectar"!
We have been indebted to everyone at Asterlys for their support in our daily collection activities!
In my own way, <cf>my husband is doing his utmost to show his gratitude!
Well, I can't deny my <cf> somewhat personal desire to taste the "nectar of fairy lilies"!
Hahaha!　That's why I want you adventurers to deliver <cf>"nectar of the fairy lily" in abundance!
I've got some great prizes in store for you adventurers! <cf>Come on in and trade in your "Fairy Lentil Nectar" for a lot of "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>How's your "Fairy Lentil Nectar" collecting going?
<cf>All sorts of monsters should be dropping them, so the more you defeat them, the more you'll get!
Let's collect as many as we can and trade them in for some great prizes! <cf>Enjoy the festival, adventurers, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>How's your "Fairy Lentil Nectar" collecting going?
Our baking is going well! <cf>The sweet smell is filling the streets!
<cf>The rich flavor of "nectar of the fairy lotus" goes well with all kinds of sweets!
Cookies, candies, macaroons, doughnuts. <cf>They are all well received by everyone!
Hahaha!　Baking, kneading, and stirring! <cf>I'm very busy, but I enjoy baking too!
But, according to the "King Collector," <cf>[something is missing ......["]]
[I'd like to try to be the only one! [I want to be one-of-a-kind!
[I want something playful, yet not too assertive, something that will tickle the collector's fancy.
I left it at the house for the time being.
When I was worried about it, everyone in town told me <cf>interesting stories.
<cf>In that case, I heard that you can make <cf>interesting sweets by using "Tenshoku Dandelion"!
It's a material that produces beautiful colors, but <cf>you don't know what color it's going to be until it's finished!
If you think of it as a kind of lottery to choose a color, <cf>or perhaps it's just as festive as it sounds!
<cf>I think this kind of trick could accomplish the "King Collector's" request!
Hahaha!　Could you please go to the Minster Hills and collect 10 <cf>"tumbled-colored dandelions"?
In the meantime, we'll continue making sweets! <cf>We'll finish them up as soon as the adventurers return!
<cf>Please go to the Minster Hills and collect 10 "Dandelions"!
If you combine them with the "Fairy Lentil Nectar" sweets, <cf>you should be able to create a one-of-a-kind, wonderful coloring!
I'll be waiting for you while I continue to make the sweets! <cf>Oh, I'll have to check the oven!　Hahah!
Hahaha!　Thanks, adventurer! <cf>That's a beautiful "tumbled dandelion"!
The colors are colorful and brilliant! <cf>Thank you, Mr. Adventurer!　Thank you very much!
<cf>Yes, it's just as colorful as the candy! <cf>Yes, just like a flower garden of sweets!
<span size="Big">A field of sweets!　Sounds lovely! </>
<cf>I can feel my heart beating out of my chest like when I look at myself in the mirror!
I hope you don't mind if I tear it up~!
Hahaha!　<cf>I can't even stop myself from having this crush!
Come on, adventurer!　Sorry to keep you waiting! <cf>It's time for "Fairy Lentil Nectar" and "Rolling Color Dandelion"!
<cf>I'm sure there will be a colorful flower garden of sweets all over the city!
<cf>My flower garden partner sometimes has nice things to say. <cf>I'm sure you'll all be pleased!
Adventurers, please continue to collect <cf>"Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
We will still be making more sweets, and <cf>we still have some great prizes to give away!
<cf>You don't have to worry about how much "nectar of the fairy lily" you have! <cf>The more we have, the more everyone will smile!
<cf>Gather as many as you can and deliver them to us! <cf>We'll be waiting for as much as we can get, hahaha!
Hahaha!　<cf>The "Fairy Lentil Nectar" sweets have been a big hit!
Everyone seems to be enjoying <cf>the colorful colors as well as the sweet flavor!
<cf>Thanks to all the adventurers! <cf>We're still waiting for more "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
The more you collect, the more prizes you can exchange for! <cf>Have fun, adventurers!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Thanks for all the "nectar of the fairy lentils"!
Thanks to you, our snacks are a big hit! <cf>Everyone is so happy, they're thanking us for it!
<cf>"Fairy Lentil Nectar" is sweet and tasty, and <cf>the color changing of the dandelions is fun!
<cf>The things that adventurers have collected have brought smiles to everyone's faces!
My husband, the "King Collector," would like to <cf>thank you very much!
Since we've gone to all this trouble, we've decided to enjoy making sweets together with the people of the town.
Since we'll need a lot of ingredients, I went to <cf>Larpal's farm</cf> to ask for some.
Then I heard a troubling story!
They said that Kaiser Elk were destroying the farm and <cf>damaging the crops and dairy cows!
We, too, have been <cf>gratefully indebted to them for many of the ingredients for our pastries!
How can we express our gratitude <cf>if we do not help the farmers here?
Hahaha!　I'm on fire and so is Carnera! <cf>We need your help, adventurers!
<cf>Could you help us take down seven Kaiser Elk from the Hill of God's Watchful Eye?
In the meantime, we'll build a fence and make sure they can't get near the plantation!
Even if we can't fight the monsters, <cf>we will do what we can to help!
For the sake of everyone on the plantation, <cf>please help us defeat the Kaiser Elk!
We need to keep the Kaiser Elk from getting <cf>close to us</cf>, as they are destroying the plantation!
<cf>We are also indebted to you for the ingredients for the sweets!
Go to <cf>God's Watch Hill</cf> and kill 7 Kaiser Elk!
<cf>In the meantime, we'll do our best to build a fence! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf> We got rid of the Kaiser Elk without incident!
Thank you for your cooperation, adventurer! <cf>Thanks to you, peace has been restored to the plantation!
We have taken countermeasures, so we <cf>should</cf> no longer be plagued by monsters!
We've received lots of ingredients for sweets again, too! <cf>We should make more and more to show our gratitude!
But, Carnera. Did we really <cf>get everyone's thanks?
Oh, Varen. What a coincidence. <cf>I feel like I'm forgetting someone important, too!
Hahaha!　I knew Carnera would understand! <cf>The one to whom we should definitely deliver our special treats!
<span size="Big">It's the adventurer! </>
We are indebted to many people, but <cf>adventurers are the best!
When it comes to expressing our gratitude, <cf>we can't leave out the adventurers!
Hahaha!　That's why <cf>we all made a special decorated cake for the adventurers!
<cf>We filled it with "fairy lotus nectar" and "tumbled dandelion"! <cf>We made it sweet and colorful!
<cf>We put our heartfelt thanks into it! <cf>Please accept it!　Hahaha!
<cf>We are able to enjoy making sweets like this <cf>thanks to our adventurers!
Of course, please <cf>collect as many more "fairy lotus nectar" as you can and bring them with you!
We will continue to exchange them for gorgeous prizes~!
Hahaha!　The festival is still going on, you know! <cf>We hope it will be a wonderful memory for adventurers!
<cf>The "Nectar of the Fairy Lentils", the special sweets, and the prizes are only for this special time of the year!
Collect your "Fairy Lentil Nectar" and <cf>have a happy time!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　<cf>We're still looking for "Fairy Lentil Nectar"!
Various monsters seem to have it. <cf>We want you to defeat more and more monsters and collect as many as you can!
Gorgeous prizes await adventurers! <cf>Make some sweet and wonderful memories, haha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you heard of "The Old Paper of Maigrat"?
Asterlys is in full swing with the opening of the port festival! <cf>We can't lose, can we?
<cf>We'll provide a fun event for everyone! <cf>Please help us to do so!　Hahaha!
This time, my husband has his eyes on "Maigurat's Old Paper"!
It was mass-produced hundreds of years ago, and has a very old-fashioned coloring.
<cf>It will be perfect for drawing a treasure map, etc.<cf>!
Yes, that's right!　It would be fun to do a treasure hunt with a map made of <cf>Maigurat's Old Paper</cf>!
<cf>Asterlys is in the midst of the Port Opening Festival! <cf>My husband wanted to do something to add to the festivities.
<cf>We have a warehouse full of goods, so why don't we take this opportunity to give them away to the people of the city?
Hahaha!　Carnera's idea was to have a treasure hunt <cf>with everyone</cf>!
If we're going to do it, we want to be particular about the treasure map! <cf>"Maigurat's Old Paper" is perfect for this!
<cf>The old paper from Maigurat was perfect for the job!　<cf>The old Maigurat paper got scattered all over the place during the transportation.
The carton broke and the paper flew away in the strong wind!
We have to go around collecting them, but <cf>before we do that, we have to take measures to prevent them from scattering<cf> again!
Hahaha!　So I want the adventurers to find <cf>"dead heavy stones"!
It's a stone known for its weight and size! <cf>It's perfect if you use it as a dead weight stone!
<cf>I think five of them would be enough to hold <cf>Maigurat's Old Paper</cf> firmly in place!
<cf>If you collect them in the "Sea Rhythm Meadow", you should be able to find them. <cf>"Dead Heavy Stone" please, haha!
<cf>I want you to go to the Sea Rhythm Meadow and collect five Dead Heavy Stones!
With that, I'll be able to <cf>search for "Mygrat Old Paper"!
Hahaha! <cf>Adventurer, I'm counting on you!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>This is the "Dead Heavy Stone", right?
Hahaha......<span size="Big">It's really heavy! </>
It's a heavy stone, isn't it? <cf>Thank you, adventurer.
However, if we don't collect the important "old paper of Maigurat,"<cf>there will be no place to put the stone.
So, <cf>Vaaren will keep it with him until the "Maigurat's Old Paper" is collected.
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>I want you to collect "Maigurat's Old Paper" as soon as possible!
<cf>I can't wait until my arms are at their limits! <cf>They're already getting pretty stiff!
If your arms don't work, put them on your knees. <cf>If you sit on your knees, you'll be more stable.
Oh, here <cf>is a jagged board that looks comfortable to sit on!
Hahaha!　I think I'll try a little harder! <cf>My arm muscles are suddenly full of motivation!
So, adventurer. <cf>Please collect "Maigurat's Old Paper" at your own pace!
According to eyewitnesses, it seems that <cf>monsters are picking up the scattered "old Maigurat papers"!
Some of them use the paper, others eat it. <cf> Either way, it's going to be unusable.
It's not very strong paper to begin with. <cf>It will tear and fall apart after the time of the opening festival.
This is the only time of year to enjoy it, including the treasure hunt! <cf>Please collect as many as you can and exchange them for gorgeous prizes~!
Hahaha!　Adventurers get their <cf> treasures ahead of the rest!
<cf>Collect more and more "Maigurat's Old Paper" and take the <cf>precious prizes with you!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Hey there, adventurer! <cf>The old Maigurat papers are coming in nicely!
<cf>I'm relieved to have a place to lay my weights! <cf> Holding on to it wasn't so bad, though!
How do you like it?　My beautiful muscles are even more polished now! <cf>Now, adventurers, take a closer look!
<cf>I'm not looking at anything when I deliver the "Dead Heavy Stone" to your brain, am I?　Adventurer.
I would appreciate it if you would close your eyes <cf>when I pay you an additional visit!
Hahaha!　But there's something about "Maigurat's Old Paper" that I <cf>cannot</cf> turn a blind eye to!
The "Happy Happy Uribo"!　<cf>They've got a happy name, and they're in trouble!
In fact, the "Happi-Happi-Uribo" monster likes to eat <cf>"Maigurat's Old Paper"!
They eat so much that they even affect their [living organism] engrams, and <cf>they have even changed their appearance from normal Uribo!
If they are eaten at such a rate, it may even interfere with the "King Collector's" treasure hunting event.
If they eat up all the "Maigurat's Old Paper," <cf>our plan to make the Port Opening Festival more exciting will be ruined!
Before that happens, we need you to defeat the "Happihappiuribo" and <cf>get rid of them!
If we take down 10 of them, <cf>they'll go quiet for a while!
Please <cf>defeat</cf> 10 "Happi-Happi Uribo" in "Minster [Hillside]"!
Of course, you can use the "old paper of Maigurat" you get as <cf>adventurer's achievement!
I want you to <cf>defeat 10 Happihappiuribo in <cf>Minster [Hillside]</cf>.
They seem to be very fond of "Maigurat's Old Paper. <cf>If we leave them alone, they'll eat more and more of them.
We don't want them to get in the way of our adventurers! <cf>I want to get rid of them while I can, haha!
Hahaha!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf> I guess we're done defeating "Happi Happi Uribo"!
Nice work as always, adventurer! <cf>My thanks to you as well!
<cf>With this, the damage caused by the eating of "Maigurat's Old Paper" will be <cf>controlled!
Anyway, I wonder why "Happi-Happi-Uribo" wants to eat <cf>"Maigurat's Old Paper"?
Is it delicious? <cf> Do they enjoy the dazzling ancient taste?
Hahaha!　I'm getting kind of curious! <cf>Maybe I should try to become a "Happi Happi Varen" too!
Even if you don't eat, you'll still be <cf> happy-go-lucky</cf> every day!
Really?　I'm kind of embarrassed, hahaha!
Maigurat's Old Paper is said to be a daily commodity that was manufactured in large quantities in the old capital of Maigurat.
Although it is a relic of a bygone era, it is not a rare or precious item.
They are piled up in the warehouse of the "King Collector" and used for <cf>treasure hunting events!
It's the kind of paper that everyone in the ancient city of Maigurat used to use as a matter of course.
In other words, there is still a lot of old paper for adventurers to collect!
It seems to be scattered all over the place, and there <cf>seems to be some examples taken away by monsters. We must continue to collect them!
Please help us, adventurers! <cf>We also continue to offer great prizes!
<cf>We are looking for "My Grat's Old Paper"! <cf>Adventurers, please aim to get the treasure, too, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you very much for collecting "Maigurat's Old Paper"!
It seems that <cf>"Happi Happi Uribo" sometimes has a lot of "Maigurat's Old Paper"<cf>!
We don't want them to be eaten, so if you see them, please take them down! <cf> Bring me more and more!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Are you enjoying the opening festivities in Asterlys?
I hope you're collecting "Maigrat's Old Paper," too, but <cf>don't let the festival pass you by!
<cf>There are a lot of people here, and it's very lively! <cf>I think the arena will be a lot of fun, too!
Yes, the arena!　<cf>The arena is a beautiful, blood-boiling garden of battle! <cf>The arena is surely waiting for adventurers!
Why don't you stop with the lame advertising and <cf>ask us frankly?
The prize in the arena is "Maigurat's old paper,"<cf>so why don't you take up the challenge and collect it?　Hahaha!
You should have said so from the beginning. <cf> Excuse me, Mr. Adventurer.
Actually, it seems that "Maigurat's Old Paper" was <cf>[mixed up] in the prizes of the arena!
Asterlys is in the midst of the Port Opening Festival! <cf>The delivery people are also in a great hurry.
It seems that by mistake, the "Maigrat's Old Paper" has arrived at the arena!
Even when we tried to sort it out, the arena was <cf>crowded with festivities</cf> in the arena.
I don't think there's any other <cf>way to do this but to get the prize fair and square!
If you let your partner do it, you will only get back <cf>rags instead of used paper!
Everyone is having fun at the Port Opening Festival, but <cf>I don't think it's a good idea to go to the trouble of adding to the burnable trash!
Hahaha!　No, Carnera! <cf>"Maigurat's old paper" is not garbage!
That's why I want adventurers to collect <cf>"Maigurat's Old Paper" in the arena!
You'll get your <cf>prize</cf> by clearing the "Rush Battle - First Stage"!
<cf>I'm sure you'll be fine! <cf>I'm cheering for you from here, hahaha!
I want you to clear "Rush Battle - First Stage" <cf>and get the prize in the arena!
<cf>It seems that "Mygrat's Old Paper" got mixed up in the arena. <cf>Only the winner can retrieve it.
<cf>I'm sure you'll be fine, adventurer! <cf>We're rooting for you, so do your best!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Good job, adventurer! <cf>You won the "Rush Battle"!
We were able to collect the "Mygrat's Old Paper" and <cf>the people in the arena thanked us for it!
I was only <cf>troubled</cf> if someone else got this as a prize!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>"Maigurat's Old Papers" have been collected for quite some time now.
<cf>Master King Collector is getting ready to start preparing for the treasure hunt<cf>.
We, too, are thinking of starting to make a treasure map.
Hahaha!　It would be great if the Port Opening Festival were more <cf>exciting!
It's thanks to the adventurers who <cf>collect</cf> "Maigurat's old paper"!　Hahaha!
By the way, I heard that there is a legend about "Maigurat's Old Paper" <cf> that is related to the port!
At the time of the ship's departure, the colorful pieces of paper were <cf>sprinkled out to sea!
<cf>to see off the sailors and pray for safety on the voyage. <cf>It was a custom with such a meaning.
Hahaha!　Nice! <cf>This is perfect for the opening ceremony of the Asterlys!
After the treasure hunt is over, let's all try to imitate it!
<cf>We'll see some beautiful confetti! <cf> Confetti as beautiful as mine!
Did you say you want to disappear like confetti into the sea?
Hahaha!　The ocean belongs to all of us! <cf>We must try not to pollute it!
Come on, the port opening festivities are still going on! <cf>I also want you to collect more "Maigurat's old papers"!
We have a great selection of prizes! <cf>Adventurers only!
Please continue to bring your "Maigurat's Old Paper"! <cf>Please enjoy the exchange until the very end~!
Hahaha!　<cf>The collection of "Maigurat's old paper" will continue until the end of the Port Opening Festival!
Don't miss out on the gorgeous prizes in return! <cf>It doesn't matter if you exchange them all!
Enjoy the Port Opening Festival till the end!　Hahaha!
Hey there, adventurers! <cf>Have you heard of "gold dust sap"?
It's a culture that all the boys get into at one time or another! <cf>It's insect collecting!
<cf>I'd like to use "gold dust sap" to make it more exciting! <cf>I'd like your help if you want!　Hahaha!
My husband has his eye on the "gold dust sap" this time.
<cf>Insect collecting is currently a boom among the children of Asterlys.
The biggest of them all are after the biggest of them all! <cf>The favorite food of the King of the Golden Helmet is gold dust sap!
Inspired by this story, the "King Collector" began to make a fuss to get his hands on the "King of Gold Helmet" at all costs.
The first thing they did was to collect "gold dust sap!
Actually, I've asked the children to collect the "gold dust sap" while collecting insects.
They all wanted to see the "King of the Golden Helmet". <cf>It was a joint operation with the "King Collector!
<cf>But the "gold dust sap" is something that animals like too. <cf>Monsters may come nearby!
We cannot put the children in danger. <cf>Could we ask for the help of adventurers?
Hahaha!　First of all, I want you to defeat <cf>Uribo</cf> of "Minster [Hills]" and get rid of him!
Then the children will be able to collect <cf>'gold dust sap' safely!
I'm counting on you, adventurer!　The road to the "King of the Golden Helmet" <cf>rests on your shoulders!　Hahaha!
I want you to <cf>defeat and get rid of five "Uribo" in "Minster [Hillside]"!
It would be a disaster if the children run into any <cf>monsters while collecting insects or collecting gold dust sap!
<cf>Let everyone know that they are safe with the adventurers watching over them!　I'm counting on you, hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thanks for your hard work in defeating Uribo!
<cf>Thank you!　And congratulations! <cf>Now you're one of the agents who protect the world!
What are you talking about?　What are you talking about?　Hahaha! <cf>Then let me explain it to you from the beginning!
[<cf>There's actually a group of people who are hiding behind the insect collecting craze.
Their name is "Insect Force"! <cf>They are an evil organization that manipulates insects and plans to take over the world!
<cf>We must stop their ambitions and protect the world! <cf>Their trump card is the King of Helmet!
In order to revive the King of the Golden Helmet, we need "gold dust sap"! <cf>It is the agent's mission to collect it!
Now, I'm asking you!　Defeat the "Insector Force" and <cf>you too must protect the world together!　Hahaha!
[The idea is to let the children have fun collecting <cf>gold dust sap</cf>!
Hahaha!　What do you think? <cf>I was up all night thinking about it!　Isn't it a hot story?
Surprisingly, there are a lot of people who are into it! <cf>Boys like this kind of thing, after all!
<cf>Of course, girls are welcome too! <cf>Because it's best for everyone to have fun together, hahaha!
Whatever you do, please bring your "gold dust sap"! <cf>We have many gorgeous prizes!
Only at this time of the year, you can enjoy the fun! <cf>Please enjoy collecting "gold dust sap"!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>The "Golden Sap" is gathering more and more!
<cf>The story of "Insector Force" seems to be well received. <cf>Everyone is collecting a lot of it!
Hahaha!　<cf>It feels good to know that everyone is into my stories!
What evil organization are you talking about?
If we were an evil organization, that would make the King Collector the head of evil, wouldn't it?
I see, that makes sense. <cf> For once, Varen has got one over on me.
Hahaha!　<cf>The fever of such a "King Collector" is still not cooled down yet!
More and more "gold dust sap"! <cf>More and more for the "King of the Golden Helmet"!
<cf>If greed is evil, then our master is the very embodiment of that evil. <cf>His greed and desire to collect knows no bounds!
<cf>So, I thought I'd expand the scope of the "Golden Sap" collection a little bit.
<cf>I checked out the Andorra Basin, <cf>but I'm in a bit of a pickle.
The rumblebores eat the golden sap! <cf>It would be a problem if people who went to collect it met up with them!
Adventurers, could you please take down <cf>10 or so</cf> rumblebores in the "Andorra Basin"?
If we get rid of them now, <cf>we can deal with them later!
For the safety of the "Golden Sap" collection, <cf>we ask for the help of adventurers!
Can you <cf>kill 10 Rumblebores</cf> in the "Andorra Basin" and get rid of them?
They know the taste of "golden sap" and are gathering. <cf>We want to keep them away from us while we can.
It would be a disaster if everyone met up with them. <cf>Thanks for your help, adventurer!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for defeating Rumblebore!
This will make it easier to find <cf>"gold dust sap" in the "Andorra Basin!
Oh, and of course, the kids are with the adults. <cf>That's been well communicated!
Everyone has been looking for <cf>"gold dust sap" in various places, and we have been collecting it well!
I hear things have been good for insect collecting, too.
Hahaha!　That's right! <cf>There was a boy who caught a rare insect from the "Andorra Basin!
<cf>She became very popular and made a lot of friends! <cf>This is another good thing about insect collecting!
<cf>Of course, it was only because of the adventurer's efforts that he was able to catch the insects!
<cf>It is a pleasure to see the circle of people expanding through the collection of gold dust sap and insects!
My husband's greed may be useful from time to time!
Now, now, please satisfy my husband's unfathomable greed with <cf>"golden sap" to the fullest!
There are still more gorgeous prizes to be won! <cf>Please collect as much as you can and exchange it as often as you like!
Hahaha!　Adventurers! <cf>This is great news to shake up the insect collecting boom!
We may <cf> finally be able to catch the "King of Golden Helmets"!
The golden-helmeted insect that all of you insect collectors have been searching for!
As I have already mentioned, our master "King Collector" also <cf>wants</cf> it!
We have been diligently coating the trees with large amounts of "gold dust sap" and waiting for the "King of Gold Helmet" to appear.
And then, <cf>"The King of Golden Helmet" appeared...!　The bark of the trees where I had applied the "gold dust sap" had been completely eaten away!
No ordinary insect could do such a thing! <cf>The King of the Golden Helmet must have come here!
So we made a new one with the same trick, <cf>but another problem arose!
This time it's Meen who's in the way! <cf>The same insect is a dangerous monster, Aitsurasa!
<cf>Meons have been snatching up and eating the "gold dust sap" that we've gone to the trouble of applying, one after another!
<cf>The King of the Golden Helmet won't come! <cf>We have to get rid of Meen!
<cf>The meons on the Litze Trading Road are devouring the gold dust sap that we have set up!
There are so many of them that we have no time to deal with them. <cf>Could you please take down 20 of them?
We are only one step away from the "King of the Golden Helmet"! <cf>Everyone wants to see the king of the phantom insects!
Please do us all a favor, adventurer! <cf>Grant everyone's wish by getting rid of Meen!
I want you to kill <cf>20</cf> meons on the Ritze Trading Road!
If they devour any more of the "gold dust sap,"<cf>I won't be able to stand it!
<cf>To catch the "King of the Golden Helmet" with my own hands! <cf>I've entrusted everyone's dreams to you, adventurer!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Thank you for defeating Meen! <cf> Thanks to you, adventurer, I was able to fix the trap!
From now on, the King of the Golden Helmet will come to <cf>eat</cf> the gold dust sap!
If we can catch him there, our dream will come true!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>My master thanks you as well.
<cf>We are one step closer to becoming the King of the Golden Helmet. <cf>It seems that everyone is looking forward to it!
<cf>This is going to be the climax of the insect collecting boom! <cf>I'll have to keep an eye on it!
<cf>We are still waiting for the "gold dust sap". <cf>Please feel free to exchange it for some great prizes!
My husband. Once he catches one "King of the Golden Helmet", I'm sure he'll say, <cf>[I want a mate...]!
Hahaha!　That's right! <cf>"King Collector" will never be satisfied with just one!
He's going to need more of the "gold dust sap"!
Our insect collecting never ends! <cf> Come on, adventurers, let's have some fun together!　Hahaha!
Hahaha!　Adventurer! <cf>Do you still have some gold dust sap on hand?
Don't forget to exchange it for some gorgeous prizes! <cf>You can bring me more and more!
Let's enjoy the insect collecting boom to the end! <cf>"Gold dust sap", I'll be waiting for you!　Hahaha!
Oh no, it's a busy place! <cf>Asterleaze's opening ceremony, indeed!
It's the biggest festival in Asterleaze. <cf>It can't be outdone even by the Buffalian Star Festival!
<cf>The area around the port is decorated, and <cf>there are many people here. There are stalls.
How are you enjoying yourself, my friend?
Yes, yes, it is important to take a break.
But you are adventurers, too, and you can't just play around.
You remember what we're here for, don't you? <cf>I told you in the beginning.
The first thing we must obtain. <cf>The first thing we have to get is...
<span size="Big">Gold! </>
Where there are people, there will be information. <cf>It's also important to get the word out, isn't it?
From the looks of it, you still don't know. <cf>I have no choice, I will tell you a "good story".
<cf>Between you and me, I'll tell you a good story.　<cf>I have heard that there is a treasure in the Lake Tunnel that no one has ever seen before!
<cf>Would anyone believe that there is a treasure so close by? <cf>That's why it's a pit!
<cf>This, this, this, don't show your face. <cf>Don't let anyone beat you to it.
<cf>Only by outwitting the competition will you be able to enjoy the thrill of getting the treasure!　Hmmm...
(Perhaps that's how they did it with the "Cliff Ruins." ......)
Now, there's no time to dilly-dally. <cf>Let's head out to the "Lake Tunnel" right away!
Sometimes it's good for me and you to go and earn money together. <cf>Wait for me, treasure yet unseen!
Let's go to the "Lake Tunnel," my servant! <cf>There are rumors of a treasure yet to be discovered.
<cf> To be the first to hear of such rumors is the secret of a successful man.
<cf>You are not ready for this. <cf> You can learn a thing or two from me!
<cf> We've arrived. <cf> I don't see anyone else here looking for treasure.
Good, good. We're the first to arrive!
<cf> But it's a strange feeling, isn't it? <cf>It's been a long time since I've been here, but it doesn't seem that long.
<cf>I remember when we had to fight an ogre out of the blue!
<cf> You should be able to handle it with ease. <cf>I'll follow along comfortably.
Don't worry, I won't skip a beat. <cf>I wouldn't want to miss the treasure!
<cf>Let's go, down to the treasure we haven't seen yet! <cf>Let's go, servant!
Well, thank you!　<cf>With you and me, the Lake Tunnel will be a piece of cake!
Now for the important treasure: ......!
The usual "Lake Crystal": ......
What a treasure I've never seen before! <cf>That's a load of rubbish, isn't it?
I thought it was funny!　<cf>Someone has already explored the "Lake Lid Tunnel"!
If there's treasure there, <cf>I'll go get it myself before I tell anyone else!
It would be a waste of time! <cf>Ah, I'm so angry!　I'm so angry!
......?　Not a waste of time? <cf>Well, I may have overstepped the mark: ......
<cf>Well, maybe I overstepped the mark. [<cf>You're not going to say something like "[having] adventures with me was the most treasured experience of my life" or something like that, are you?
<span size="Big">What? </> What are you doing all of a sudden?
<span size="Big">What are you doing all of a sudden? <cf>Yes, that's exactly what I'm talking about!
<span size="Big">What are you doing? <cf>Servant!　I'm going to conquer the stalls, so go along with me!
Well, well, it's <cf>my first time</cf> walking with someone at the Port Opening Festival, and I'm having fun too. ......
I'll just go! <cf>You can't make money if you're hungry!
You'll be earning a lot of money tomorrow.
After all, you are <cf>my</cf> best servant!
How are you enjoying the Port Opening Festival?
<cf>If you hear of any lucrative opportunities, <cf>tell me immediately!　Okay?
<span size="Big">Master and his Lord!　Scold me! </>
<span size="Big">Master and his Lord! <cf>We have no taste for scolding for no reason!
It's the opening ceremony of the port festival and ......<cf>I'm chewing on my own unworthiness......!
It is a knight's name broken to accept charity from those he is supposed to protect! <cf>How pathetic a man am I?
You're exaggerating. I didn't just <cf>buy you a skewer from a street vendor!
Oh, Charlotte. <cf> I see you're here too.
Of course!　I always look forward to the Port Opening Festival. <cf>It's the biggest event in Asterlys.
<cf>We can see the stage, eat, and walk around. <cf>During the Port Opening Festival, I can forget about all the bad things.
So why don't you take it easy and enjoy yourself, Carveen?
Charlotte is right. <cf>I don't think it's a good idea to be so uptight all the time.
If I can get a treat, <cf> I'll conquer all the stalls right now!
I would not hesitate to treat the Master and his Lord. <cf>But ......
I don't even have a wallet now, it's a dream I can't fulfill. ......
Purse?　I thought you said you lost it. <cf>I think it was when we met in "The Soundless City.
[I'm sorry, you didn't go looking for it yet!
I was so busy after that that I forgot about it. ......
So how have you been spending your time so far?
I was funded by Einlein!
<span size="Big">That's what you should be scolding me for! </>
But it's a good opportunity. <cf> I think we should go to the "Soundless City" to look for the wallet here!
Master, would you mind accompanying me? <cf>It's been a long time since I've fought side by side with a master.
Ah, then I want to go too!
Eh?　No, no, no, we're going to the ruins. <cf>This isn't like a festival.
It's so boring to just wait around. <cf>Then I want to go on an adventure with everyone!
If you say no,<cf>......<cf>you can pay me back for the skewers right here, right now!
Ugh!　Well, now that you mention it: ......
Why don't you take him with you? <cf>You're with me, and your servant is with me, so I'm sure we'll be fine.
It's more trouble than it's worth if they sneak up on you later. <cf> Charlotte would probably do something like that.
<cf>I understand, I'll go with you. <cf>I'm just looking for my wallet, so don't do anything rash.
I'll protect you even if it costs me my life!
Isn't it unfair to say that right away? ......
Let's go to "The Soundless City"! <cf>This is a disgraceful story, but I have to find my dropped wallet.
It would be great if you could come too, Master. <cf>It's been a while since we've been able to fight together, and I'm kind of looking forward to it!
I won't slow you down either, so please do me a favor.
I'll show you that I haven't lost my skill with the bow!
<cf> I'm looking forward to fighting with you in a long time! I miss it a little.
I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't met the masters here.
I might have been killed by Avaritia just like that. <cf> After all, the masters saved my life!
That was before I met him, right? <cf> Then you went to the desert and saved me, too.
Yes, yes. <cf>I was swept away by a reckless diva who took the bait herself!
Haha ...... thanks for that. <cf>But I'm not just protected anymore.
I can fight too, so watch me!
I'll protect Charlotte. <cf>Don't worry about your master.
Come on, let's go!　Go find my purse!
<span size="Big">I couldn't find it ......! </>
Well, that was a long time ago. <cf>Maybe someone picked it up.
Or it could be in the belly of a monster. <cf>There's no way to know for sure.
[<cf>This is a heavy lesson: don't lose your wallet, and look for it immediately. <cf> I hope what's inside was a learning experience.
I am sorry, Charlotte. In the name of my knighthood, <cf>I will repay you for your hospitality!
I don't mind. I had a great time adventuring with Carvain and the others.
It was kind of festive over here.
But that doesn't make me feel any better!
Really?　If you insist that much,<cf>I'll let you hang out with me a little longer.
There's an interesting event going on at the harbor stage. <cf>It looks like street performers and divas will be there.
I'd love to go, but I'm afraid I'll be alone.
<cf>I'd be happy to do that for a small fee! <cf>I'll go out with you as much as you want if it's okay with me!
Thanks a lot.
Well then, will you escort me?　Knight.
Yes, I will!
Well then, Master and his Lord. <cf> Thank you very much!
Please let me fight with you again sometime. <cf>I had fun today too!
You two have fun at the Port Opening Festival! <cf>See you then!
By the way, the opening port festival in Asterlys is <cf>really lively!
Shall we buy something for Einlein, too? <cf>...... No, I didn't have my wallet. ......
I'm so glad <cf>I never thought I'd get to go around the Port Opening Festival with Carvain!
I hope you guys enjoy the Port Opening Festival too. <cf>A festival should be a party, after all!
Let's see... ......
That ...... festival, right?
Oh, no, that's not it. Well, let's have some food ....... <cf> Or maybe a nap ......
............?
What are you ...... doing, since a moment ago?
Oh, you two. We met you in a good place.
I saw Mr. Einlein earlier and <cf>call out to him!
He seemed to have something to say, but <cf>I couldn't quite put my finger on it:</cf>......
So you were <cf>talking about this and that.
Hmm?　You mean me?
We need a little ...... help. <cf>The equipment of the <cf>Sacred Temple of Heavenly Blessings</cf> is not working. ......
<cf>Well, isn't that a big deal! <cf>I will go there at once!
Wait, wait!　Don't run off on your own!
If you need our help, then <cf>you must be in a lot of trouble, right?
There are still monsters in the area to be repaired. <cf>The congregation can't handle it and ...... is in trouble.
That's why I've been waiting for ...... you guys to come.
Then why don't you just come and call us?
Oh, perhaps I should have <cf>called you two?
I would not have let God's hands get in the way of ......
Please don't worry about that.
In times of distress and trouble, people join hands with each other. <cf> I have no need to hold back.
Just as well, Einlein. <cf> Let's go with Erinse to the "Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings.
<cf>Ayerinse is the only one who can fix the device anyway. <cf> Then you may as well come with us.
<cf>After all, you and I have been on many adventures together, so perhaps we can be a little less reserved.
......!　God and adventure ......!
It's settled. All right, my servant! <cf> Let us bring them together!
<cf>The equipment of the Cathedral of Heavenly Blessings seems to be malfunctioning. <cf> I think I can fix it, so let's go!
<cf>I'm enjoying the thought of going out with you all, even if it's in a slightly unusual way.
With God ...... adventures ......!
From what I can see here, there doesn't seem to be anything major wrong.
But we'll need to go <cf>deeper</cf> to find out more and deal with it!
I don't think it will be <cf>as much of a mess as it was when we first came here......
The monster hasn't been as rampant as it was then.
But ...... they haven't gone completely quiet.
I think the avaritia shell has made the <cf>"Cathedral of [Heavenly Blessing]" itself unstable.
Well, there's no use in taking things too seriously. <cf>This time there is not much trouble, is there?
Leave the surroundings to the servants, and you <cf>watch out for Einlein</cf>.
<cf>I understand. I look forward to working with you.
Thank you for your hard work. <cf>The device was successfully repaired.
It was an easy job, but I feel ......<cf>somewhat a little disappointed.
<cf>It is unusual for you to say such a thing. <cf>I would think you would be glad that nothing happened.
I'm sorry if I sounded inappropriate. <cf>I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that every time I move forward with Einlein and everyone else, <cf>I feel a little more uplifted. ......
I felt <cf>so grateful and wonderful to have people to support each other and go on the path together!
I had not had time to think about that <cf>when I entered the [Seido] of [Tengei] before!
That ...... I, too, that ......
It was fun, you know. With God, an adventure ......
Well, that's good to hear! <cf>I feel the same way!
<cf>It's the opening festival after all. <cf>Why don't you go have some fun, too, instead of just doing your miko work?
<cf>Why don't you go have some fun with Erinze?
The crowds are a bit ....... <cf>And Lugerio will scold you.
I see. ...... <cf>So, why don't we at least have a view of the harbor?
It would be sad to say goodbye like this.
I suppose so. <cf>I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to at least look at it from afar.
...... yeah......
Well, ......!　It's beautiful.
Everyone seems to be having fun. Good for you.
Is God enjoying ...... too?
Yes, of course. <cf> I've never seen such a beautiful sight!
It's thanks to Einlein's help.
I am such a ......
I'm glad you were pleased, even if it was ......
May <cf> Buffalia's blessings be with you in Asterlys!
I see that the people of this era enjoy <cf> many festivals, such as the Star Spirit Festival and the Port Opening Festival!
I wish Tirith could see them. <cf>I would be so happy if we could go around the festivals together!
I <cf>have to learn how to enjoy the festivals<cf> well for that time!
<span size="Big">Fishing is hot right now! </>

Climb up on the stilt and dance to the <cf>lively music</cf>!
Enjoy a different view of Asterleaze at night!
Enjoy the special atmosphere that is only available now~~!
Hey, you!　Hey you! Have you been to <cf>Asterleaze Beach?
They've decorated the beach and built a huge barge on ......<cf>the ocean, just for now!
By the way, my favorite spot is <cf>the view from the top of the yurt!
Please come and visit!
Welcome! <cf>Welcome to the Two-Faced Coin Pavilion!
Did I scare you? <cf>Actually, we decided to continue "Baito" a little longer!
I was feeling depressed <cf> sitting around doing nothing while waiting for Tillis to find me ......
I talked to Jake about it, and he said <cf>I could work here.
I will do my <cf>best</cf> not to break any dishes this time!
So please treat me as <cf> Erinze, the waitress here!
Well then, my dear customers. <cf>Please make yourselves at home!
I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for a long time.
You can see the ocean and enjoy the breeze. ...... <cf>I always thought it was a wonderful place!
When I take a break like this, it's really pleasant and ......<cf>heals both my mind and body!
I would love to enjoy a cup of tea here with Tillis and everyone else!
I can't wait to see the beautiful sea while I'm here. ...... <cf>I can't wait for that day!
Jake asked me to <cf>look for fish for the coin pavilion,</cf> and I've come here to find some. ......
I heard that you can get <cf>fish by fishing here!
I have never seen fishing before! <cf>It must be a lot of work to prepare even one fish!
I swear that from now on, I will eat every single fish without leaving any leftovers!
Now then,<cf> I too will try my hand at fishing for fish!
...... What?　Fish shops and fish markets......? <cf>Well, there are stores that sell them!
That's a relief. <cf>However, I am a little disappointed......
I'm running out of wooden swords for training. <cf>I'll have to order some: ......
Oh, that's a big help. <cf>Thank you for taking care of it.
<cf>I teach self-defense to the kids at my orphanage.
These are the times we live in. <cf>You have to learn how to survive on your own.
<cf>But we're running out of wooden swords to train with. <cf>They wield them so recklessly.
I've already ordered a new wooden sword, but I have to go pick it up.
The trouble is, <cf>the store is only open when I'm watching the kids.
Can you pick it up for me?
The store is behind the arena. <cf>You can just ask the owner.
I asked him. <cf>If you tell him you're Riza's messenger, he'll know.
<cf>I ordered the wooden sword from the merchant behind the arena.
I look forward to working with you.
Hello, you're here to help Riza. <cf>That's a wooden sword for training, isn't it? Thank you
Hm?　Oh, shoot! <cf>We just ran out of stock.
We got a <cf> big order from the Asterlys Guard just now.
There's a platoon leader who's kind of on a roll. <cf>["]I'm gonna train my men until they die! ["]"] or something like that.
After all, our wooden swords are cheap. <cf>But I'm also indebted to Riza-san.
I don't know what to do. ...... <cf>All right!　I'll tell you the secret to the cheapness of our wooden swords.
<cf>We actually buy the goblins' sticks from adventurers for a couple of quid.
Not the big ones they use as weapons. <cf>They are small sticks that they use to beat their animals and friends.
We call them "goblin sticks," by the way.
That's right. <cf>They don't have a good image, so they sell them with a secret identity.
<cf>They cost a lot of money when made by a proper craftsman. <cf>What's more, they're a little rough looking, but they're tough.
If you clean it well, you can use it <cf>as a regular wooden sword</cf>.
So why don't you <cf>pick up a goblin stick</cf> yourself?
Then we could have them all in stock in no time. <cf>Mr. Riza's order was for ten of them.
I'm sure you can get them if you <cf>defeat</cf> the goblins in the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon: Additional Research".
I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here to get them.
Goblin Sticks can be obtained by killing the goblins that inhabit the Claw Trails of the Giant Dragon.
I'm sure you can get ten of them in no time!
Ah, welcome back. <I see you got the wooden sword for me.
Yes, yes, this one. <cf> They're strong, cheap, and helpful.
It smells funny, but <cf>it'll wear off as you use it.
...... What's that? <cf>You're saying you have an opinion?
Well, that's okay. I'll ask someone else to <cf>pay for it and deliver it to the store.
Oh, you don't want it? <cf> No, no. Even stocking up isn't free.
You have to pay what you have to pay. <cf>......You're getting more and more complicated, you know.
Come to think of it, this looks somewhat like that one. <cf>The stick that goblins sometimes carry......
...... hahaha, I see. <cf>So you got it yourself.
You got that right?　Hahaha, that's easy to understand. <cf>I like people like you.
<cf>Well, whatever the source, <cf>I'll take it.
Thank you. Thank you, Honest Adventurer.
<cf>The children are delighted with the wooden sword you brought them.
<cf>It seems sturdy and unbreakable, even if the children wield it recklessly!
Ekkushun!　Ekkushun! <cf>Go, I'm sorry. I was sneezing a little too hard.
Ritze is always like this at this time of year. <cf>My nose is stuffy and my eyes are itchy. I can't stand it.
Oh, no. We're talking about work, right? <cf>I am Ariane. I'm a perfumer.
I was going to make a new one with materials from the Montenol Valley.
But then a monster appeared in the mountains and I couldn't get the materials.
The monsters are <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> herds of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>. <cf>The hunter blurted out that he couldn't even get into the mountains.
He even had to sneeze to get here<cf>You're not so lucky......kkkkkk!
I live in Asterlys with my daughter. <cf>We often come to Litze to buy ingredients for our perfumes.
Scent is a delicate thing, <cf>I wanted to see for myself with my nose there!
...... Well, it's a bad time of year for me, <cf>I'm totally stuffy!
Anyway, get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>. <cf>Then you should be able to get materials ......
............Buekkushun! <cf>Ugh, this time of year is really, really bad!
...... buekkushun!　<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> are in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" in the Montenol valley.
I need at least 10 of them chased off. <cf>Please ...... shush!
Huekushun!　Heck shun! <cf>Oh, welcome back to ...... Huck Shun!
...... Fuu. I've calmed down. You got rid of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>. Thank you.
Well then, I'm going to go look for materials while I'm at it. ......<cf>Ha-ha-ha-ha!　Hahkkshhhh!
Mom, are you okay from earlier?
Oh, muah. <cf>Why are you here ...... shhhh!
That's a line over here. <cf>You're not supposed to be outside this time of year.
But you know what? <cf>the flowers and grasses in the Monttenor valley are at their most fragrant now.
As a perfumer, I can't miss the season. ......<cf>Ikkushun!　Fuekkushun!
Already. Mom tries too hard. <cf>You never ask me when it comes to perfume.
That's because it's Mom's reason for living. <cf>When you smell good, it makes you happy, doesn't it?
Only Mom is <cf>occupied</cf> with fragrance until her nose goes crazy.
What, already. You're so plain. ......<cf>Ha-ha-ha!
My mother has been a big help to me. ...... Huh? <cf> Adventurer, you smell kind of nice.
There's a canyon plant stuck to your clothes. <cf>I've never seen these flowers before. Sweet yet refreshing scent.
...... might be good. I think this would work well with a combination of "fig and <cf>"lime rose".
...... really lovely fragrance......
...... Oh. Oh, sorry! <cf>It smelled so good I got carried away!
...... Um, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>If you would like, <cf>could you do me a favor?
I want <cf>fresh fig and lime-rose flowers. If possible, soon.
I have a feeling that you can make a very nice perfume. <cf>Of course I will thank you. Please do!
I want "fig" for "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" and "lime rose" for "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>".
Limerose" can be <cf>collected at "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>"!
Please help me.
Thank you very much! <cf>I'll try to mix it right away!
......Yes. As I thought, it smells very nice! <cf>How about a candidate for the new one?　Mom.
What is it? <cf>I'm suddenly motivated.
What can I say, you're my girl after all. <cf>You're so lively when it comes to fragrance.
<cf>Nothing wrong with that. I don't sneeze and make perfume like you do.
<cf>Not that matter. Take a whiff. <cf>I'm so proud of my work.
I can't. My nose is stuffy.
Oh, no!　Get it fixed, now!
Don't be absurd. I'll enjoy it when I get home.
Mmm~....... <cf>The fragrance of this moment is something that can only be produced <cf>now</cf>.
Oh my goodness. <cf>You are so full of it. Hmmm...
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>Thanks for all the help you and your son have given us.
<cf>If you ever come to Asterlys, <cf>please stop by our house!
The new fragrance from the signer. <cf>I'll be happy to serve you.
Adventurer ......?　What do you want from me?
......Lindsay's letter to me! <cf>Seriously!　Let me see it!
Is that ......?　Oh, my God.
This is the letter I wrote!
Why is it back? <cf> I asked the Bureau of Pioneer Affairs to do it right.
First you write the sender's name, right? <cf> Then you turn it over and address it to ......
What? ...... the name of the addressee and the sender are reversed! <cf>Is that so?
That's how it works. ...... <cf>That's why it came back to me, addressed to me.
Wow, I screwed up!　Not too shabby!
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry for all the trouble I put you through.
I've never written a letter before. <cf>I just learned how to write by watching and learning.
I guess the address is on the front and the sender is on the back. <cf>Okay, I've learned it this time!
Sorry to say, but... <cf>Again, could you please deliver this to Ms. Lindsay?
Lindsay is the ...... guy I've always wanted to be a part of!
I appreciate and respect you so much. <cf>I'm able to work and eat now because of her.
So I wanted to write to him once to say thank you. ...... <cf>Hey, that's kind of embarrassing, isn't it?
My handwriting is terrible, and I wrote it wrong. <cf>Please take this letter to ...... Lindsay!
She should be in the residential area by the beach. <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
Please deliver this letter to Ms. Lindsay.
He should be in the residential area towards the beach. <cf>I can't get my head around that guy. ......
What, to deliver a letter to me? <cf>Hey, that's unusual. Thanks.
I'm in the letter-writing business. <cf>I'm confident in my handwriting, even with all this.
<cf>So, letters are always for someone else, aren't they? <cf>I'm a little nervous about receiving one myself.
Hmmm...who will it be from? <cf>Hurry ......
...... What?　Jeez!　Saul!
Oh, I'm sorry. <cf>It was from an unexpected person. ......
The boy who gave me this letter, he couldn't write. <cf>His family was too poor to go to school.
He always looked at my work with envy. <cf>["]I want to try to write too!
So I taught him a little bit.
<cf>I moved away so soon, so I couldn't finish teaching him.
It says, "I got a job." ...... <cf>Gosh,<cf>...... I see. You did your best.
<cf>Sorry for my terrible handwriting. <cf>That's true. It's smudged and hard to read. ......
<cf>I'm not very good at this yet, either! <cf>I've never written such a heartfelt letter!
Thanks for delivering it, adventurer. <cf>I'll try my best not to lose to you, Saul!
I hope that one day, everyone can write. <cf>I just might be able to do something about it.
Oh, ......!　Oh, you, you ......<cf> adventurer who knows Brelin. ......
Mi, give me some water....... ......
......, gosh, puh-lease!
Thanks ....... <cf>Thanks to you, I've managed to speak now.
It's my cousin Katya. <cf>She made a crazy dish!
<cf>It was just a plain looking soup. <cf>It tasted just fine. But after a while, it was a disaster!
My body went numb and I couldn't speak ....... <cf>I finally got stuck here.
Katya doesn't know about this yet. <cf> On the contrary, he said that I made too much soup. ......
I'm going to serve that thing to the villagers and travelers! <cf>Please!　Stop with the Katya, and ......!
Well, I'm numb again ......! <cf>Kachua's house is at the end of the village!　You have to go ...... quickly!
I'm not going to be happy ...... talking to you anymore ....... <cf>And then ...... please ......!　Goggles...
...... Katya's house is ...... at the entrance to the village......<cf>Oh...... please,...... please,......! ...... quickly......!
Oh, hello there. Adventurer. <cf>Are you hungry on your journey?
Actually, I made too much soup. <cf>Please enjoy it if you like.
Eh?　Did Meris stop you?　Why?
...... Did the soup make you numb? <cf> No!
Me?　I didn't eat it, I'm fine. <cf>I have catnip, and I asked Melis to taste it for me.
Besides, <cf>I'm not supposed to eat this soup.
But what was wrong with it? <cf> Hmmm, I still wish I had the recipe.
Oh, yes. I'm sure adventurers know a lot of things. <cf>Will you help me?
I made a "celebratory wedding soup". <cf>It's a traditional Minsterhorn dish.
<cf>Every family has their own way of making it, but my mother died before she could teach me.
I can't seem to get it right from hazy memory. ...... <cf>I'd better look for a proper recipe.
So. <cf>They have a great library on the second floor of the Asterlys Settlement Office. Do you know it?
They might still have the recipe<cf> for the celebratory soup there.
So, please. <cf>Please take me to Asterlys!
<cf>They might have the recipe in the archives on the second floor of the settlement office in Asterleaze.
Please. <cf> Please take me to the archives in Asterlys.
Let's see, Minsterhorn-related literature: ....... <cf>Oh, there it is!
Yes, it mentions "The Soup of the Celebrated Wedding". <cf>It says it's a traditional dish that the bride serves to everyone at her wedding.
So brides aren't supposed to eat it. <cf>Such a shame, since I went to the trouble of making it!
Oh, ...... yeah. I'm getting married soon. Heh heh. <cf>So I should be able to make soup properly.
Good. It's got the recipe written down too. <cf>...... hmmm, but you've got most of the ingredients right.
Now I just need to make it unique to each house with different ingredients. <cf>This is the only part I remember well.
My mom used to use 'crescent mushrooms'. <cf>They are crunchy and delicious.
But crescent mushrooms have been over-harvested<cf> and now you can't find them anywhere.
<cf>So I used "Kai-Getsu Mushrooms" which have a similar taste<cf>, but I think that's where the numbing element came from.
I can't get crescent mushrooms anymore,<cf> and I can't find them at ....... <cf>But I really want to pass on my mother's taste. ......
Oh, that's right. <cf>Then why don't you put some medicinal herbs with it?
Medicinal herbs to relieve numbness...... this this this, "young mua leaves". <cf>We can get a lot of these in the mountains.
<cf>If you use both mua leaves and sea moon mushrooms, <cf>you should be able to make a numb soup.
Adventurer. <cf>Would you please go and get me some 'young mua leaves'?
I'll go home and prepare it again. <cf>I'll make a proper soup this time.
<cf>I want you to go and get some young mua leaves that grow in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>.
I'll go home and prepare the soup again.
Oh, adventurer. Thank you for bringing me <cf>'young mua leaves</cf>!
Just in time. <cf>Then I'll chop them up and put them in the pot at ......
Yes, it's done!　It's my "Celebration Soup". <cf>Melisu, try it!
...... Do you really have to eat it?
Already. You said you would give me a taste. <cf>["]Rather than sacrifice others......["]"]
Yes, but the ...... ingredients, they haven't changed, have they? <cf>I put a lot of kaigetsu mushrooms in there earlier.
It's okay. That's why I asked the adventurer for young mua leaves.
Why don't you <cf>think about not using them?
Because this is the taste of our soup. <cf>That's the one thing I just can't give up.
Haha...... I get it. What the heck if you eat poison. <cf>We've come this far, let's go out with you.
Thank you, God of Buffalia, for your grace today. <cf>Please protect us. I'll take ......
Gokuri......
......n............ Oh, that? <cf>...... mooch...... gogukuri
Eh......Eh, eh, what's this? <cf>This is soooo good!
It's mellow and deep,<cf>and maybe even better than my aunt's soup!
The crunchiness of the sea moon mushrooms and the flavor of the young mua leaves is exquisite! <cf>I've never had such a delicious soup!
It doesn't numb my tongue at all, in fact, it makes me feel healthier! <cf>I wouldn't be ashamed to serve this to anyone!
Yay!　Yay, adventurer! <cf>Thank you so much!
Now I can go to my bride with my heart in my chest. <cf>My mother will be relieved. And thank you, Melis.
Yes, yes, thank you for the food. <cf>In so many ways.
Now all I have to do is wait for my girlfriend to come home? <cf>Haven't you heard from her yet, Joanne?
Yes, he hasn't contacted me yet. That's what I always do. <cf>I don't mind waiting.
My girlfriend is also an adventurer. She's in Litze right now. <cf>She travels a lot.
If you see an adventurer named Yoan, will you tell him? <cf>Katya is waiting for you.
I'll be waiting for him with some delicious soup, <cf>so please come home soon.
The adventurer who helped the chicken! <cf>You're helping us again, aren't you?
This time, <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> is attacking <cf>your precious cow!
It's a cow! <cf>He's so cute and tasty!
I can't let them get away with it! <cf>I will punish them!
Let's work together, adventurers!
If each of us kills five of them, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> will get scared and run away!
Of course, I'm going to kill five of them, too. <cf>Because it's for Cow's sake!
Please call out to me again when you're done. <cf>Then, let's get going!
No reservation!　No mercy! <cf>No hesitation!　No mercy!
<value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/><span size="Big">They will not be tolerated! </>
OK! <cf>It's <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>"!
Let's kill 5 cows per person and <cf>together we'll keep the peace for Mr. Cow!
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> You killed <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>, didn't you?
Ata-i's perfect too! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> was driven away!
I broke up the whole herd so <cf>they can't bully the cows again!
Now we can all rest easy. <cf>Thanks to the adventurers!
<cf>The villagers thanked us, and <cf>Cow seemed very happy.
<cf>Cow was really cute! <cf>His muscles were toned and he looked so cool!
<cf>He was so pale, his skin was firm, and <cf>he looked at me with his dull eyes. ......
Oh no!　I want to eat them!
So let's eat them! <cf>Yes!　We'll share it with our adventurers!
Fresh, carefully selected, drool-worthy, freshly grated, superb loin meat! <cf>While you're waiting, I've cut it for you!
How does it look?　Beautiful red and pink color! <cf>The finest quality without any complaints!
<cf>The cow was so beautiful, I'm sure it will be delicious! <cf>Oh, I'm drooling... Wipe, wipe, wipe!
<cf>The stripes have been removed and there are no unnecessary scratches. <cf>I'm confident in my skill with a beef knife!
What's the matter?　Is there something wrong? <cf>Please don't hesitate to accept it. Please take it!
Thank you very much! <cf>Please help me again when Cow gets bullied!
<cf>Thank you for talking to me! <cf>Thank you for listening to me...
My name is Blue Lynn. <cf>I am a bard born here in Minsterhorn.
<cf>My specialty is in the genre of specialty songs! <cf>I'll sing the local stuff wherever I go!
So here's how it goes. I thought I'd start by singing about <cf>this village where I was born: ......
Now it's time to go to Minsterhorn!　but as I thought about it, I didn't know <cf> what to sing about.
So I thought~♪
Someone like you, who is not from this village, <cf> might have a different perspective
Let's make up a theme to be sung in this village <cf>together</cf>.
I need to hear from the people of the village. <cf>Not someone dabbling like me.
<cf>Me to interview them?　I can't do that. <cf>I'm too busy talking about the old days to make any progress.
If you come up with something based on everyone's stories, <cf>please talk to me again. I'll be waiting!
I'll talk to everyone in this village, and <cf>if you come up with something, will you talk to me again?
Adventurer?　What can I do for you?
A bluerin wants to write a song? <cf>That's great. I bow to that enthusiasm.
I see. <cf>So you want me to tell you what's good about this village.
I don't know how difficult it is for me, but <cf> this is a good village!
Even an unfriendly guy like myself is <cf>accepted, and I appreciate it!
Are you talking about ...... specialty products or something a little more obvious? <cf> If so, the vegetables from the fields are all delicious!
I recommend tomatoes, which are firm and full of flavor. <cf> Celery is great not only for flavor, but also for aromatics!
If you like, you can bring some with you. <cf>If you can tell the bluerin to keep up the good work.
I recommend tomatoes and celery. <cf>All of these are delicious vegetables from Mintterhorn!
If you can tell the Blue Lynn to keep up the good work.
Welcome back. Did you have anything to say that might be useful for songwriting<cf>?
Roddy to share his vegetables with you? <cf>Tomatoes and celery. These are fresh.
You're right, the vegetables here have always been good.
Besides Roddy, we have a lot of other vegetable growers. <cf> But vegetables can be found anywhere in the Asteria Plain.
...... I see. I wonder if I can cook something with these vegetables. <cf>Would you like to go ask him for some?
I have a friend named Melis who works at a tavern.
She might be able to do something about it. <cf>Let's go.
My friend Meris might be able to make <cf>something special</cf> with these vegetables.
Let's go to her place.
Oh, no, it's not Blue Lynn. <cf>What are you doing with vegetables?
Hi, Melis. I need a little favor. <cf>Actually, ......
Make a special dish with these veggies? <cf>I don't know what to do with that kind of thing out of the blue. ......
<cf>I'm going to ask you to do something about that. <cf>You used to be a good cook, right?
<cf>I'm sorry to ruin the vegetables that Roddy gave me.
What?　Those are Roddy's vegetables? <cf>Say that quickly!
I'll make it, I'll make it! <cf>Please let me make it!
What's the matter with you all of a sudden? <cf>Oh, by the way, you've been talking about Roddy for a while now: ......
What are you talking about? <cf>We're just childhood friends!　Childhood friend!
I don't even <cf>care</cf> about Roddy!
Hmm!　I've got a melody. <cf> Sweet and sour, Melisu's love tastes like vegetables.
Kyah!　Stop it, bruin! <cf>Just wait a minute!
But still, how could that blue ling want to write a song about her hometown?
I wanted to write a song about how wonderful my hometown is now that I've seen the world.
Hmm?　I think it's a good idea. <cf>I love this village as much as you do.
Thank you!　<cf>Wouldn't it be nice if you could be honest with Lodi?
<cf>I'm just saying, it's not about Roddy! <cf>Here you go!
Tomato and celery soup, Minsterhorn style. <cf>Doesn't it smell good?
<cf> Yes, it does smell appetizing. Yes, it smells appetizing, but<cf>they're so plain!　I feel like...
Tsk tsk tsk. You're not ready to judge by its appearance. <cf>Take a bite and then tell me.
Let's see, let's eat. <cf>............!　Yum!
What's this?　<cf>It's a simple soup, but <cf>it has an incredible depth of flavor!
What do you think?　Minsterhorn is also famous for capers. <cf>The key is to use a heaping pile of them!
Lodi's vegetables and my capers. They go perfectly together! <cf>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
......, hey..!　You're eating all the time! <cf>You're listening to me!
Oh, it was delicious!　Good! <cf>I'm getting creative!
♪ ~ ...... tomatoes ~ ...... celery ~ ...... celery ~ ...... celery ~ ...... celery ~ ...... celery ~ <cf >............♪ ............ Okay!
I'm going to sing this song in the center of the village, so <cf>you can come and listen to it too!
You're still going at your own pace. <cf>You can come and listen too, if you like.
<cf>I'm serious about the song, you know. <cf>Oh, yes,...... maybe I should invite Roddy to join us too!
<cf>Bruelyn will be performing in the center of the village, if you'd like to come and hear her.
Okay, that should be a good turnout.
Thank you for your patience!　Now then, everyone, please listen. <cf>New song "Minsterhorn's Excellent Soup"
Tomato~♪ ...... isn't enough~♪ <cf>Celery~♪
♪♪♪
The key to the soup is aaaaah! <cf>Caper!　It was you!
Tomatoes!　Celery!　Minsterhorn! <cf>Mountains of capers!　Minsterhorn!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh soup!
............Yay! <cf>Thank you very much!
What's that joke song now ....... <cf>Come on, let's go home. That was a waste of time.
Eh, I was funny! <cf>I'm glad you're weird!
Me too! <cf>Tomatoes!　Celery!　Ha-ha-ha!
Hey!　Don't do that! <cf> Don't learn a strange song!
I thought it was a good song myself. <cf>I'm glad you sang about vegetables.
The soup that inspired that song, <cf>I made it!
Did you? <cf>I'd love to try it myself!
Well, then, let's go to my house now! <cf>I'll treat you to a full meal!
It seems I've won everyone's hearts in my own way, but<cf>I still need more training.
But then again, I realized something. <cf>I wanted to be something a little different than a bard. ......
I wanted to be a "publicity poet! <cf>It finally became clear. <cf>Thank you for giving me a theme for my future work.
<cf>Thank you for giving me a theme for my future work. <cf>Thank you for the reward!
Now, we must keep up the good work and promote the other villages! <cf>Good luck!
Hey, Klaus! <cf>Where did you put your luggage!
What the hell, Lucas. <cf>Delivery is such a boring job, what do you care?
I threw away my luggage. <cf>You can't deliver what you don't have.
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing, man! <cf>We took this job!
<cf>We're not going to do it! <cf> We're just going to pretend we don't know.
[<cf>All we have to do is pretend we don't know, and no one will ever know.
Don't worry. <cf>I threw it where no one would ever find it.
I threw it on the cliff behind the temple. <cf>Who's going to go looking for it?
There's a package on the ground.
Looks like it was on its way to be delivered. <cf>Someone must have left it behind.
If anyone has any ideas, <cf>I'll deliver it to him.
Hey, Klaus! <cf> Go pick up the package now!
If you do, I'll pretend the whole thing never happened! <cf>You're in big trouble for throwing away a delivery package!
Shut up. <cf>How many times do I have to tell you I don't like ......?
<cf>What's that, you? <cf>What do you want from us?
<cf> What do you want from us?　<cf>You're dressed like that! <cf>I see that you are a worthy adventurer!
<cf>We have a favor to ask of you!
I'm sorry. A simple delivery like this is not something I would ask anyone to do for me.
Hmm?　Anta, that parcel is from ....... <cf>Why do you have our package?
Geez! <cf>You didn't go down that cliff, did you!
No way!　I thought if we dumped it there, <cf>you'd never find it.
I'm sorry, again and again. <cf> That's the package we were supposed to deliver.
It looks like my partner threw it out. <cf>I'm glad you picked it up.
I know it's a trivial errand, but please take care of it. <cf>...... I have a few more things to say to this fool.
Oh, hey, Lucas. Don't get so mad. <cf>I'm just kidding, just a little ......, okay?　Nah?
I want you to deliver the package to the merchant in "Minsterhorn".
Sorry, but nice to meet you.
Oh, well, welcome. <cf> What can I get for you?
What?　You've come to deliver a package?
Hmm. Indeed, this is <cf>what I ordered.
I had some items that I needed to get in a bit of a hurry, so<cf>I asked a couple of adventurers to help me out.
I think their names are ......<cf>Klaus and Lucas.
Did these two guys ask you to do this? <cf>So, you didn't mean to impose the request on someone else?
Oh my God, ....... <cf> Anyway, thanks for carrying it for me.
I'm just sorry, adventurer. <cf>Could you please accept your reward from those two?
They insisted, so <cf>I gave them their fee up front.
I'm so sorry. <cf>How can you be an adventurer if you can't even handle a simple request like this?
You'd better go back to <cf>Asterlys</cf> before the two of them run away or something.
I'm sorry, but <cf>I gave them my fee in advance.
Can you get it from those two guys in Asterlys, ......<cf>Klaus and Lucas?
I see that you delivered the package. <cf>Thank you so much. You've been a big help.
I told my partner to be tight. <cf>Hey, Klaus. You got something to say.
Damn ....... My bad.
[I'm sorry, I know I said I was going to be an adventurer, but <cf>this is the first request I've gotten, and I don't know what I'm going to do.
Delivering packages is so plain and boring! <cf>If you're an adventurer, let's do something flashier.
<cf>Something like killing dragons. <cf>There are requests like that, aren't there?
<cf>What kind of stupidity is this guy talking, a deserter from the Knights<cf>......
Yeah, that's right. I'll give you the money I got up front. <cf>And you're the one who made the delivery.
Oh, come on!　Wait a minute, Lucas! <cf>That's the money we got!
<cf>Well, he did the job for us, so <cf>it's obvious who should pay him.
Now we're broke! <cf>Hey, let's just find the next commission!
I'll pick the next one! <cf>The one that pays properly and looks like fun!
Okay, okay, okay. <cf>Next time, don't throw me out halfway through.
You've done me a great service, you know. <cf>Next time I'll at least try not to bother people.
Ah, you're that adventurer from the other day, aren't you? <cf> You've come to the right place. A little help here.
My partner is about to do something reckless. <cf>Will you stop him with me?
What recklessness? <cf>It's just a monster strike, isn't it?
<cf>Adventurers are supposed to fight, aren't we? <cf>Carrying luggage is too dull for me!
So, let's go, Lucas. <cf>Get ready to go!
We can't do it!
Oh, come on. Are you still a member of the prestigious Order of Barnhart?
You're not a member. We're deserters.
You and I both ran away from the Order because we couldn't stand the rigors of training.
Well, that's true. ......
But we're ex-knights, even if we're rotten.
I can't do it, I can't do it! <cf>If we could beat them with our titles, we wouldn't have any trouble!
<cf>Well, you should tell him that too. <cf>Tell him that the job of an adventurer is not that easy!
Mwah. What's that look in your eyes? <cf>I'm telling you, I don't need your help.
If you can do it, why can't I? <cf>Now I'm a full-fledged adventurer!　Watch!
Hey, wait a minute!　Klaus!
He's gone. ...... <cf>Klaus says yes, but I can't!
Please, help me! <cf> He's such a guy, but he's my precious friend.
The monster I'm looking for is in the "Soundless City". <cf> But I think Klaus will get out of there as soon as he can.
He's a guy who can't do anything really dangerous. <cf>He's got to be tucked away somewhere safe.
Somewhere with soldiers or Buffalian guards or something. <cf> Any idea where that might be?　Let's go there!
You say there's a garrison at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>? <cf>I see. That seems safe enough.
Klaus might roll in there too. <cf>Let's go after him quickly!
Awww... ....... <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>So strong, so scary......
I knew it. ...... <cf> You've been running away from him because he's completely toothless.
Klaus' guy is a sight to see. <cf>I guess he was totally intimidated by the strength of his opponent.
Well, I'm glad he's okay. ......
Would you be so kind as to show Klaus what a real adventurer <cf>is capable of</cf>?
I want you to go to <cf><value type="locationName" id="dng004"/> and take out <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>.
We'll be watching from a safe distance. <cf>Of course, we'll pay you for your part in the defeat.
We'll meet back here when we're done. <cf>Thank you then.
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>I want you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/> in the "Soundless City: Additional Research".
Show <cf>Klaus what a real adventurer can do.
Good work. <cf>You've shown me how good you are at fighting.
<cf>A real adventurer is different. <cf>We're not good enough.
You're right. ...... <cf>I feel like I know my place.
<cf>I guess you get it. <cf>Nothing more reckless, okay?
Yeah. ...... I understand. <cf>I need to get back in shape first!
<cf>You looked great, man! <cf>I want to be able to fight like that!
That's why I'm going back to the knighthood. <cf> I'm going to start all over again, and train hard from the ground up!
Klaus, you ......! <cf>You've made up your mind to go back home?
But we are deserters, right? <cf>I don't know if you'll forgive us: ......
<cf>If you apologize sincerely, I'm sure they will forgive you. <cf>You will be punished a little, but that's the way it is.
Yeah,...... that's right. <cf>Of course I'll apologize, along with you.
Alright!　If you decide to do that, then get ready to go. <cf>Here you go, Lucas. Don't dawdle!
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you so much for getting Klaus back on his feet.
I know I came all this way to accompany him on his desertion,<cf> but I wanted him to become a great knight.
We'll both go back to the country and start over. <cf>I won't run away again.
If you ever come to the Duchy of Barnhart someday,<cf> you should definitely come see me.
There's a brown, stained package on the ground.
It looks very old, <cf>but it is well packed and its contents are safe.
Someone may be looking for it. <cf>If I find it, I'll bring it to you.
Oh, you've come to the right place! <cf>I am Lector. I am your colleague.
<cf>I was on my way to deliver a precious cargo when I was caught in a terrible storm.
I was stuck and in trouble!
......　You, that package!
I must have dropped it! <cf> It's very dirty,...... but I'm sure of it!
<cf>No, I'm sure of it. You picked it up! <cf>Thank you!　I've been looking for it for a long time.
<cf>Now we can finally leave. <cf>Can't you do one more job for me?
<cf> It is by the grace of the gods of Buffalia that we have met here. <cf>Take me back to Asterlys.
Thank you again and again. <cf> I will not forget your kindness, Rector here.
But that storm was terrible.
Storms and lightning and landslides. <cf> I felt like I wasn't living at all!
<cf>And neither did you, did you? <cf>It was a once-in-a-decade storm.
...... What? <cf>There have been no storms recently?
That can't be true. <cf> In fact, I was lost!
Hmmm......... <cf>Yes, my clothes are dry, <cf>and there doesn't seem to be a trace of rain on them</cf> ......
<cf>Well, let's not dwell on the details. <cf>More importantly, your luggage.
This is essential for the future of <cf>Asterlys's</cf> ...... or even for the future of <cf> humanity!
We can never let it go. <cf>As long as I have this, I cannot die even if I die!
So, <cf>please take me back to Asterlys.
<cf>I will have accomplished my mission when I return to the Pioneer Station. <cf>Please do me the favor.
For the future of mankind, this mission must be accomplished.
<cf>Please take me to the bookshelf at the pioneer station in Asterlys.
Please, please, please, please.
Oh, my God, this is ......!
A wonderful collection of books. ...... <cf>I didn't realize there was such a large collection of books......
<cf>The shelves on the wall and the books that fill them. <cf>It's just like my dream!
Books are the source of knowledge. <cf>They are the irreplaceable treasure of a society that knows the world and bequeaths it to its descendants.
<cf>They cannot slay demons, cure disease, or feed the hungry. <cf> Yet in books there is power and hope.
That is exactly what I wanted people to know. ...... <cf>I wanted to build a treasury of knowledge here in Asterlys.
I see. ...... <cf>I was not wrong in what I did. ......
Thank you. Thanks to you. <cf>This is what I wanted to see. Thank you.
One last request. <cf>Please put this book in the stacks.
My last copy of ....... <cf>Please put this poor memoir in a corner of your wonderful bookshelf.
The book is down where Lector was. <cf> I'll put it in the bookshelf of the Pioneer Bureau.
Um, what's the matter?
You've been staring at the bookshelf very intently since a few minutes ago. ......
What?　Are you with someone? <cf>No, I thought there was no one here but you. ......
Ah, perhaps you have come to donate a book? <cf>What you are bringing are books.
<cf>We're working on a book collection at the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>This "Great Bookcase of the Rectors" was created for that purpose.
It is named after a <cf>great adventurer</cf> who was active when Asterlys became independent.
Juan Lector. He was a collector of many books and left behind a valuable history for future generations.
Of course, he died 400 years ago<cf>.
He was lost in a storm on the Bahamar Plateau while carrying his books. ......
The Pioneer Bureau has decided to continue his legacy and leave various books in the <cf>"Great Bookshelf of the Rectors".
Oh, could you please donate them? <cf>Thank you very much. We will take good care of them.
<cf>Of course, we will put them in the "Great Bookshelf of Lector. <cf>By the way, it is a very old manuscript.
...... Oh?　There's something tucked into the wrapping paper.
Is this ...... an Imagine Seed? <cf>Where did it get mixed in?
It's strange, but ...... somehow<cf>it seems to give off a warm glow!
Perhaps Lector is still <cf>watching over Asterlys<cf>somewhere!
Oh, Cat-sama~! Where are you~?
You're hurt, so <cf> don't go far away~!
Ah~ I'm so tired~! <cf> I wonder if anyone strange has seen you or something.
I'm sure they're somewhere near here. <cf> Hey~. Oh, cat-sama~!
Oh, mmmm..!　Meow! ......
I found an injured cat.
It seems to be a domesticated cat. <cf> But it's scared and won't come near me.
Meow!　Meow!
It ran away.
I'll let you know if I see its owner.
Sigh~, I'm really tired~! <cf> Where did you go, cat-sama~?
...... Eh? <cf>Saw an injured cat?
Hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm...hmmm... The fur color and the gala match. ...... <cf>That's probably our house cat!
Yay! There she is, the odd one out! <cf>Thanks for letting me know, adventurer!
<cf>I don't mean to be a bother, but <cf>could you make one request for me?
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you so much. <cf> For accepting my request.
I'm an indoor person to begin with. <cf>I'm not a specialist in outside work.
<cf>Asterlys is too big to begin with. <cf>And too many cats!
<cf>That's why I'm so tired. <cf>I'd like to help the cats, too.
At any rate, Atashi, I'm going to look around here one more time.
Adventurers, please look around the town. <cf>If there are any injured cats, could you bring them to me?
Then, please do. <cf>Ha, I'm so tired!
I'm tired, but please take care of me.
O-Neko-sama~ where are you~?
I was picked up meekly. <cf>It seems like a friendly cat
The cat is staring at us.
Let me take you to Tini.
Oh, hi. Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for your help in finding the cat.
Did you find it?　The cat that escaped from my house.
Oh, I'm sorry. <cf> We had an injured cat here, too.
<cf>I wasn't the cat lady, but I was examining it.
<cf>Well, animals are not my specialty. <cf>Well, animals are not my specialty.
Oh, I see. <cf>The cat that the adventurer found is also injured, isn't it?
Which one? ...... Ah, yes, it is injured. <cf>But it's not our cat. Here it is.
<cf>My cat has a bit more of a cheeky look on her face. <cf>It's usually hard to tell the difference between cats.
<cf>Yes, yes, don't worry. <cf>I'll take care of you too. I know it's tiring, but...
So, I'm sorry. I'm sure there are <cf>other injured cats out there, so could you please look for them again?
They might be on the roof or in some other awkward place. <cf> See, cats have that kind of thing.
<cf>Wow, I'm really tired. <cf>So, let's get him quickly!
Did you look for it on the roof? <cf>It's quite common for cats to climb up there.
Our cat might be there too. <cf>Please do!
Well, there are a lot of roofs crazy ....... <cf>It's so tiring, really!
I tried to pick it up and it scratched me: ......
The cat started to wriggle to escape.
Let's get him to Tini's before he runs away.
Oh, adventurer. <cf> Did you find the cat, sir?
Ehhhhh?　He's not just another person, he's <cf> another cat, isn't he?
There's a little too much injured cat, isn't there? <cf>What's going on in this town?
Oh, I'm so tired of it. It's really bothering me. <cf>Ah, that's enough. I get it.
Adventurer. Change of plans.
Would you <cf>please bring in every single injured cat?
It's already a pain in the ass, so <cf>I'll just treat them all together.
Oh, well. <cf>We should have done that from the beginning.
<cf>Well, if we catch them all, <cf>one of them will be our cat.
Hey, you guys. Get away from me. <cf>Not on my shoulder. <cf>Don't get on my shoulder. Don't get on my lap either.
I'll fix you all up, so just wait and see.
Well, I'll just sit back and take care of them.
Every last one! <cf> Please, adventurer!
If we catch every last one, <cf>my cat will be there too!
Please search every corner of the city!
Oh, no, I'll fix you right up, so don't worry about me~!
When you find all the cats, take them to <cf>Tini!
You can do this at ....... <cf>Yes, we're done!
Ah, it's finally over!
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry I got you into such a mess.
<cf>I ended up rounding up all the cats in town. <cf>We would have been in trouble if it weren't for you adventurers!
Thanks to you, we found our cat. <cf>We can finally go home. Ah, it's so tiring!
We've taken care of them and fed them. <cf> They should be quiet for a while.
Thank you very much. Here, thank you.
Yes, yes, cat. I'm going home~. <cf> Ah, it's been really tiring!
Can I get a little bonus? <cf>Please ask your master to do the same for you, cat-sama.
Could it be that you are an adventurer who came here <cf>at the request of the Pioneer Bureau?
Thank you!　I am Cyril, the client. <cf>Well, I'm sorry for such a dubious request.
It was a little difficult to ask in a loud voice. <cf> Actually, there is something I want you to bring me in secret.
It's ...... "Crab"!
Shhhh!　Your voice is so loud! <cf>What if someone hears us?
<cf>Asterleaze is famous for its seafood. <cf>I'm sure adventurers eat it all the time.
<cf>The only exception to this rule is crab. <cf>You can't even find them at the market, can you?
<cf>The fishermen don't like crabs because they eat everything and devour the sea.
<cf>"If you eat crabs, you will devour everything as well,<cf>" the legend goes.
That's why it is forbidden to eat crabs even in the Temple of Buffalia in Asterlys.
However, strictly speaking, they only avoid eating them, but it's not forbidden by doctrine.
And since we're not in Asterlys, <cf>we're not afraid to eat it, either!
Well, when I realized that, I was really surprised. <cf>I thought, "If I go to the garrison, I can eat crab!　I thought.
Well, the problem is that I can't move from here, so <cf>I can't get the crab</cf>. ......
So, I asked the adventurer to help me out. <cf>Could you please get me a cup of "Aster Crabs"?
<cf> I'd like to get a cup of aster crabs. <cf>The common people count crabs as "cups". <cf>Did you know that?
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" I think the only way is to catch them. <cf>I recommend collecting it at a point near the water!
They don't sell them in Asterlys, so I'm asking you to do it for me. <cf>Please don't tell anyone!
Aster crabs" are not sold in stores, so you have to catch them at <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>".
I recommend that you collect it at a point near the water. <cf>Please don't tell anyone!
Wow!　A big "Aster crab"! <cf>You really caught it, that's amazing!
It was worth asking the adventurer. <cf>It's rare to see crabs!
<cf>If we lived in Asterlys, they wouldn't let us eat them because it would be bad luck.
This, this, this!　This is it, this is it! <cf>Bold scissors. <cf>Busty scissors!
<cf>Wow, isn't this the best drink ever? <cf> I wonder what it tastes like!
<cf>I think it's best to eat it simply, boiled or grilled.
<cf> I hear that the meat inside the shell is also very tasty. <cf>What?　How do you know so much about it?
That's because I heard it from someone who actually ate it.
<cf>The more people tell me not to eat it, the more I want to eat it. <cf>There are a lot of people like that.
Even the receptionist at the pioneering bureau has a ...... page. <cf>I'm sorry. Please don't go any further.
<cf>I swear to the God of Buffalia, I can't sell out my comrades who are pursuing the path of "food".
<cf>Anyway, thank you very much! <cf>I will never forget this debt of gratitude!
I'll disappear while I'm eating so that you won't find me. See you later!
Oh?　We meet again, adventurer. <cf>Have you come all the way here to listen to my lecture?
Excellent inquisitiveness. Very well! <cf>So, let's get right to the new interpretation about the visitors: ......
Oh, no? <cf>...... way, that thing requested to the Pioneer Bureau.
Hmmm. I do remember that it's been <cf>some days</cf> since we started excavating.
Preserved food?　...... Oh. It's true. <cf>It's gone. When did that happen?
No, but. We can't leave here. <cf> Because!　Look at this!
This!　This buried tablet!　Here! <cf>It says "Raiji ......" and "...... Kai"!
Do you understand?　...... Yes! <cf>'Raiji' and 'Kaijikai' for sure!
At last!　I am!　I have found the <cf> clue that connects the Raijin and the Kaisho!
Ah, but!　What a surprise! <cf>The excavation tools have broken!
O God!　<cf>Why do you bring trials to me in the face of the truth?
...... What?　Oh, my God! <cf>You will dig it out for me!
That's wonderful! <cf>You want to explore the truth too!
Then let's dig! <cf>Good, let's dig!　Come on, come on!
There are five stone slabs left. <cf>I'm sure we can find them by collecting ore in the "Andorra Basin"!
<cf>I will not leave until the excavation is finished!
There are 5 stone slabs that would connect the visitor to the founder. <cf>They should be buried somewhere in the "Andorra Basin"!
Perhaps they are among the ores. <cf>If you do some collecting, there's a good chance you'll find them!
You have unearthed all the stone slabs! <cf>Amazing!　<cf>Thank you, God!
I can read!　You can read! <cf>......Raiji......Kai......
This is ......!
...... 'The entrance to your visit is on the second floor' ......?
Visit ...... the second floor of ...... your visit ....... <cf>......Raiji......Kai......
Looks like ...... just an old information board. <cf>It must have been weathered from being discarded.
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Raiji or the founder.
Haha!　Well, this is what learning is all about. <cf>Much of our hard work ends up in vain!
But it is also true that the accumulation of that futility leads to <cf>truth!
History is the accumulation of human deeds. <cf>A small event can make a big history.
<cf>The fact that we dug up the information board here <cf>may have great significance in the history of future generations.
Nevertheless, we have put you through a lot of unnecessary trouble. <cf>Let's go home quietly here.
If you make a request to that thing every time, <cf>I may eventually charge you a fee for your services.
Thank you for your help. <cf>Next time, let's have a long talk.
You know that <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>camp near here where they live?
They've been trolling <cf>Minsterhorn</cf> for a while now.
And every time they do, the settlement office sends out a request to take them down.
That's the request I got. ......<cf>, don't you think it's better to cut off the source?
As long as the camp is there, <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>they'll keep coming <cf>without warning.
And they come back to Minsterhorn. <cf>This is the same thing over and over again!
<cf>So I thought I'd give them a thorough beating. <cf>That's why you're here.
The Pioneer Bureau told us to get rid of you, but <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/>we don't want to lose anyone.
Let's help Minsterhorn out ourselves!
Yes, ....... If you kill five of them, that's good enough for me. <cf> That camp will be useless.
I'll take care of the rest of them too. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet back here.
The <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>that attack Minsterhorn live in a camp near here.
When we're done killing 5 of them, <cf>we'll meet up with you back here!
Hey, man!　That's awesome, dude!
I caught a glimpse of you fighting. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_00_01001"/> was a little too close for comfort!
Well, that was exhilarating. <cf>They ran away with their tails between their legs.
That should quiet them down for a while. <cf>All right, all right, all right. All is well.
And?　Look at that!　Thanks to you, we <cf>have</cf> plenty of material to work with!
I couldn't have done it alone. I wouldn't have gotten half of the <cf>materials!
Especially the fur! <cf>I've got contacts that can get me a good price.
Hmm?　Oh, yeah. <cf>I said we'd both make more money because of the materials.
The more <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> you kill, the more material you get. <cf> See?　That was a tasty story, wasn't it?
This is why you can't stop defeating monsters<cf>!
Now, let's pull out. <cf>Thank you. You've been a big help.
If I see you again somewhere, I'll be counting on you then too. <cf>See ya!
Thanks for taking care of me. <cf>This is "Kagemoishi".
It seems to be a fossil of old algae. <cf>It can be used as a medicine when it is processed.
<cf>We sometimes go digging, but lately there have been a lot of monsters.
<cf>It's not safe to mine anywhere else, except in the tunnels we control.
But you're an adventurer, you're good at it, right? <cf>That's why I'm asking you to do the digging for me.
Three pieces should be enough. <cf>That shouldn't take too long.
<cf>I've already talked to a doctor named Volker in Larpal. <cf>I've already talked to him, so please take them directly to him.
<cf> "[Shadow stone]" can be mined at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>.
Please take it <cf>in person</cf> to a doctor named Volker in Larpal. I'm counting on you.
Oh, I've been waiting for you! <cf>I know you brought me the "Shadow Algae Stone".
A stone delivery for a doctor, huh?　Gahaha!
Boring, huh?　Well, never mind. <cf>It's a doctor's job to put patients at ease.
Let's see what you got.
Oh, I like it!　It's a top quality "Shadow Algae Stone".
This is it. <cf> It's used as an ointment to treat sore feet. It works well.
Larpal is at the knee of the sacred pillar. <cf>Isn't it a famous Buffalian pilgrimage site?
<cf> In the Buffalo-Brahman religion, they say that the more you suffer on the pilgrimage, the better off you'll be.
You all get shoe scrapes walking on the mountain paths, but <cf>you don't heal them. Idiots!　Gahaha!
<cf>After the pilgrimage is over, they cry to a doctor like me.
I have no choice but to wait for you like this, <cf>with medicines ready and waiting for you.
If you've got a sore shoe, I'll fix it right up! <cf>No?　That's fine!
I used to make these deliveries for Baumann's <cf>son.
His name's Einar. Rumor has it he left Litze and became an actor.
If you see him, tell him I missed him. <cf>Baumann must miss him too.
Oops, I almost forgot to thank you. <cf>You take care of your feet, too. Gahaha!
(......ッ!　You've been seen ......?)
...... Hello, adventurer. <cf>What's wrong with you in a place like this?
It's dangerous to walk down a dark alley. <cf>You might get caught in an unexpected place, in an unexpected way!
<cf>I think it's important to leave stranger's children alone.
Curiosity in moderation. ...... <cf>Uh-huh. Have a good day, then.
(still following ......)
...... How are you doing, adventurer? <cf>There's nothing beyond this point.
You wouldn't happen to be following me ......<cf>, would you?
I can't believe I followed a kid in an alleyway. <cf>I don't know if they look at me funny, okay?
I don't care if you shout louder. ...... <cf>Let's keep this place nigh.
Please don't let it get to this point. <cf>This is for your own good. Good bye.
Mr. Adventurer: ....... <cf>I'm not impressed with you following a girl around.
I nailed you so hard, <cf>I can't believe you came all this way.
But ...... I'm sure you followed me <cf>because you were worried about me.
You must have been <cf>concerned</cf> to see a child walking alone in an alleyway.
Ummm. Thank you. Oh ......
I'm sorry. I have tears in my eyes: ......
I've <cf> never had someone care about me like this before. ......
Maybe ...... I wanted someone like you to <cf>call out to me!
Kind adventurer. <cf>Would you please listen to me?
What I would like to ask you to do is to dispose of this burlap sack. <cf>I was originally asked to do this.
You see, it's big enough for a grown man to <cf>hold</cf>, isn't it?
It's too bulky and heavy for me to carry.
Is it the contents?　......Yes, that's right. <cf>[--]A dead pig.
It was also one that had died of a contagious disease. <cf>I have to dispose of it in a place where people can't get to it.
......?　What's wrong? <cf> Oh, never mind.
<cf>It's not uncommon for a kid like me with no relatives to get a job like this.
<cf>A big city like Asterlys creates a lot of dirty jobs.
Don't worry. <cf>It's not often that an epidemic infects people.
<cf>If you go east through the "Minster Hills," you will come to the ocean. <cf>Then just throw it away.
When you are done, could you <cf>let a man named Mr. Koshimo know?
He is the client of the job. I will let him know so that he can <cf>pay the adventurers for their services.
Please do not look in the bag. <cf>It makes me feel bad, and
[--]"Curiosity kills cats," so they say.
Ufufu, please don't look so scared. <cf>Thank you, then.
As for the burlap sacks, if you go east through the "Minster Hills," <cf> you'll come to the ocean, and you can throw them out there.
When you are done, could you <cf>let Mr. Koshimo in Asterlys know?
Even though it's a dead pig, it makes me sick, so <cf>please don't look inside the bag!
The burlap sack Niki gave me, <cf>I threw it into the sea.
Let's report this to Koshimo in Asterleaze!
Hi-yi-yi-yi! <cf> Don't come, don't come!
<cf>You can't kill me, you can't kill me! <cf>Your friends will be here soon!　I'm gonna get you back!
So get the hell out of here! <cf> Stay away from me!　Get away from me!
...... Hey, what the hell. You look like you don't know what you're talking about. <cf> You look like you don't know what you're talking about.
Don't play dumb with me! <cf> You're one of Niki's guys!
<cf>Someone saw you take the bag Niki gave you!
<cf>You just asked me to ...... ......? <cf>That's why he said you cleaned up after ...... him!
Don't tell me ...... you don't really know Niki? <cf>Oh, so ...... that's why you came over and helped him out?
You're a disaster too, ....... He may be a kid, but <cf>he's a real assassin.
There's no one in that line of work who doesn't know that. <cf>If he catches your eye, that's the last thing you want to do. He'll fuck you up for sure.
Niki found my partner. <cf>He's probably out there somewhere feeding off the fish right now. ......
Look at the notice. You're next. <cf>...... my buddy's finger was enclosed.
All his crew ran when they heard Niki's name. <cf>I'm done!
......Hey, please. I'll give you all the money I got. <cf>Take me to the temple of Buffalia!
I've had enough of this. I'll wash my feet. I will repent. <cf> I'd rather be caught than have my life in danger!
Niki's guy will kill me if I walk alone! <cf> Please!　It's for my own good!
Niki's guy will kill me if I don't! <cf>Take me to the Temple of Buffalia!
<cf>Take me to the Temple of Buffalia!　I'm the lastborn!
Welcome to the Temple of Buffalia. <cf> hmm ......?　You're Koshimo, the moneylender, aren't you?
Sir!　Please, let me in!
What?　What kind of windbag is that? <cf> You know what I mean.
Your business practices are beyond reproach. <cf> I've even got a written arrangement going around from the Guard.
Does that mean you're willing to turn yourself in knowing that? <cf> Or else I will not allow you to enter the sacred temple.
That's fine!　Just let me in! <cf>I'll hear as many sermons as I want later!
I've come to contemplate, just like you said! <cf>Hurry up and help me!
What are you in such a hurry for? <cf>Okay, okay. Be quiet for a minute, all right?
I told you to come here, but you wouldn't listen to me. <cf> Anyway, let's hear what you have to say.
[--]Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Adventurer.
The Koshimo guy got caught quietly. <cf>We'll be turning him over to the guards soon.
After that, he's going to jail. <cf>There's nothing we can do about that. <cf>He's a man who's done that much.
<cf>But still, I never expected that notorious loan shark to come to me for repentance.
<cf>We told him again and again from the temple to turn himself in, but he wouldn't listen to us.
It was as if he had changed. <cf>He was frightened a lot, but what happened?
Well, if he repents, good for him. I've taken care of you. <cf>Here is the temple's gratuity. We would like you to pay it to us.
Maybe this will make the city a little easier to live in. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation. Now then...
What am I doing here? <cf>Can't you see?
I'm collecting material for a costume. <cf>I'm a fashion designer.
I'm launching a new brand, so <cf>I need to show off my originality!
Yes, that's right. <cf>If you're an adventurer, you can collect materials from outside the city, right?
Come take a peek at my store if you like. <cf>Maybe I can do you a favor. See you later!
<cf>If I see Thierry in town, let's talk to him.
Oh, that adventurer from earlier. <cf>Welcome to my shop, you're here!
Hmmm ....... I thought that even under the cliff, <cf>you ...... are nice!
I took one look at you and I was like...!　I was like. <cf>You have great taste, and most importantly, you're a good person!
Can you <cf>help me get the store ready to open?
Thank you! <cf>I was short on material for costumes.
I've collected <cf>most everything I could find in Asterlys.
<cf>There are still a few things left that can only be found outside of town.
First, three pieces of "horned goat wool". <cf>I love that fuzzy feeling!
Then, five "phosphorescent threads". <cf>It's essential to create a gorgeous effect.
Also, please give me five "shanarigusa". <cf>It makes the fabric very smooth. Did you know that?
I'm sorry it's kind of a lot. <cf>But you'll be fine, right?
<cf>I'm sure you'll bring me some good quality ones. Well then, good luck!
We need a lot of costumes for the opening, so <cf>I'm sorry to ask for so many!
All of the things I asked for can be found at <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" on the Baha Mar Plateau.
The "horned goat wool" can be obtained from <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_00_01001"/>.
Phosphorescent thread" comes from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>.
You can go ahead and cut the shanary grass.
I <cf>believe</cf> you'll bring us something of good quality. Thanks for your help!
I'm so glad you gathered it for me. Thank you! <cf>Which one? ......
Mmmm, the color and the shine. And the texture. <cf>It's perfect!　Top of the line!
I'm so proud of you for having such a great selection. <cf>I knew I was right!
This is going to be a great addition to the brand. <cf>Okay, let's do it!
Watch this. Asterlys, the fashion capital of the world! <cf>I'm going to dye it up with my brand!
<cf>I'm still on the edge of being a warrior. <cf>I will be a good judge of character.
<cf>Will you lend me your military prowess? <cf> I am sorry.
I have heard that when one expresses one's will, one should have a corresponding "proof" to back it up.
In my hometown, there is a ceremony in which a grass doll or a human-shaped piece of paper is <cf>made to resemble the person one is expressing one's intentions to.
It seems that, although things change from place to place, people still put their strong feelings into something and use it as their <cf>testimony.
It is also said that sometimes people put their loyalty, affection,...... or even their grudge into it.
Oops, I digress. That's why I want to make use of the "testimony".
I have been looking for materials for that purpose, but <cf>I am somewhat short of time.
By the next full moon...... at the latest, <cf>we must settle the matter.
<cf>I should be the one to do it. <cf>But here, I humbly ask for your help.
I want you to obtain eight each of the Red Fangs of Rumblebore and <cf>Dong Zero Ore</cf>.
I can only ask you to do this if you are skilled. <cf>Please help us.
The materials I want you to collect are <cf>Rumblebore Red Fangs and Cave Zero Ore.
<cf>"Cave Zero Mine" can be found in the Melissos River Valley.
The "Red Fang of Rumblebore" can be obtained from <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>" <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>.
We must settle this before the next full moon, so <cf>please help us!
Dear adventurer! <cf> You have gathered the materials I requested.
Oh, what magnificent red fangs! <cf> The glow of the "Cave Zero Ore" is also wonderful!
<cf>As I thought, there was nothing wrong with my eyes. <cf>A brilliant move. I am in awe!
<cf>That's right, I've just gathered the necessary materials. <cf>I'm sorry. Everything is now in place!
Now all that remains is for me to make the proof myself. <cf>I have also prepared nails and hammers.
<cf>With all this work and care, I am sure that my desire will be fulfilled!
<cf>I will never forget your help. <cf>This is just a small token of my gratitude. Please accept it.
Excuse me, Feodor! <cf> I thought you said it wasn't going to rain!
<cf> I thought you said it wasn't going to rain! <cf>Thanks to you, my laundry is soaking wet!
<cf>Calm down, ma'am. <cf>A weather forecast is just a forecast. It can go wrong.
I was surprised that it rained, too. <cf>Weather is sometimes beyond human prediction: ......
No need to quibble! <cf>It was a mistake to trust you just because you're a scholar.
<cf>That's a hell of a whack job to say "I can guess tomorrow's weather," <cf> I'll give him that!
Oh dear. ...... <cf>Sorry to have caused such a ruckus.
It's just as you asked. <cf>I am trying to make 'weather forecasting' a reality.
Not just tomorrow's weather ......, but <cf> I want to be able to accurately forecast weather changes!
As part of my daily routine, I forecast the weather for the next day every day. <cf>The next few days will be sunny.
I was saying that, and then it rained, and <cf>the lady was thunderstruck</cf>.
I mean, I couldn't have predicted the rain or the thunder. <cf>...... Yeah, not so good.
Anyway, the observation is not good enough at all. <cf>They're so inaccurate that they're not practical.
So I'd like to ask you to <cf>make some weather observations in the Asteria Plain.
I will now give you some points of interest. <cf>You will go there and activate this recorder.
It's a Buffalian legacy, so it will <cf>automatically</cf> record what you need to know. Easy, isn't it?
It's expensive, so please don't lose it or break it.
<cf>Anyone who works in research is not in the business of money. <cf>Oh, don't worry, I can get you a reward.
<cf>I can observe in the vicinity of Asterlys, so I would like to ask you to observe further afield. <cf>Thank you very much.
<cf>The observation point is the easternmost point of the Minster Hills.
The southwesternmost point of the Andorra Basin
The westernmost point of the Evening Calm Terrace.
Activate the recorder there. <cf>Thank you.
Weather in the Minster Hills.
Meteorological record of the Andorra Basin.
Weather logged for the Evening Calm Terraces.
Hey, thanks for your help. <cf> I see you've completed your meteorological observations.
Oh, this is wonderful! <cf>You've made some valuable records. Thank you.
...... My family used to be on a <cf>liner to Barnhart, and we got caught in a storm.
The ship sank and my family never returned. I still wish <cf>I could have foreseen the storm ......
Maybe it's not for man to know the future. <cf>I've been asked if I want to be a god.
It can be a source of laughter. <cf>If you want to know what the weather will be like tomorrow, you'd better rely on a fisherman's instinct, because it's much more accurate.
And yet, if we continue to make steady observations, <cf>someday we will be able to predict the onset of a storm or a drought.
Sunshine or rain. We don't even know now, <cf>but we still need weather forecasting.
Not only is it useful, <cf>I believe it can save many lives.
......I've talked too much. <cf>Something about you seems to open people's minds.
I'll ask again. <cf>I need your help for the future of weather forecasting.
The package I asked for has not arrived at your mansion. <cf>I am in trouble.
It has the seal of the Asterlys Council in it, so <cf>the bandits shouldn't be able to get their hands on it. ......
The luggage is scattered all over the place. <cf>It looks like it was ransacked by monsters.
The luggage tag has the seal of the Astelleries council on it.
It could be an important piece of luggage. <cf>I can't deliver it all, but I can deliver the packing slip.
I'll let you know if there's anyone waiting for the package.
I put the seal of the Astelleries Congress in the package, but <cf>I can't believe the package is missing: ......
...... Oh?　Dear Adventurer. <cf>You seem to have a luggage tag.
Did you pick it up on the ...... Baha Mar Plateau? <cf>And your luggage was ransacked by monsters, and
It may be a <cf>package</cf> that was supposed to be delivered to our mansion!
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Are you busy?
My master is in somewhat of a bind. <cf>If you would be so kind as to assist me.
<cf>My name is Giles, the butler. <cf>Please make my acquaintance.
<cf>I serve Councilman Dalton of the Asterlys Council.
Do you know him?
He is the man responsible for the management of the port of Asterlys.
He himself is an avid trader, and trades in goods through a variety of channels.
However, the important cargo has not arrived. ......
<cf>As the ship is about to sail, all the servants have been searching for it.
I believe that you may have found the package that we are looking for.
Would you be so kind as to <cf>please escort me to the location?
Let's <cf> hurry up and get there before our luggage gets ransacked again!
I wonder if you could take me to the place where you picked up the <cf>package tag</cf> of <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>?
This is the luggage you <cf>found</cf>.
There is no doubt about it. <cf>It belongs to Senator Dalton.
There are goblin footprints all around .......
There are no bloodstains, so <cf>the people who were carrying it must have escaped.
What's left of it is ......? <cf>Let's take a look inside.
This is a ...... goblin pelt, isn't it? <cf>No, but ...... there are too many!
This box here and that one over there are the same. <cf>These are all materials that can be taken from goblins!
The fact that we got so many of them means that we <cf>had to get our hands on as many......
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>Can we have a little more time with you?
<cf>There is a warehouse in the port of Asterlys that belongs to Senator Dalton.
I would like to see what is inside.
I can open the door to the warehouse. <cf>Let's go to the port of Asterlys.
Councilor Dalton has a warehouse in the port of Asterlys.
Let's head there to see what's in the warehouse.
This is Senator Dalton's warehouse. <cf>There should still be some cargo left for the next shipment.
I'll go check inside, <cf>Adventurers, please wait here.
[--]Thank you for your patience. <cf>I've checked all the cargo.
As I thought, there <cf>was</cf> a large amount of monster material in storage!
The same as those raided in the Baha Mar Plateau.
Especially goblins, mooks, and ogres. ...... <cf>Most of it seems to be from subhuman monsters.
They must have been killed in such large numbers.
I've heard that some adventurers are killing more subhumans than they <cf>need</cf> to get materials. ......
I'm surprised that there is even a trade route <cf>initiated by Senator Dalton!
...... have you noticed this yet?
I have been sent by a source to Senator Dalton's residence to <cf>investigate his background.
I have noticed something suspicious about the Councilman's trading activities.
If Senator Dalton buys materials at a high price, <cf>the number of people bringing materials there will increase.
That <cf>may result in a large number of monsters being <cf>defeated</cf>.
But will the monsters also be <cf>being beaten up one way or the other?
...... Yes, they are. <cf>It's not surprising that they would consider retaliating against humans.
Maybe the reason they raided the luggage this time was to <cf>get back the bodies of their friends. ......
It may <cf> eventually lead to a major clash between humans and subhumans<cf>.
It is not a personal problem for Senator Dalton, but <cf> a drastic solution needs to be put in place!
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks for the valuable information.
What you have seen here is not to be mentioned elsewhere.
I'm sorry to have to drag you into this, but <cf>adventurers, please take care of yourselves.
We continue to investigate Senator Dalton's whereabouts.
Please keep what we have seen confidential. <cf> We will not question the Senator until we have more evidence.
Hmmm ....... <cf>What am I missing: ......
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for the consultation.
I've actually been given an assignment by the head chef.
I have to suggest <cf>one dish for the wedding celebration.
So I made a salad, but <cf>I was told to resubmit it!
They said 'not enough of a blessing'. <cf>But I have no idea what that means. ......
Yes, I know. Would you adventurers like to <cf>taste it once?
I'd like to hear the opinions of various people. <cf>I'll prepare it right away, please!
......What do you think?
Would you like it to be a little more chewy? <cf>Yes, maybe the texture is monotonous.
Blessings......The texture is monotonous....... <cf>...... Oh, right!
Adventurer, that's it! <cf>I had an inspiration!
Sorry for the short notice. Adventurer. <cf>Could you get me some "Pear Nuts"?
It's a little far, but <cf>they're nuts you can get in the Montenol Valley.
If you have "Pear Nuts," you can complete the salad. <cf>Thank you very much!
Pearnuts' are the nuts you can get at <cf>'<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>' in the Montenol valley.
This would make a <cf>salad suitable for a wedding!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I see you brought "Pear Nuts"!
Well then, you can serve the salad at ....... <cf>All you need to do is sprinkle the "Pear Nuts" on top and you're done!
...... Okay. What do you think? <cf>Go ahead and try it!
Is it ...... delicious?　Thank goodness! <cf>Thanks to our adventurers!
<cf>The feature of "paired nuts" is that the nuts are <cf>stuffed so that two nuts are nestled together!
They are also known as "chigiri nuts" because they are harvested by tearing the nuts by hand.
The "Fruit of the Covenant" that brings two people together. ...... <cf>I thought it would be a perfect wedding gift.
The chef was also trying to get this across.
The flavor of the food and the meaning of the ingredients. <cf>I can't say I'm a full-fledged chef if I can't make the most of both!
I have to learn more and more<cf>and this time I have to be able to notice them alone.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I will train harder and become a great cook!
Oh, is it smelly?　Sorry. <cf>But this smoke gives it a nice flavor.
<cf>I know it's a source of complaints because it's smoky every time I work.
What I'd like to ask you to do is to transport the new kiln. <cf>I'm thinking it's time for a new smoking kiln.
The new kiln is a Buffalo legacy, and <cf>how they say it can smoke in an instant!
Smoked food is delicious, and it's a good preservative, but it takes a long time to make.
If it can be done in an instant, it's amazing. <cf>I really want to try it!
And I've asked someone I know to <cf>repair</cf> it for me.
His name is Ciri, and he's a restorer of Buffalo's heritage. He's an apprentice.
He's working in L'Arpall, and I'd like you to pick up the kiln for me.
I can tell him that Paulette asked me to do it. <cf>Thanks for your help.
I would like you to <cf>pick up the kiln from Sheli in Lalparu.
I'm looking forward to receiving the kiln.
You must be Paulette's messenger. <cf>The smoking kiln, right?　I've got it restored.
But you have an unusual heritage, don't you?
I have a friend of mine, Myrlene, who studies <cf>history</cf>.
She says that the Buffalian civilization must have had plenty of food preservation techniques.
So they didn't need to bother making smoked food.
Either because it was delicious, or they made it as a hobby. <cf>She said that's the only reason she could think of.
<cf>Buffalian civilization is really amazing that they would even make such a device for that purpose.
Oh, I'm sorry. <cf>I got carried away.
Here's the smoking kiln. <cf>And to make it work, you need the "Great Kemuri Stone".
Could you <cf>pick those up on your way home and deliver them to him too?
You can find them at <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>. <cf>Three of them should be enough, please.
You can find the "large chemulite stone" that moves the kiln by <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>".
I think you can get it when you collect the ore.
When you have finished collecting the ore, please deliver it to Paulette in Asterlys with <cf>the kiln</cf>.
Welcome back. <cf>Did you get the kiln from Sheli?
Yes, this is it. <cf>Buffalo-Buffalo-Buffali-Momentary Smoke Kiln.
Oh, even the "Great Kemuri Stone". <cf>She's so thoughtful. Thanks.
<cf>The first instant smoker is for the adventurers!
Here, start it up. <cf>So cool!
<span size="Big">............! </>
...... Well, that was a hell of a smoke. <cf>kehoho, kehoho!
<cf>Everybody was freaking out, thinking it was a fire or a volcanic eruption or the smoke of a monster attack.
<cf>And they were so mad at me.
<cf>The smoking was really over in an instant.
Snap. ...... Yeah, this is charcoal.
Phew. The heat level, or <cf>smoke level, is so messed up.
The fact that it doesn't break <cf>with that thing is a legacy of Buffalia, but...
<cf>But it's not usable in the city. <cf>But it would be a disaster if it started a forest fire.
And then there's the ...... sea?
If we're in the middle of the ocean, <cf>we might not be a nuisance.
...... might think we're in distress? <cf>I see. That's a groaner no matter how you look at it.
Anyway, there's room for improvement. <cf>I'll have to talk to Sheli about it again.
Thanks again. You've been a great help. <cf>When you make a delicious smoked fish, I'll share it with you.
<cf>I'm so excited to make smoked meat today too!
<cf>No, I think they might be a little offended by that.
I'll just go outside and make it.
<cf>No, I'm not going to make it outside. <cf>That's funny.
I'm always catching "muscle fish" here.
It's a river fish native to the Monttenor Valley. <cf>They are very powerful, with muscles all over their bodies.
They come all the way up the river from downstream and can climb waterfalls with no problem.
When they catch a big fish, they can even drag humans <cf>down into the river!
<cf>I love to compare strength with muscle fish and catch them. <cf>But lately I haven't been able to do it at all, so it's boring!
<cf>I think there's a reason why the musclefish can't climb the river. <cf>But it's too dangerous to go outside the village.
<cf>see if there is something going on downstream. Please do.
I think there is a reason why the musclefish can't climb the river. <cf>Please go check downstream of the river. Please do.
The water in the river is swirling a lot. <cf>Something seems to be spinning in the center.
I picked up the spinning metal parts. <cf>The whirlpool disappeared and all the muscle fish started swimming together.
The parts I picked up seem to be of Buffalia heritage. <cf> Let's take it back to Hubby.
<cf>It seems the metal parts prevented the musclefish from climbing up the river.
Let's bring it back to Hubby.
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>Look, look, look. The musclefish made it up the river!
Did you find anything?　Let me see. Let me see.
Hmmm. This is what I found in the river. <cf> Parts of a Buffalian legacy, I guess.
Looks like just a couple of metal plates that go around and around. <cf>What's it good for?
Making a whirlpool in the bathtub, or when doing the laundry? <cf> You can stir the pot with your hands, right?
Oh, maybe it's for training muscle fish! <cf> They make a whirlpool with this to strengthen the muscles of the muscle fish!
<cf> I'll show this to my grandpa. I'll show this to my grandpa. <cf>My grandpa is a Buffalologist!
Thank you very much! <cf>Here's a fish for you. Take it.
Now, let me challenge you to a game!
Why not?　It's obvious!
It's because I'm a Soldier and ......<cf> you're an adventurer!
That's not an answer, is it?　......
If you want answers, you're going to have to beat me!
There's been an outbreak of monsters in the area, and a request has been issued to take them down.
Let's see who can kill more of them!
First, we'll take down <value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Don't be surprised, okay?　I already have ......
9 of them!　I've already defeated them!
Huh. How's that sound? <cf>If you beat 10 of them, you win!
Then I'll admit defeat gracefully<cf>and tell you why I challenged you to a fight!
I'll be waiting for you here. <cf>A winner always wears a margin of victory.
If you can kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>, you win!
Already 9 of them!　I'm waiting for you <cf>here</cf> as I'm defeating them!
What? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_00_01001"/> You killed 10 of them. ......
<span size="Big">Ba, are you a monster or ......? </>
...... got it. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_00_01001"/>I admit defeat!
And the reason why I challenged you to a match: ....... <cf>Hear my sad past!
I was born the eldest son of a poor family. <cf>I have always told my six younger brothers that I am the strongest.
<cf>At first it was just a silly lie, <cf>but it became their emotional support.
<cf> They still believe<cf> that I am the strongest of them all.
Therefore!　I must be the strongest! <cf>I am strong and alone, unbeatable by anyone else!
That is the reason! <cf>Nobody can rise above me!
For that reason, I challenge you once more to a match! <cf>Next is the defeat of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>!
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_00_00_01001"/> is a small test. <cf>Don't be surprised. I already have <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> at ......
14 of them!　I've killed them!
Huh ....... How's that? <cf> To beat me, you have to beat 15 of them.
Can you beat me, this man who has gained<cf>true strength with a past that cannot be told without tears!
If you can defeat 15 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>, you win!
Already 14 of them!　I'm the strongest one you've beaten, <cf>I'm waiting for you here!
What the hell? You killed 15 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>?
<span size="Big">Is there such a guy in this world ......? </>
<span size="Big">There are no more monsters in this world!
Now I admit it. You are strong! <cf>As far as I'm concerned, you're the best Soldier I know!
But you know what? <cf>I'm not defeated yet!
I am the strongest and lone Soldier, Mino! <cf>We'll settle this sooner or later!
Farewell!　...... and before that. <cf>Take this.
As a result, I <cf>helped</cf> you with your request to defeat a monster. Here's your reward for that.
The law?　...... Huh. <cf>Yes, I am the most powerful man in every sense of the word!
The lone Soldier is also the strongest in paying me! <cf>I am not stingy with such things!
Well, farewell once again!
Well, that was careless. <cf>Our lunches sure are tasty, though!
<cf>I didn't think we'd sell so much at once that we'd run out of ingredients!
So, Anta. <cf>You're going to get the ingredients for us? Thanks.
I'll take three "Sweet Mushrooms" and ten <cf>"Fluffy Wheat" please.
You can get them at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/> in the Baha Mar Plateau. <cf>Take a long run, I'm asking you!
<cf>3 "sweet mushrooms" and 10 "fluffy wheat" at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>" in Bahamar Plateau.
I've asked you to run a long way!
You brought the ingredients for my lunch. <cf>Thank you. Thanks for your help.
Please come again. <cf>We'll be at your service!
Can you take care of that for me? <cf>That would be great. Hee-hee.
Oh, that laugh is just a quirk. <cf>Don't worry about it. Hee-hee.
This is the first magic potion anyone in the world has ever made. <cf>If it works, I'll share it with you, okay?
<cf>All we need now is five fossilized centipedes. <cf>And five Xerremodoros Fruits.
These are common ingredients used in doctors' medicines. <cf>They're not suspicious, are they?
You can find them at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/> in the Baha Mar Plateau. <cf>Thanks for your time. baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
To make a magic potion, you need 5 fossilized centipedes.
I need 5 "Xaremodros Fruits" to make the potion.
You can find them at <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" in the Baha Mar Plateau.
Thanks for your help. Hee-hee-hee.
Thanks for your help. <cf>I see you brought the ingredients for the potion.
Oh yeah, this is it, this is it. <cf>"Centipede fossil" and "Xaremodros fruit.
Let's boil them up as soon as possible, shall we? <cf> Hmm?　What kind of medicine am I making?
......It's a secret between us, okay?
<cf> What I'm making is an ancient potion that can transform itself into others.
We found an ancient document in our warehouse. Heehee. <cf>Sounds interesting, doesn't it?　I'd like to try my hand at it.
It's still in the prototype stage, so <cf>I may ask you to procure some more.
<cf>I'll look forward to working with you then. <cf>Let's aim to complete it together. Hee-hee-hee.
Will you take care of it? <cf>Thank you.
<cf>The material for the new weapon is 15 pieces of "copper nitre".
You can find them at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/> in the Baha Mar Plateau. <cf>You will find them without much trouble.
Thanks for your help. Best regards.
Look for me at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" on the Baha Mar Plateau.
Thank you.
Nice "[fld002_E]/>". <cf>Thank you.
Sorry I'm not very friendly. <cf>I'm a man of a tight-lipped disposition.
I give my family a hard time. <cf>I just want to show them a good eye once in a while.
<cf>I just want to make some money with my new weapon and make things a little easier for them.
Thanks to you, I'll be able to make some good weapons. <cf>Thank you again.
<cf>Our daily lunch boxes are very filling and nutritious.
Today's was well done. <cf>But I wanted a little more color.
Can you bring me 15 red ball beans?
They're growing in the Montenol Valley at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>. Don't drop it on the way.
15 <cf>"red ball beans" from <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/> in the Monttenor valley. Please.
Oh, "red ball beans". <cf>They're nice and round.
The more nicely rounded they are, the better these beans taste.
Around Litze, <cf>I hear they roll off the mountain every once in a while.
Now you can make a convincing lunch box. <cf>Thank you!
Hey, welcome. <cf>Ordered a makeover potion?　You're right, it's not ready yet.
Don't panic, baboon. <cf>First we need to mix up a base potion, and then we'll get started.
That's why I need your help again.
<cf>I'm making the potion in secret, you know. <cf>Only someone who knows what's going on can help me. Hee hee hee.
All I need is eight fir barks and five freshwater marlin fins.
They are the ingredients for a very tonic medicine. <cf> But good quality is hard to find.
I trust your eyes. <cf>You can get them at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/> in the Montenol Valley.
Best regards, and I'll be waiting for you. <cf>I'll be waiting for you. Hee-hee-hee.
All you need is <cf>"fir bark" which you can get at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/> in the Montenol valley.
Eight "fir bark" and five <cf>"freshwater sailfish fins".
Did you <cf>get</cf> the "fir bark" and "freshwater marlin fins"?　Hee-hee.
You've got some pretty good quality stuff here. <cf> Hee-hee-hee, let's start mixing!
<cf>He says my nose is about to turn? <cf>This aroma is good. <cf> Hee-hee-hee.
I'm going to transform myself into someone else. <cf>I should at least put up with the smell.
<cf>But I'm still in the preparation stage. <cf>We have a long way to go, but I'm sure you'll help me out again.
<cf>It's not an overnight process. <cf>Be patient, be patient. Hee-hee-hee.
I was rummaging through the Pioneer Bureau's archives and <cf>found a new way to make weapons.
No, it's an old one in terms of chronology. <cf>The technique was developed around the time Asterlys became independent.
So about 400 years ago. <cf>I heard that the technique was lost.
But I looked it up, and it seems to <cf>still work today.
I thought I'd give it a try.
The materials needed are 5 pieces of "Kosatetsu" and 15 pieces of <cf>"noir stone".
The materials themselves are still available. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation.
<cf>If you are looking for them in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/> in the Montenol valley, you will find them.
<cf>You'll find it at "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" in the Montenol valley.
Thank you.
<cf>"Kosatetsu" and "Noirstone"? <cf>You have collected them well.
They are good stones. <cf> But I've never used them for blacksmithing before.
I wonder how it will turn out. <cf> Let's try following the literature first.
Thanks, man. <cf> You can come by again if you want.
You seem like a skilled guy and I trust you.
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>It's hard to do research in Berkmar: ......
Yes, it is. It's the town that was <cf>destroyed</cf> by the Avalitia disaster the other day.
There is a <cf>[oral tradition] there that is considered heretical by the Buffalians.
The content is a bit of a problem.
<span size="Big">"To join the ranks of monsters"</span>.
That's what they say about ......
Of course, such a thing is heresy in the Buffalo-Brazilian sense of the word! <cf>.
But it might give us some clues to understand the ecology of monsters, <cf>right?
The Pioneer Bureau thinks that we should <cf>explore more and more, and not just say "yes" or "no."</cf>!　That's what we think!
If possible, we would like to gather information quickly <cf>before the Buffalians get a look at us.
There is a Buffalian pilgrimage group in Berkmahal that conducts memorial services, right?
There is also a resident of Berkmahal there.
I was wondering if you could talk to that person ...... who used to live in Berkmahal about <cf>the oral tradition.
About the oral tradition of "to join the ranks of the monsters"
Could you please talk to the <cf> former resident there in Berkmahl about the <cf> oral tradition
Hmm, what is it? <cf> Am I a resident of Berkmar?
Yes, I was born in Berkmar. <cf> But I've been on the road a lot lately.
<cf>I learned about the town being destroyed by Avaltia<cf> from people I met on my travels.
So I don't know about Avalithia or anything like that. <cf>I'll listen to your story if you still want.
...... Okay, so it's oral research. <cf>Maybe you mean my grandma.
My grandma used to speak a strange language. <cf>It's not a language from any country, and I don't know what it means.
But I've seen my grandma use it to calm the <cf>monster</cf> down.
I was taught that word too. <cf> But she also told me not to use it in public too much.
It would be creepy to talk to a monster. <cf> I don't even know if I can really talk to them.
Grandma?　She died years ago.
I wonder if she would've <cf> gotten rid of Avaritia, too, if she was still alive.
...... Hey, you. <cf>While I'm teaching you, why don't you help me?
There's a nappo near here. <cf>I'd like to try the words I know on him.
<cf>With grandma gone, I'm the only one who knows that language.
If I can use that language, <cf>this time I might be able to save the city!
You want to know more about the oral tradition? <cf> Then come with me.
I'll actually use it right in front of you. <cf>In return, you'll be my escort.
You want to know more about oral traditions, don't you?
There's a nappo near here. <cf>I'd like to test my knowledge of the language on him.
Take care of my escort, man.
Oh ......, I found a nappo. <cf>Now, let's see if he understands the words my grandma taught him.
<cf>Well, I'm sure the nappo won't be much help if he gets out of line. <cf>Well, let's give it a try!
<span size="Big">......!　......, ......! </>
Strange pronunciation, right? <cf>I had a hard time with it at first too.
It's a little tricky. <cf>It's more like turn your throat over. ......
Hey, look, look, look! <cf>Nappo just spotted us!
<span size="Big">......!　............? </>
Okay, okay. <cf>Well, keep going over there.
<span size="Big">......?　......!　......! </>
<span size="Big">......?　......~♪</>
No, no! <cf> Don't come over here!
Over there. Go over there, see?
Hmmm, they're dancing like they're having a good time.
It doesn't look like they're going to attack you.
Ah!
...... I fell asleep.
I can't talk to you at all. <cf>...... let's go home.
Let's go back to where we were. <cf>I'm sorry I wasted your time. ......
Thanks for your time. <cf>It was impossible to get through to Nappo. ......
<cf>I was hoping to try it on some other monsters if it worked.
Grandma could really do it, man.
That's exactly what she did, even the goblins listened to her. <cf>I was just meekly letting them go over there.
I thought <cf>I could handle it, if I was a nappa.
But what was wrong with what you just said? <cf>I thought I told him to go over there.
Hmmm. I guess it's impossible to get rid of monsters <cf>just by word of mouth.
Huh?　What do you mean <span size="Big">the Pioneering Bureau is looking into</span> the oral traditions?
What, tell me that first!
If you're from the Pioneer Bureau, you might <cf>know</cf> a lot more than that!
Please. Please introduce me to that person! <cf>I want to know more about this oral tradition.
Did you get a request in L'Arpall? <cf>Then take me there with you as you report back!
I want to know more about this oral tradition!
<cf>Take me to the people at the <cf>Pioneering Bureau</cf> in Lalpar, while you're reporting back!
Thanks for your help, adventurer! <cf>How would you like to investigate the oral traditions of Berkmar?
Eh?　You are taking the person who passed down the oral tradition to you? <cf>Okay. We will listen to what you have to say.
<span size="Big">......!　......!　......? </>
How's ......? <cf>This is the oral word, but...
......I see. <cf>I think I understand a little.
Really?　What did that just mean? <cf> Tell me!
Oh, sorry, the meaning is a little ....... <cf>But it's pronounced like goblin or mook!
And the way they vocalize it.
Maybe the oral tradition is <cf> the language of the monster itself!
If you use it to talk to monsters,<cf> I can see why the Buffalians would consider it heretical.
Oh, come on. My grandma's not a monster, and she's not on <cf>the side of the monsters</cf>.
No, of course I understand that. <cf>Words are words, after all.
Knowing the language of monsters has nothing to do with <cf>being on their side.
Rather, we should thank <cf>grandmother</cf> for leaving us with valuable words!
Because if we use these words well, <cf>we may not have to fight the monsters!
Mr. Raboli. <cf>Would you like to work at the Pioneer Station?
I think the words you have passed down orally <cf>should be properly studied.
That's a good thing! <cf>I want to be able to use this language properly!
I want to talk to monsters like my grandma and <cf> help people!
That's settled. <cf>Thank you very much then!
Thank you so much. <cf>Thanks for making this a very useful survey.
I am glad I asked you to help me. <cf>Please continue to help the Pioneer Bureau.
Thanks for taking on such a strange request. <cf>We haven't decided on the corpse yet: ......
Actually, my friend and I were on our way to Litze when we were attacked by a <cf>monster</cf>.
<cf>I was saved by the guy who covered for me. <cf>But I don't know what happened to him. ......
Please. Please help me find my friend Yoan, the adventurer!
I wish I could find him, but I can't. ...... <cf>I don't care if it's just a clue. At least something ......
He's getting married. ...... <cf> Damn it ...... how did this happen......
Yoan's guy always wore a bandana. <cf>That fiancée complimented him on it.
The straggler was in the Montenol Valley. <cf>I think it was near the waterfall on the "Litze Trading Road".
There must be something left in that area. <cf>Please be safe ...... Joanne ......!
<cf>I think we got separated near the waterfall in the Montenegro Valley "Litze Trading Route".
I don't care if it's just a clue. At least something ......
I found a torn bandana.
I wonder if it belonged to an adventurer named Yoan. <cf>I can't find anything else that looks promising.
I'll ask Girsch to check the bandana.
Let's get the bandana to Girsch in Larpall and see if <cf> it belongs to Yoan.
Oh, it's you. <cf>What?　You found the bandana!
Let me see!
This is ...... for sure. <cf> Yoan's bandana.
The one he was wearing that day. <cf> Well, it was in a ...... waterfall. ......
Yoan wasn't there, was he? <cf>...... I knew it was a bad idea. ......
Still don't know?　Maybe. <cf>Yoan's a stubborn guy.
Yeah. ...... I'm not giving up hope. <cf> But we need to be clear.
Joan's fiancé is in Minsterhorn. <cf>I'll tell him everything and bow out.
There's no way they'll forgive me, though. ...... <cf>At least it's my responsibility to tell him properly.
Thank you. <cf>You've made me step up to the plate.
If you <cf>ever hear Yoan's name anywhere, let me know. See ya.
Haha, haha ....... <cf>I managed to escape this far: ......
Oh, but! <cf>How could they take that thing?
If we don't do this, <cf>there will be another victim of the curse......
Small items and trinkets are scattered all over the place.
It looks more like the remains of <cf>someone ransacking the place, rather than lost items......
There may be merchants who have had their belongings taken from them. <cf>If I see him, I'll deliver it to him.
Haha, haha ....... <cf>Totally, what a day!
...... Oh, that! <cf>That accessory you have!
It was stolen from me by bandits. <cf>Picked it up on the street?　Okay, thanks.
But it looks like you don't have that thing. ...... <cf>The bandits took it?
Sorry. While you're at it, <cf>I have one more favor to ask. May I?
Once again, I am Bessemer. <cf>I'm a peddler.
<cf>I was attacked by bandits on the street a while ago. <cf>They took my merchandise.
<cf>You picked it up and delivered it to me, thank God. <cf>Thank you very much.
I just ...... couldn't lose something <cf>I haven't gotten back.
It's a black box that fits in both of my hands. <cf>In it is the Necklace of the Damned.
<cf>It's a necklace with a legend that whoever holds it in their hands will suffer misfortune.
It may sound silly, but the curse is real.
I've experienced it firsthand. <cf>I've been given forgeries, I've had boats sink, and so on. ......
So I decided to dedicate <cf> the necklace to the Buffalians.
And on the way, I was attacked by bandits. <cf> Maybe this is another curse of the necklace.
Perhaps the bandits took the necklace.
Please. <cf>I need you to help me get the necklace back!
<cf>The bandits have fled in the direction of Asterlys. <cf>But they must not have left the Baha Mar Plateau yet!
<cf>I think we can find them if we look for the Hill of the Divine Watch. <cf>especially around the border with the Asterian Plains.
Let's get going right away. <cf>Before the curse of the necklace falls on someone.
The bandit who took the necklace<cf>must not have left the Bahamar Plateau yet.
I think we can find him if we <cf>look around the border between the Hill of the Divine Watch and the Asterian Plain.
Let's hurry, before the curse falls on someone else.
U...... who are you......? <cf> Isn't that the merchant from ...... beside you?
I'm sure of it. <cf>They're the bandits who attacked me and took my belongings.
But I'm so battered and ......... <cf>What the hell happened?
<cf>I found an expensive looking necklace among the loot. <cf>I was delighted that it must be a good one, and then ......
<cf>And suddenly a rumble-boat came barreling in. <cf>How did it end up here......
I knew it: ......
That necklace has a curse on it that <cf>makes whoever gets it unhappy!
Oh, you ......!　<cf>What the hell are you selling?
It's not a commodity. <cf> I was going to dedicate it to the temple.
So, where's the necklace?
<cf> It got caught in the fangs of a rumblebore and <cf> they took it.
Damn, I didn't think he was that bad. <cf>I'll give you back everything I took!　Take it!
Where's Rumblebore? <cf>He ran towards the cliff!
It's right there. He fell off the cliff. <cf>Follow him the rest of the way!
Let's hurry up and go. <cf>I hope I can get it back this time......
According to the bandits, Rumblebore should be <cf>at the bottom of the cliffs at "God's Watch Hill."
The cursed necklace is there too. <cf>Let's hurry up and go there.
This is the rumblebore that attacked the bandits, isn't it? <cf>The necklace is stuck in his fangs.
Looks like he hit this tree and <cf>died</cf>.
But did he fall off that cliff and <cf>accidentally hit this tree ......
What a horrible necklace <cf> to have misfortune befall an animal!
...... Okay, I finally recovered it. <cf>This time we'll deliver it to the Buffalians.
The temple in Asterlys is good. <cf>There, I'm sure they can purify this necklace.
The only problem is, <cf>what misfortune will happen to it before we get there. ......
You. Could I ask you to escort me a little longer? <cf>To the temple of Asterlys, please.
Can you escort me to the temple of Asterlys?
<cf>What misfortunes may befall you on the way there......
We've arrived at ......!
Thank goodness I have the cursed necklace with me. I was wondering what would happen on the way since you have the cursed necklace.
With you, strangely enough, <cf>nothing happened.
I wonder why?　Maybe you have some <cf>power</cf> that could quell the curse.
At any rate, I was able to carry it safely. <cf>Now I too will be free from the curse.
No one will be struck by misfortune anymore. <cf>I won't forget this favor. <cf>Thank you!
Now, one more step. <cf>I'll go on my own from here.
Don't worry. <cf>Nothing will happen to you now that you've come this far!
Hugyaaaaaa!
Wow, the cat that stepped on my tail attacked me!
C'aaaaah!
S-sorry, miko! <cf> A hand happened to grab my chest ......!
Where are you touching? <cf>[Insolence]!　<cf>[Insolence]!
Chi, it's not that!
Thank you for listening to me. <cf>Mr. Adventurer.
I am Tria. <cf>I was evacuated from Berkmar.
Yes, I am. It was during the <cf>Avaritia disaster.
At that time, my sister left her favorite <cf> stuffed animal behind.
That guy, he's always worried about it. ...... <cf>I've lost all my energy!
Could you please go to Bergmar and look for <cf>my sister's stuffed animal?
It is a pink Uribo stuffed animal. <cf>It's so rare, I think there's only one.
If it hadn't been for that <cf>we would still be having fun playing with it. ......
...... Oh, sorry! <cf>That's what you have to tell the adventurers.
There is a priest in Berkmahal <cf>praying for us!
He may be able to tell us <cf>more details about the village and what's left of it!
I would be grateful for your kind attention. <cf>I'd like to cheer up my sister as much as possible.
Maybe the priests of Berkmar can tell us <cf> more about what's going on in the village.
Please, please, please.
You are an adventurer, aren't you? <cf>What can I do for you in this land?
<cf>This is the place where a tragic event took place. <cf>Many have gone to sleep.
<cf>We ask that you refrain from disturbing their peace.
...... at the request of the boy who lived here? <cf>Oh, I see. I'm sorry about that.
Please forgive my rudeness. <cf>My name is Innaat, priest of Buffalia.
<cf>My mission is to pray for the peace of those who sleep in Berkmahal, <cf> and to maintain tranquility.
Still, I admire you. <cf>I am amazed that you came all the way here to find a stuffed animal.
The peace of mind of a young child is<cf> more precious than anything else.
I have an idea where the stuffed animals are.
It seems that goblins had ravaged the place before we arrived.
They may have taken the stuffed animal along with their belongings.
If you search the goblins' lair, you will find it. <cf>There is a "settlement of misfortune" in the "foothills of the calming mountains".
If you wish, you can retrieve the people's belongings as well. <cf>We will repay you accordingly.
<cf>The pink Uribo stuffed animal you are looking for may have been taken by goblins.
If you search for it in the "village of misfortune" at the foot of the Mountains of Calm, <cf>you should be able to find it.
If you wish, you may also retrieve the belongings of the people.
Amongst the jewels and precious metals, there is<cf> a pink stuffed Uribo.
We have recovered the belongings of the people of Berkmahl and the stuffed animal you <cf>requested</cf>.
Deliver the <cf> relics to the innate in Berkmahl
I have retrieved <cf> the belongings and <cf> the "pink Uribo stuffed animal".
You <cf>found</cf> the relics of the people of Berkmahl.
Wonderful. Thank you <cf>for finding good people like you.
These will be offered at the altar of mourning for those who have passed away. <cf> Hopefully, they will lead us to God.
And you mentioned that this Uribo stuffed animal <cf>still has an owner.
A boy named Tria and his sister. <cf>It's a small thing, but it will be a beacon of hope.
Please bring them back to us.
Thank you for finding these relics.
The stuffed animal Uribo was given to its owner, a boy named <cf>Tria, and his sister.
You really found it? <cf>Wow. I didn't know such a thing could happen!
Thank goodness. ...... <cf>That's his stuffed animal!
This was a gift from my parents. <cf>It's now a ...... memento, but...
Aberritya attacked us, and <cf>both of them are no longer with us.
But there are people like you who can help. <cf>I also got my memories back
It's been hard, but <cf>I'm going to live strong with my sister from now on.
Thank you so much. <cf>I will never forget this.
Ahhh~. <cf>It's a beautiful day~!
The sun is nice and the clouds are big. <cf>Why am I doing deliveries on a day like this?
Hey, it's a beautiful day~! <cf>Thanks for taking care of the delivery.
<cf>I tend to get distracted and lose sight of my surroundings.
I was looking at the clouds the other day, and I fell into the ocean with a stack of letters in my arms.
<cf>Well, I got so mad at you. <cf>Wouldn't it be a disaster if it happened again?
That's why I don't <cf>force myself to deliver on a nice day like this.
So, yes. <cf>This is the package I'm delivering.
Of course, you can <cf>get all the delivery fees.
The deliveries are all near the forwarding portal, so <cf>you're better off using the portal than walking.
Well then, nice to meet you. <cf>Ah~ it's really a beautiful day!
<cf>The first destination is near the transfer portal in the arena.
<cf>It feels so good, I'm getting sleepy!
Hey, you're late!
I've been waiting for you. This is it! <cf> Here's a newspaper with predictions for the next game!
...... Hmmm... Yes! <cf> Now I've got a big hole in my pocket, and I'm going to win big!
Thanks a lot!
Hmm?　Are you wondering where to go next? <cf> Come to think of it, you don't look familiar.
Let me see. <cf>Here you go: ......
Looks like the next stop is near the beach transfer portal. <cf>Good luck!
Ah, I've been waiting for you. Sun Oil. <cf>Thanks for delivering it!
I'll have to take care of my sunburn. <cf>You'd better be careful too.
Well then, let's go swimming. <cf>I'm going to have fun today!
Oh?　You wanted to know where the nearest portal is<cf> to your next delivery?　You're new, aren't you?
Let's see, <cf>it looks like the next closest portal is the transfer portal in front of the Temple of Buffalia.
Ahhhh ......<cf>Now, I need to apply some sun oil!
I've got a delivery for you! <cf>I've been waiting for you!
A message from the main temple of the Duchy of Barnhart, right? <cf>Ho-ho-ho!　At last I can go home!
<cf>I was sick and tired of being thrown into a temple that was only big and had no tradition or prestige.
<cf>It was worth the effort to flatter the higher-ups. <cf>Which, which, let's get right to it: ......
............ Nuh-uh? <cf>Na, na, na, what the hell?
Transferred to Litze...... in that, that, that dank place! <cf>This me!
No way!　I am a man who has risen to greatness in the main temple and will eventually become a chief priest......!
<cf>I am a man who will eventually become a chief priest......! <cf>No such ...... thing ......!
<span size="Big">No, you idiot! </>
<span size="Big">No, you idiot! <cf>So funny that you got left!
......What?　No?　You mean where you're going to make your next delivery? <cf> Hmmmmmmm......
I can't help it, I'm not in the mood. ......<cf>It's like I'm the new guy. Special.
Looks like the next delivery will be near the transfer portal at Celestial Crest Plaza.
............ huh. ...... left. <cf>No, I won't lose!　I won't lose!
Oh, Mr. Deliveryman. <cf> We've been expecting you.
Oh, yes, this envelope. <cf>Thank you for delivering it.
<cf>This is a boarding ticket for a liner. <cf>I accidentally left it at home.
<cf>I left it at home by accident, and in my haste I had my daughter send it to me. <cf>I'm glad I got it in time.
Did you know?　<cf>There are regular boat trips from Asterleaze to the various regions.
<cf>It's nice and relaxing to take a boat trip. <cf>If you ever get the chance, you should try it!
Have a nice trip, then.
Oh?　Having trouble finding a place to deliver? <cf>Asterlys is a big place.
Let's see. ......<cf> The portal to the "Spinning Wheel Pavilion" seems to be close by.
Have a nice trip.
You're the delivery guy. <cf>Thank you very much.
<cf>Sorry about the large baggage. <cf>I was so busy stocking up on groceries.
<cf>Asterlys has everything you need, vegetables, meat, fish, etc.<cf> Especially seafood!
<cf>The seafood is especially fresh and delicious! <cf>The harbor market is worth a visit!
Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I just stood there and chatted. <cf>I'd better get started on my preparations.
Stop by my store if you get hungry!
Oh, hey. What's up?　Where's your next delivery? <cf> Oh, you must be lost.
It's addressed like this: ......<cf> Looks like it's around the portal at Asterlys Port.
Good luck with your work too!
Oh, the letter ......! <cf>I'm glad, thanks!
I've been waiting for it for a long time. ...... <cf>Good. I'm glad you got it.
<cf>My boyfriend is an adventurer, <cf>and he's on a continent across the ocean right now.
It's so far away that <cf>it takes days for the letter to reach me.
And, of course, he'll write back. <cf>I just have to wait and hope he's okay.
It would be <cf>best</cf> if he actually came home. ......
Oh, I'm sorry. You went to the trouble of delivering it to me. <cf>Thank you. I'll read it with care.
Yes?　Oh, you're looking for a delivery address. <cf>The next delivery address seems to be near the Coin Pavilion.
Use the forwarding portal, it's faster. <cf>Get it to the person who's waiting for it as soon as possible.
Hmm?　A letter for me? <cf>That's unusual.
Who might it be from? <cf>...... From my son and his wife.
They contact me like this from time to time. <cf>Thank goodness for old people.
<cf>I'll have to prepare a reply. <cf>I'll have to ask Lindsay to write for me again.
You take care of your family, too. <cf>A single letter would be nice.
<cf>No, thank you. <cf>Oh, by the way, you're not always here, Helit.
She's been entrusted with the delivery. That must have been hard work.
<cf>Why don't you go and complain to her about it?
<cf>Hey, good job! <cf>You got them all.
Thank you very much. <cf>As promised, the delivery fee is yours. Yes, sir.
Isn't a forwarding portal handy? <cf>It's a quick way to travel far away.
They're also used outside of Asterlys, so <cf>you can look for them everywhere you go.
Use it well and save time. <cf>But be careful not to get lost!
Well, I'll see you later. I'm going home. <cf>I got sleepy looking at the sky.
<cf>I don't feel like working tomorrow. <cf>This doesn't make me feel like working tomorrow~~.
<cf>It smells so good. <cf>It really smells delicious.
But I can't eat it very well....... <cf>Still, I can't stop eating it......
But, but...... oh no! <cf>I can't be very brave
<span size="Big">Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! </>
Mi, mi ...... water, ......! <cf>Water, give me some! ......
Oh, water, the root of all cooking......! <cf>I had forgotten how precious it is......
Is that taste to <cf>remind people of the greatness of water......?
The fainted cook seems <cf> to have been wigged into a doctor's chair.
He kept repeating ["]water, water ["]"] like a gibberish. <cf>What on earth did he say? ......
Hey, hey, I have a super efficient diet! <cf>Did you know?
Eat spicy food and sweat! <cf>How great would it be to lose weight while tasting so good?
Hmmm......... But you know what? <cf>I can't stop sweating cold sweat since a while ago.
I'm fine with spicy food! <cf>......, I thought.
<cf>The woman who fainted seems to have been rushed to the doctor.
She was sweating so much that her face turned blue. <cf>What in the world did she say? ......
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! <cf>We're going to keep the peace in the city today!
<cf>This is a good place to eat, tasty and cheap! <cf>I always get fired up when I eat here........................!
I'm a little bit too much! <cf>I'm on fire today!
My body is so hot that I'm burning up--!
<span size="Big">Ugh, goof! </>
The unconscious soldier seems to have been <cf>wigged over to the doctor.
He was too excited to keep his eyes open. <cf>What in the world did he say? ......
You're an adventurer, right? <cf>I have a favor to ask you.
Actually, I fell in love at first sight with a lady. ...... <cf>I'd like to get close to her somehow.
But there's something I really <cf>have</cf> to do to make that happen!
Oh, thanks for taking me on!
Her name is Aleni. She's the owner of the restaurant there. <cf> She's also a chef famous for her hot and spicy food.
Here, listen carefully. <cf>I can hear the voices of people who have eaten her food.
Oh, anggyaaaaahhhh! <cf> Spicy, too spicy!
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii！！！！ <cf>But I can't stop eating!
...... That's the cry of a customer. <cf>It's hard to believe they are eating food, isn't it?
What?　You said it looks like the people in town ate it, too? <cf>And they all passed out? ......
That's right. If I want to get close to Aleni, <cf>I have to be able to eat her food.
But I don't like spicy food. <cf>I can't even put it in my mouth.
Then I heard a rumor. <cf>I heard a rumor that there is a medicine that can make you not feel any kind of spiciness!
<cf>But it seems to be a medicine for adventurers, and they won't sell it to ordinary people like me.
<cf>Please. Please go and buy the medicine for me.
<cf>I'm sure a medicine man named Danae in Minsterhorn makes that medicine.
Of course I'll pay for it. <cf>I'll be waiting for you. I'm asking you!
The medicine to make you feel less spicy should be made by a medicine man named <cf>Danae</cf> in Minsterhorn!
I'll pay the price, I asked him!
Welcome, adventurers. <cf>You need a potion?
A potion to make you feel less spicy? <cf>Yes, we have it. Please wait.
This way, please. <cf>Please eat "Mean Jelly" with this medicine.
<cf>The ingredients of the medicine will act on your sense of taste and you will not feel the spiciness.
If you are sensitive to spiciness, please increase the amount of jelly. <cf> Five "Mean Jelly". I think this will be fine.
Just to be sure, <cf>what kind of usage do you have in mind?
It's dangerous if you use it in a way we don't expect, <cf>so we check when we sell you the medicine.
...... I see. I'll take Mr. Areni's dish.
We are aware of Mr. Areni's very spicy dishes. <cf> This is not the first time I have ordered something like this.
However, even if you take this medicine ......
No, it is not for me to say any more. <cf>There is no problem with the dosage. Please take it.
You can get "Mean Jelly" from <cf>Mean's Nest in "Dawn Bug Fort, Additional Research". Please be careful.
It was Mr. Bosch who asked for medicine, wasn't it? Please deliver them to him along with <cf>"Mean Jelly.
You can get <cf>"Mean Jelly" by defeating the nest of meen in "Dawn Bug Fort, Additional Investigation". Take care!
This is the medicine that makes you feel less spicy! <cf>Thank you, how can I thank you?
With this, even very spicy food is nothing. <cf>I can talk to Areni!
I'll take it and go into the restaurant right away! <cf>Oh, I'm so nervous!
Huh. ......
Oh, you ....... <cf>Will you listen to me?
I could eat Aleni's food. <cf>I could eat it, but ......
I didn't find it tasty at all.
I took one bite and immediately understood. <cf> Her food tastes good because it's spicy.
That's the best part. <cf>That's why everyone was so crazy about her cooking.
I didn't even understand that.
<cf>I ruined the taste of someone I loved's food because I was so desperate to eat it.
I cheated, so I guess I got the bee's knees. <cf>I couldn't even look her in the eye.
I'm sorry you went to the trouble of helping me. <cf>But it made me realize something important.
Next time, I'll train my palate properly<cf>and tell her from the bottom of my heart that it was ["]delicious["].
<cf>Thank you very much. <cf>Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Adventurer! <cf>I need your help with my chickens!
I brought my chickens from Minsterhorn to sell here at the market.
But when I took my eyes off them, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>they attacked me!
And all those chickens <cf>had to run away!
Please! <cf>Save my chickens!
Oh, Anne and Alice and Bonnie and Victoria, <cf>Where have they gone? ......
What?　Anyone else want to help? <cf> No, there's no one else.
Now that's a chicken's name. <cf>It's only right that we give it a proper name.
That's right!　<cf> I told them to go home if anything happened to them.
<cf>I'm going back to Minsterhorn! <cf>Maybe some of them are back home!
I want adventurers to come, too. <cf>If you see them on the road, please let me know.
Oh, my Anne, Bonnie, and Victoria: ......
I'm going back to Minsterhorn first, but <cf>I'd like you adventurers to come too!　Please.
Well, adventurer, you're here. <cf>Nobody came back to the chicken coop!
<cf> I guess the adventurers didn't get anything either. <cf>This is a messy situation!
I bet those kids are still <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/> being chased around in <cf>their own territory!
Adventurer. <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> and rescue them!
As a matter of fact, a cheerful girl named Elsie was listening to me just now.
She shouted, "[Don't let Landfox the! [She just ran off screaming, "Landfox the Unforgivable!
<cf>I want you to save that girl, too. <cf>I'm sure she's scared, surrounded by monsters.
A girl named Elsie was yelling <cf>Don't let Landfox the! [!"] and ran off.
<cf>[Landfox the Unforgivable! <cf>She can't have gone that far.
She needs our help, too.
Oh, adventurer! <cf>Maybe Mr. Machey sent you?
You know him, don't you?　<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> has bullied Mr. Chicken!
I can't believe he was going to bite off such a cute and tasty chicken without <cf>snatching</cf> it!
You don't even know how to lose a head,...... how to skin a chicken,......<cf>or how to drain its blood!
No mercy from the Buffalo Gods!
<span size="Big">Landfox the, don't forgive me! </>
Let's split up and take them down! <cf>If each of us kills 20 of them, the chickens will be safe!
What?　Yes, I'll go and defeat them too. <cf>It'll be a piece of cake considering Mr. Chicken!
<cf>We'll meet back here when you're done. <cf>So, here we go!　It's all for Mr. Chicken!
Beasts that have never been kept by man! <cf>You should be aware of the difference in the weight of meat!
If we kill <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> around here <cf>20 of them each, the chickens will be safe!
We'll meet back here when you're done!
Thanks for your hard work, adventurer! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>You have defeated them!
It's perfect on my part, too. <cf>Dangerous?　No, nothing dangerous happened.
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>When I think of the chicken, it was nothing more than a small slice of meat!
We were able to save the chickens safely! <cf>Thanks to the adventurers. <cf>Thank you very much.
It's all right now, chicken. <cf>I know it was scary being chased.
<cf>They were violent people who didn't know how to handle a chicken, and we defeated them.
<cf>I will cut off your heads cleanly without any pain!
Ha!　I shouldn't, I shouldn't. <cf>I was just getting ahead of myself!
<cf>These chickens look so healthy and shiny!
I'm sure they were raised with a lot of love. <cf>So nice!　They look delicious!
Now, let's go back and give them back to <cf>Macey</cf>!
Oh, those wonderful chickens! <cf>I want to eat them!
Let's <cf> give them back to Mr. Machey of Minsterhorn!
Oh, you guys! <cf>Wow, I'm glad to hear you're all right!
Thank you, adventurers! <cf>You are our benefactor!
<cf>Thanks to you too, little girl. <cf>Heaven is not what it seems!
<cf>You're a fine adventurer for such a pretty face. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
No, I'm not!　I am a butcher! <cf>I am not an adventurer!
Why does everyone treat me like an <cf>adventurer</cf> every time they see me?
[I want you to help me to defeat the monsters! [I'm not an adventurer! ["]"] and so on.

<cf>Are you afraid to fight with monsters? <cf>I don't want to do that!
Is that so? <cf>Well, don't be modest.
This is for you. Thank you. <cf>Well, adventurers, if you ever need help again, we'll be happy to help.
That's not why I'm here! <cf>I'm not an adventurer!
Huovi's guy~~! <cf> Don't get all worked up just because you're a regular employee. ......
I'm going to finish my assignments and graduate from <cf>apprentice</cf>!
Hello, adventurer. <cf>How is Enhance Imagine working for you?
Today I have a favor to ask of you <cf>adventurers</cf> regarding Battle Imagine!
I have an upcoming assignment from the institute.
A training assignment to explain Battle Imagine, and a practical assignment to <cf>actually craft the Imagine.
I'd like to review it before we go live, so <cf>Would you mind keeping me company for a bit, adventurer?
Okay, first we'll start with the training.
As I'm sure you've used many times before, <cf>Battle Imagine</cf> is a great aid in combat.
Like weapons, they can be crafted from <cf>materials</cf>.
Check out the recipe for the Imagine you're looking for. Use your <cf>wishlist</cf> to your advantage!
And there is one <cf>essential</cf> ingredient for crafting Battle Imagines.
That is "Idea."
It is the core of the Battle Imagine, <cf>a small crystal that combines engrams with intentions, memories, and the movements of the mind.
Ideas can be found in a variety of places, but most often they are obtained by killing monsters.
Once you have all the materials you need, go to the Imagine Laboratory counter and ask for <cf>crafting</cf>.
If you do, you will get a Battle Imagine! <cf>Then you can use it to your heart's content!
Fuu....... <cf>So that's about it for the training.
Now for the practical. <cf>I'll have to do the actual crafting on my own.
<cf>I want to get a good look at the actual Battle Imagine <cf>before I do it</cf>.
So, adventurer. Would you <cf>please show me the "B-Pink Uribo"?
I don't care if you crafted it, found it in a treasure chest, or <cf> any other way you got it.
Help me to pass!　Please!
Get the "B-Pink Uribo" and <cf>show it to me!
I want to make sure <cf>I get a good look at the real thing before I do the practical assignment.
I don't care if you craft it, find it in a treasure chest, or<cf>any other way, please!
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Did you get "B-Pink Uribo"?
Oh, you got it right. <cf>So, let me take a look at it.
Let's see. ...... Hmm, I see. <cf>Here's what it looks like: ......
Wow, so much engram....... <cf>Hey?　This one is different from what I expected......
Wow, I'm glad I saw it after all! <cf>Thanks, adventurer!
That was soooo helpful. <cf>I guess all I have to do now is to do the rest on my own.
Oh, yeah!　Don't forget that Battle Imagines have <cf>abilities too!
Even if they are the same type of Battle Imagine, the <cf>Abilities may have different effects.
I recommend that you find the Imagine that suits you best and use it!
<cf>Thanks for your Imagine and good luck on your adventures. <cf>Come to the institute anytime if you need anything.
Someday I'll become a regular staff member, and <cf>I'll repay you, adventurers!
Hello, adventurer. <cf>How's Imagine?　Is it helping you?
Craft more and more, and try using different kinds of Imagine!
Good day, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your help the other day.
<cf>My life-size doll that I prepared for you. <cf>I was going to present it to Mr. Huovi. ......
["]You know, Reichin. <cf>Weapon crafting is super☆good, isn't it? ["]]
["]Will you make one for me, too?  ["]]
[That's what he said.
I have been crafting <cf>weapons</cf> without a wink of sleep since then!
I am in awe of such a thing as one. <cf>I will craft a thousand or ten thousand!
But, Huovi, you can craft <cf>[just] the best one. It's not easy for you either, is it?
What kind words of encouragement she gave me: ......! <cf>Wow, I'm ...... I'm ......!
<span size="Big">Haaaaan! </>
[--]But we've discovered the problem. <cf>We are running out of materials for weapons!
I can't stop crafting, and I have no choice but to ask ......<cf>adventurers for help.
The material needed is "Pareidolite". <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" should get it.
With this, I will craft a full-body swing for <cf>Huovi-sama!
If you can't collect the materials, <cf>I will ...... my ......!
[--]Please, I would appreciate it. Dear Adventurer.
I would appreciate it if you could <cf>collect</cf> the Pareidolite in <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>.
If you don't collect them, I <cf>will be ......<cf> me ......!　Hahhhhhh!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. Thank you. ...... <cf>You have collected the "Pareidolite"!
With this, you can craft a weapon to present to Master Huovi.
Once the crafting is finished, we must proceed with the <cf>"plug installation"!
Weapons have <cf>"sockets" for attaching "ability plugs".
These are used to give the weapon abilities. <cf>That is what "plug attachment" is.
<cf>Adventurers are welcome to try it out as well, since it can be done by asking a "weapon modifier".
Oh, yes, I'll give you this one.
This is an "Ability Plug Removal Ticket. <cf>This is used to remove unwanted abilities.
If the socket is full, <cf>new abilities cannot be given!
In such a case, we remove the ability.
It is as if <cf>we are removing the insects that are clinging to Huovi!
[I've never been so glad to have learned about weapons as I was then.
Now, I must ask you to pick up the <cf>weapon</cf> that I have poured my heart and soul into!
Embrace it so much that it breaks your bones ......! <cf>Make me kiss you so hard that you choke ......!
My weapon, <cf>messed up so much that not even a trace of my face is left,<cf>......!
[--]Thank you very much. <cf>So long, adventurer. Have a good day.
Good day, Mr. Adventurer.
How do you like your weapons plugged in? <cf>Please try it not once, but many times!
<cf>I would be happy if we could get you as close as possible to your ideal weapon.
A poster for the Astelleries Guard <cf>recruiting members.
<cf>"Let's protect Asterlys together! <cf> Recruitment for the Hope for Tomorrow Guard!"
<cf> Rough letters fill in over the words ......
<span size="Big">"Now that you've seen this, you're a member!" </>
<span size="Big">"The reply is ["]Yes! You can only reply ["]or ["]oh! ["]!"]! </>
<cf>"If you have a problem with me, come and get it! <cf> "I'm looking for people with spirit, guts and ability!
</>"I'm at the arena! <cf> To Platoon Leader Eubank of the Security Forces!
[--] I can feel the intense heat coming from here.
If you're interested in joining the Guard, <cf> visit Eubank near the arena!
Oh, what the hell! <cf>I'm Eubank, platoon leader of the Guard!
Have you seen the posters for the ...... Guard? <cf> Yeah, right!　Cool blurb, huh?
That means you're going to be a member of the squad, right? <cf>The answer is ["]yes! You can only reply ["] or ["]oh! ["]] only!
Hm......? <cf>How ...... you're pretty good.
I'd say you're pretty good. <cf>My arms are tingling after a long time. ......
<cf>........!　Sorry, sorry. <cf>I'm getting into old habits.
I used to be a gladiator in the arena. <cf>I get turned on when I see a strong guy.
I thought there were some real tough guys in the guard. <cf>Listen to me. I'm pathetic.
<cf>I've decided to have you guys take on some monster-killing as part of the guard training.
<cf>and pick up some good stuff along the way.
But the higher-ups got all upset. <cf>[I can't allow such a dangerous training...]]
<cf>["]There's no reason why this stuff should be dangerous! [<cf> I told them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
No matter how much they want to do it, they can't move unless they get permission.
And that's where you come in. <cf>Clean up the training I've devised.
<cf>If someone actually does it, the higher-ups will have no choice but to shut up,<cf> right?
It might be boring for you, though. <cf>All you have to do is give me a little nudge.
<cf>The training is to collect materials for "additional investigation of the claw marks of the giant dragon. <cf>Then, I'm counting on you!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_03_01_02001"/>So go to "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon: Additional Research" and kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_03_01_02001"/>.
Collect the "blackened fangs" they drop, <cf>that's my idea of training.
I'm counting on you!
Oh, good job! <cf> Looks like the training menu went well.
That was easy, wasn't it?　There you go. <cf>They who can do it, can do it.
They're all making a big deal about it when they haven't even tried it.
I mean, that's the thing, isn't it? <cf>You're an adventurer, too, right?
That means that as far as training for the security force goes, it's rather lukewarm, isn't it?
That's right!　Okay, I've decided! <cf>Let's raise the difficulty a couple more levels!
Double the number of people to take down. <cf>No portals allowed. Just run.
We'll have them get food from the local market. <cf>Fill the empty bag with rocks.
All right, all right. <cf>This is going to be good training!
Thanks!　Thanks to you, <cf>I'll be able to train my men hard.
See you later. <cf>Next time we have time, let's have a game!
Adventurer!　Thank you. <cf>You're going to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>!
We're on a pilgrimage to the holy land of the Buffalians. <cf>But we can't get through the streets because of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>.
I can't go any further from Larpal.
This is the place to be, okay? <cf>"Kamikake no Omashira" is right there.
I can pray every day, <cf>so I feel a little bit better off.
But you know what? I'll get bored <cf> if it goes on like this for days on end.
Besides, I can't wait to go to Salamzat! <cf>My cousin lives there.
<cf>Whenever I go there on pilgrimage, we always make plans to play. <cf>I better hurry up or I won't have time to play!
My mom and dad say it's God's will, but I can't take it anymore!
I can't take it anymore! <cf>Adventurers, please!　Kill the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>!
Be careful out there. <cf> May the God of Buffalia bless you!
It's the '<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>' that's preventing you from making the pilgrimage. <cf> They are stronger monsters than just mooks.
Dad said the location is "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>".
It's not easy for normal people to defeat it, <cf>so we've been waiting for an adventurer who can take care of it.
Please!　I won't have time to play with my cousin Salamzaat.
Go defeat him quickly!
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>Thank you very much!
Now we can go to the Montenol Valley. <cf>Salamuzat is much further away, though.
Everyone was so glad you guys could continue your pilgrimage.
Ah, yes. The priest thanked me too. <cf>Yes. I gave it to him.
<cf> Well, I'm off, my dad and the boys are calling for me. <cf>Thank you so much!
Thank you, God of Buffalia. <cf>Give us adventurers your blessings, too!
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for asking for my advice.
I'm Einar, an actor. I'm still a rookie. <cf>I came out here from Litze the other day.
I was thinking about taking over the family business,......<cf> but I just couldn't give up my dream of being an actor.
Fortunately, the arts are thriving in Asterleaze. <cf>The director liked me too.
So, I'm going on stage for the first time, and<cf>I have to dance.
I don't know much about urban music. <cf>The rhythm and tempo are unique.
and on top of that, I have to choreograph it. <cf>I'm getting so confused!
<cf>I was hoping someone could show me how to do it. <cf>I don't have any friends to ask yet.
I'm sorry if this is a strange request, but <cf>could you show me how to "dance" in front of you?
I want to learn how to dance. <cf>Could you show me how you "dance" in front of me?
<span size="Big">Amazing! </>
I see. ...... I see! <cf>I feel like I'm waking up.
<cf>I was only concerned about rhythm, steps, and form. <cf>But no. It's not like that.
I enjoyed your dance! <cf>You made my heart sing just by looking at you.
<cf>That's what's more important than getting the shape right. <cf>Dancing like you were having fun and entertaining the people watching you.
<cf>I could see it clearly when I saw you dance. <cf>You had a great smile, of course!
It was a really good dance. <cf>Why don't we all dance together?
Maybe on a street corner, or on a stage. <cf>Maybe it would be fun to dance on rooftops!
Thanks a lot! <cf>You paved the way for me.
I'll make my own dance too. <cf>I'm sure it will be a good stage!
Mr. Adventurer!　I want to be reborn!
<span size="Big">Please lend me your strength! </>
Wow!　I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ...... <cf>I'm sorry for suddenly speaking up so loudly: ......
I'm very shy and ....... <cf>I want to be reborn as a new me through esthetics!
Do you know about esthetic salons?　Esthetic salons. <cf>You can change your hair and face as you like!
Not only that, but you can also adjust your body shape and voice <cf>to your liking.
If I get an esthetic treatment, I <cf>could</cf> restart my life with a new feeling. ......
Well, so, you see... ....... <cf>I have something I want you adventurers to get.
Five "Land Fox Silver Hair" and <cf>five "Double Fangs of Uribo"......
Eh?　You're asking me if I <cf>need</cf> those things to go to an esthetic salon?
No, um, no. ...... <cf>This is the material for the outfit you want to wear after the esthetic salon......
If you want to use the esthetic salon,<cf>you only need a ticket for that!
In return for this request, <cf>we will give you a ticket to the esthetic salon, as a gift. ......
Please <cf>deliver the materials to our designer, Thierry!
Well then,......<span size="Big">I'm off to the esthetic salon! </>
<span size="Big">Thank you! </>
Wow!　<cf>I'm suddenly shouting loudly again......
The materials for the costume are ......
Five "Landfox Silver Hair" and five <cf>"Double Fangs of Uribo".
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/>" <value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/> and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00 E006_00_00_01001"/> and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>!
When you have collected them, please <cf>deliver them to the designer, Mr. Thierry!
<span size="Big">Please do! </>
Yes, welcome. <cf>You need a costume?　Please, take a look.
Oh. You have a delivery for me? <cf> Oh, you must be Noah. I've heard about you.
<cf>I've received a letter and a detailed order form from you, asking me to get you an outfit that will make you feel confident.
'Land Fox Silver Hair' and 'Double Fangs of Uribo'. <cf>Yes. The materials are exactly what was on the order form.
<cf>Yes, I'll take care of it! <cf>Wait a minute, I'll have it tailored right away.
Here you go. <cf>Here's the best outfit I've ever made!
How do you like it?　Stylish men's fashion! <cf>I think I drew some cool lines myself!
<cf>I think I've drawn some really cool lines! <cf>I'm sure they'll look back when they see me on the street!
Hmmm, it's me after all!　That's me! <cf>I think it's time for me to start thinking seriously about becoming independent.
Oh, no?　What's wrong with men?
...... Noah, are you a woman? <cf>No, no, no, no, that can't be right.
The order form definitely calls for men's costumes. <cf>There's no way they could have made a mistake.
The chest and waist are also sized for men. ...... <cf>I wonder if that's okay?　I'm a little nervous.
Anyway, take it to Noah. <cf>Are you getting a beauty treatment?　If so, she should be done by now.
If I'm wrong, I'll fix it. <cf>Please do!
It's almost time for Noah to finish his beauty treatment. <cf>Take the outfit to Noah.
If it's the wrong size, I'll fix it!
Oh, thank you, adventurer. <cf>You got me my costume.
Oh, what's wrong? <cf>Ya, it's Noah who requested it from you!
Hmph, were you surprised? <cf>This is the reborn, new me!
It's like you even changed your gender? <cf>Hmmm... ...... Well, what do you think?
If you are interested, adventurers can experience it too!
Oh, that's right. Before I forget, here you go. <cf>Tickets for the esthetic salon!
By the way, if you want to try it out, you can have an esthetic experience without a <cf> ticket!
New hairstyles and makeup are also available, so <cf>you can look more free and unique!
<span size="Big">Yes!　Just like I am now! </>
Huh?　Why did I change so much?
Whenever I look in the mirror, my ideal figure is there ....... <cf> Isn't that the happiest thing ever!
Hmph, I'm too beautiful ....... <cf>We'll be together from now on: ......
Now I'm going to go change into my new outfit and <cf>look at every inch of my body in the mirror!
May you too <cf>beauty and confidence at the beauty salon!
Adventurer, good point! <cf>Please help me!
This is a coloring store. <cf>This is a store where you can change the color of your costume!
Just by changing the color of your costume, you can completely change your impression!
You can dye it pretty!　Or you can go for a cool look! <cf>You can freely enjoy fashion to your liking!
The forefront of fashion in town! <cf>Newly opened coloring store!
It was supposed to be ......
I can't believe I never received the all-important color samples! <cf>It's almost time to open the store!
So, we need you to collect <cf>dye materials for us to make samples!
Three 'Safflare flowers' and one '[blue bell stone]'. <cf>Both can be found at "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>".
I'll take that one for now! <cf>In the meantime, I will proceed with the preparations for the opening of the store.
It's up to you adventurers to open the store! <cf>Thank you for your cooperation!
<cf>I will need three "Sufflower flowers" and one "[blue bell stone]" to make dye samples.
Both can be found at "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>".
The opening of the store is up to you, adventurers!
You have gathered the materials, haven't you? <cf>Thank you!
Yes, "Safrea Flower" and "[blue bell stone]". <cf>Now I can manage the red and blue samples!
I also need some green, but <cf>I see why I can't reach this one!
The wagon was attacked by a monster at "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" and <cf>the package was taken by <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>!
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>Can you please return the "Green Dye Sample"?
<cf>It would be quicker than if you had to gather new materials.
If you punish <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/>, he will leave it behind. <cf>Please feel free to punish him!
Given where the wagons were attacked: ......
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> should be there with the luggage at "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>"!
Please defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_00_01001"/> and get back <cf>"Green Dye Sample"!
Thank you! We now have <cf>"Green Dye Samples"!
If we can collect the dye so deftly, <cf>we might be able to open a store for adventurers!
Since we're here, let me <cf>explain the coloring process</cf>.
The first thing you need is "coloring dye. <cf>These are separated by color.
The number of colors and number of dyes required will vary depending on the costume. <cf>Check the colors and make a note of them!
If you have a favorite color, <cf>I recommend you collect a lot of them!
Also, please note that some costumes <cf>cannot</cf> be dyed!
Don't forget to check there as well!
You can <cf> restore the color of a costume to its original state by using a "dye reducer"!
If you make a mistake in dyeing, or if you want to restore the <cf>color,</cf> you can use it!
On the other hand, you can dye as much as you can to get back to the original color!
I'm looking forward to seeing your colorful coordination! <cf>I'm looking forward to it too!
Well then, now that we're all ready to go: ......
Thank you for waiting!　The cutting edge of fashion in town! <cf>The coloring store is now open!
<span size="Big">Welcome! </>
Hah, Mr. Huovi. ....... <cf>I wish to be one with you ......
I adore you. I adore you to the marrow of my bones....... <cf>No, I want to be the marrow of your bones!
Hahhhhhh! <cf>I'll be out of my mind!
Good day, adventurer. <cf>I know you well.
You are a friend of Huovi's, aren't you?
My name is Rainy. <cf>I am engaged in weapons research at the Imagine Institute.
I am a colleague of Master Huovi's, and I have a deep and abiding admiration for him.
The love that is gushing out of her like a geyser is so strong that it is threatening to burst her<cf>heart at any moment,......!
If you stare at me like that, Master Huovi,<cf>I ...... will be able to see you!
[I'm afraid I'm going to lose my mind!
So, in order to calm my heart, I decided to give <cf>Master Huovi a gift!
I thought I would give you a life-size doll of myself, and let you do with it as you please.
Yes, as you like ...... as you like! <cf>Make a mess of me, Master Huovi!
[--]Adventurer, please, I beg you. <cf>Would you please collect the materials for the gift?
What is missing is "Giant Dragon's Twin Tailbone". <cf>It is a material that can only be found in a limited number of places.
You should be able to get it <cf>by going through the <value type="locationName" id="dng009"/>.
You can't find it <cf> by searching for it like other materials, so please be careful!
If you can't get the "Giant Dragon's Twin Tailbone", <cf>I ...... I ......!
[--]Thank you very much. <cf>We are continuing to work on the dolls.
<cf>I am continuing to make dolls, and I should be able to get <cf>"The Giant Dragon's Twin Tailbone" by stepping on <value type="locationName" id="dng009"/>.
I am continuing to work on the doll, so <cf>please bring it here</cf>.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>"The Two Tailed Bone of the Giant Dragon", I have indeed received it.
You are very strong. <cf> I am very impressed with your skill, sir.
<cf>When you go through the dungeon, including the "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon,"<cf> you can obtain special materials that are exclusive to that dungeon.
They are often used to craft weapons.
It would be a good idea to be aware of both weapon crafting and dungeon crawling as a set.
Now that you have the materials for my life-size doll, don<cf>t forget to write them down. <cf>I must remember to write it down.
Oh, this one? <cf>This is a wish list.
<cf>The wish list is a convenient way to collect materials for weapons and imagines.
If you register a recipe here, you can see how many materials you have collected.
It must be tiring to count all the ingredients over and over again while adventuring, isn't it?
With the Wish List, you can see it all at a glance!
We also recommend that you register powerful weapons and Imagines, and make them <cf>a goal of your adventures</cf>.
Of course, don't worry, your wishlist will <cf>automatically update</cf>.
What?　The contents of my wish list?
Of course, it's everything related to Mr. Huovi! <cf>There is nothing else I want but her!
At first glance, the list is filled with Huovi's name. <cf>Ah ...... bliss!
Such a useful wish list. <cf>The wish list, in Huovi's words, is a wish list!
I hope you will make use of this wonderful Huovish list, <cf>adventurers!
Someday, when the list is filled up,......<cf>Huovi-sama, I ...... will be able to make the most of it!
[--]Just the thought of it makes my heart <cf>run wildly!
Dear Adventurer. <cf>Please continue to be a good friend to me, Mr. Huovi.
I will be watching you from the shadows. <cf>Huovi......Huovi......
Good day to you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Are you using your wish list?
If you have any concerns,<cf> please do not hesitate to let me know!
I am a friend of yours, Mr. Huovi. <cf>I will do my best to help you!
I'm in trouble...... I can't just throw that stone away......
But it's ...... dangerous to go get it!
I'm ...... glad you're taking care of it and ...... helping me. <cf>I don't think I can ...... handle it on my own.
I'm a stud ....... I'm on a journey to collect rocks. <cf>[collector(s)]......, if you will.
I travel around and pick up ......<cf>valuable stones......
But on the way to Minsterhorn, I was attacked ......<cf>by a monster.
I unintentionally ......<cf>threw a "valuable stone" at him, and while he was scared,......<cf> he ran away,......
That was ...... a good stone. <cf>It's one of ...... the best bargains on a long journey.
I'd like to go back and pick it up again,......<cf> but there's no end to it,...... if I get attacked again.
I'm sorry,......<cf>but instead,......<cf>I need you to pick up a "valuable stone" for me.
The place is a bit far......away....... <cf>Mount Imagine makes it ...... easier!
Mount Imagine...... understand? <cf>It's a vehicle type Imagine......
If you use it, you can travel ...... much faster than on foot. <cf>It's always convenient to take it out and ...... it's always convenient to take it out and ...... it's always convenient to take it out and ......
It will surely be useful for adventurers....... <cf>It makes travel so much smoother and ...... more enjoyable!
But I prefer the ...... stone.
The charm of that stone ...... was irreplaceable. <cf>Maybe ...... the monsters will like it too!
Please ...... before someone notices and takes it away.
If you look at the map,......<cf> you'll be able to see ...... roughly where it is. ......
This is no ordinary stone. ...... <cf>I've asked ...... for a 'valuable stone'!
How's that working out for you ......? <cf>Did you find ...... the "valuable stone"?
It's a little ...... far away ....... <cf>I recommend ...... using Mount Imagine. ......
I was so desperate that I don't remember the ...... detailed location, but <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>"...... somewhere.
Nice to meet you ...... I'm asking you.
This is ...... the stone I threw. <cf>'Worthy stone'. ...... thank you.
This stone is neither ...... a rare ore nor a gem. <cf>It won't be worth ...... money when I sell it.
But this stone has a ......<cf>value that cannot be replaced......<cf>with gold!
The size......of this size......the rugged roughness of the surface....... <cf>The color and placement are ...... truly exquisite!
And ...... you know what I mean? <cf>This vertical crack...... is it!
It's like a scar of ...... honor on the body of a man who has fought many battles.
Don't you ...... understand?　...... I see. <cf>I'm sorry,...... but that's a normal reaction,......
It's okay ...... I'm used to it. <cf>This is also the [collector's]...... fate of the [collector]!
Oh, by the way, have you tried using ...... Mount Imagine?
That's something you can ride ......<cf> in the city, not just in the field.
If you dash, you can get ...... quite a bit of ...... speed out of it!
It does consume stamina, though,....... <cf>It should also ...... recover over time.
When I go far away, it's ...... much faster ...... than walking. ......
I walk ...... to make sure I don't miss any ...... stones, but <cf>adventurers would find ...... mounts useful... ...
I hear there are ...... many different kinds. <cf>Mount Imagine's [collector] could be ...... interesting.
If you use a mount that stands out,......<cf>you'll surely become ......popular!
Not ...... like a stone collector.
It's okay ...... for me, as long as I have stones ....... <cf>You'll enjoy ...... your mounts and adventures .......
Thanks for the rocks ....... <cf>If you need anything else, please ...... me then.
Where's your next destination ......? <cf>If it's far away, you can use ...... mounts.
It will be ......<cf>better for ...... mounts if you use them!
We are currently preparing to open. <cf>Please wait a little longer.
Actually, I have a feeling that we are in a bit of trouble ......
We may ask for a request from the pioneering bureau later. <cf>We would appreciate your confirmation!
Welcome, welcome! <cf>This is a memory stand.
You're out of luck, customer! <cf>The store isn't open yet.
Patty. Watch your language? <cf>I told you you're a great clerk too.
Oh, uh, ......
O, we're not open yet, you know?
Excuse me, Mr. Adventurer. <cf> She's new here, and she's still practicing her customer service skills.
Let me explain our services to you.
At the memory stand, we offer drinks that <cf>temporarily enhance</cf> your abilities!
The "Liquid Memory" is what we use for that. <cf>This is the liquid of Buffalia's heritage.
It has the property of storing the customer's experiences and memories, and <cf>gradually activating them.
And when you drink the activated liquid memory, <cf>you will receive various benefits!
For example, the efficiency of collecting materials is increased, <cf>weapon crafting becomes a little cheaper, and so on.
All of these are useful for your adventures!
However, it seems that the bottle that holds the liquid memory was damaged during <cf>delivery</cf>. ......
We are unable to open the store as it is, so we have asked <cf>adventurers</cf> to help us out!
We can get the materials for the <cf>bin by collecting at "<value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>".
Can you deliver one <cf> each of "Frozen Star Grass" and "Piled Ore"?
Once the bins are made, we can open the store. <cf>We will give one bottle to each adventurer as well.
<cf>We apologize for the trouble, but <cf>please do so!
Take care, adventurers!
Oh, no, no, no. ....... <cf>Well, take care!
...... Patty will be training in customer service until the ingredients arrive. <cf>Opening is just around the corner. We're running out of time.
Oh, sister?　What's wrong? <cf>Your eyes are scary. ......?
<cf>Could you please deliver one each of "Frozen Star Grass" and "Piled Mine"?
You can get them at <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>. <cf>You don't have to go that deep to find them.
Dear Adventurer! <cf>I see you brought the materials for the bottles!
Thank you very much! <cf>Now you can open the memory stand!
Oh!　You're doing it!
<span size="Big">Pa-tee? </>
...... Will do, won't you?
Sorry ....... Dear Adventurer. <cf>Thank you again!
Here is your reward, a bottle of liquid memory. <cf>Please accept it.
Since you are here, let me <cf>explain to you how to use it properly</cf>.
<cf>Liquid memory automatically accumulates experience and memories in accordance with the adventurer's activities.
And when it has accumulated enough, it will "activate". <cf>You will be able to tell immediately because it will change color.
When you use the memory stand, <cf>please bring the activated liquid memory with you!
We will purify it using our proprietary technology and serve it to you as <cf>a delicious drink!
For example, if you use the liquid memory we just gave you, you will <cf>get the effect of "increasing the amount of materials collected"!
The condition for activation is "defeating monsters". <cf>I think it will activate naturally if you are adventuring!
<cf>You can get more materials with the same number of times of gathering by utilizing this liquid memory.
You can also reduce the number of times you need to collect. <cf>That would give you more time to do other things!
I think it will help you broaden your adventures!
This is not the only kind of liquid memory. <cf>Please find others and make use of them!
Okay then, Patty. <cf>Please get ready for the opening.
I'm on it!
...... leave it to me?
Huh. ....... I hope that's okay.
The liquid memory that you just saw, <cf>has already been activated.
If you like, you can use it right after this!
Please continue to utilize the memory stand to <cf>advance your adventures more efficiently!
I picked up a bottle of liquid memory.
 <cf>Atta I'm so talented!
Um, where do I press? <cf>...... Well, I have a hunch!
<cf>After all, I have talent! <cf>I can operate a machine with ease~!
<cf>Adventurer, will you take care of it? <cf>Yay!　Thank you!
Oh, no, thank you very much. ......? <cf>Thank you onega......onegaishimasu?
......Yeah, no. <cf>I'm still practicing my customer service lingo.
It'll take a while, so I'll just talk normally.
Actually, I was refining a drink, but <cf>I didn't know how to use the equipment.
I was operating it on a hunch, and it broke down. <cf>I didn't even do anything!
So I need some parts to fix it.
Di-Job. I've done the research on what I need.
Let's see, the "Engram Separator" from the Buffalia heritage. <cf> It's used to clean up liquid memory.
But hey, ....... <cf>I have no idea where to get one!
It doesn't seem to be sold in stores. <cf>Adventurers don't know either?
It's a Buffalo legacy, so maybe ...... ruins? <cf>But there are so many ruins!
<cf>I wonder if the priests and <cf>priestesses of the Buffalian religion know about them?
Anyway, right now I want "Engram Separator" more than I want pocket money, <cf>more than I want a senior who doesn't get angry!
Please!　Please! <cf>Please go find me an "Engram Separator"!
...... Huh? <cf>I think I used the proper honorific just now?
I don't care what your means are! <cf>I'll give you a new bottle of liquid memory as a thank you!
<cf>I got one too, as a commemorative gift for the opening. <cf>I can use it in the store!
<cf>Please!　Just like this! <cf>I'll have to give you a lecture again if the lady at the store finds out!
Just one "Engram Separator"! <cf>Thank you very much!
How's that? <cf>Did you find the Engram Separator?
I'm sure a Buffalian priest or something would <cf>know where to find it: ......
They haven't found out yet that you destroyed the device in the store. <cf>But please do it as soon as possible!
Welcome to the Temple of Buffalia. <cf>God will always watch over us!
Is there something you wish to inquire about? <cf>I will ask if I may.
Is ...... the place where the "Engram Separator" is found? <cf>Yes, indeed, the Order is in charge of the heritage of Buffalia.
<cf>We keep records of what is found in the ruins and what is taken out of the ruins.
Let us look into the "Engram Separator". <cf>Please wait a moment!
Thank you for your patience. ...... <cf>We have been looking into the location where the "Engram Separator" was found.
But ....... <cf>It may be difficult even for adventurers to obtain it.
The Engram Separator is to be found at the innermost part of the Pillar of the Divine Suspension.
Have you ever heard of the Pillar of the Divine Presence? <cf> It is the site of a magnificent tower to the north of the Hill of the Divine Watch.
This is one of the most important holy places in the Buffalo-Brazilian religion. <cf>No one is allowed to enter without special permission!
Eh?　You have a permit and ......?
...... This is definitely a permit to enter the Gobashira ....... <cf>I see....... You are Einlein-sama's ......
No, my apologies. <cf>If you have a permit, no problem.
<cf>You are welcome to enter the "Shinkake no Mikashira". <cf>Please also bring the "Engram Separator" with you.
<cf>There is a great deal of Buffalian heritage in the Order's sacred sites and ruins.
It is the will of the <cf>God of Buffalia</cf> that they be used by human hands to enrich the earth!
Of course, we cannot allow the ruins to be destroyed more than necessary.
But this time I am asking for a purpose. <cf>There is nothing wrong with taking out one of the legacies.
It is true that there are numerous legacies left in the Gobashira. <cf>Taking it back and utilizing it is a sign of faith in God.
...... And if you are the one you mentioned, Einlein-sama, <cf>there can be not a single mistake.
Sorry, I'm talking about this one.
Please do <value type="locationName" id="dng005"/>. <cf>"Engram separator" is allowed to be taken out.
Please be careful. <cf>May the God of Buffalia guide you.
Did you find the "Engram Separator"<cf> you were looking for?
You may want to do <value type="locationName" id="dng005"/>. <cf>You should be able to get it at the very back.
You have someone who needs it, don't you? <cf>Please deliver it to them.
Oh, the "Engram Separator"! <cf>You really brought it!
Thank you! <cf>Now I won't have to get angry!
Yes, well, here! <cf>Thank you for the bottle of liquid memory.
Let's see, the description says ......<cf>"Increases the speed at which materials can be collected!
Does this work for me too? <cf>When I pick up coins, can I pick them up with a "shubha"?　I wonder if this will work for me too?
<cf>"Accomplishing missions" will increase the activation, so <cf>you'll have to try and complete them as many times as you can!
Oh, and by the way. Important story.
...... I broke the equipment in the store, and <cf>I don't tell anyone that I talk like this!
I wonder what would happen if your sister found out. ......
[I wonder what would happen?
Yikes!　I'm <span size="Big">getting out of here! </>
...... Oh, well, we'll be <cf>waiting for your continued <span size="Big">use,</span> ......!
Patti has <span size="Big">something for you</span>!
Oh no!
Liquid memory bottles can be found in <cf>all sorts of places!
<cf>There are a lot of people who use them as rewards for their adventurers!
You might want to check <cf>the Pioneer Bureau's requests and such</cf>!
...... You, what do you want from me?
Maybe you've heard something about it... ...... <cf>Now is not a good time.
We'll talk again when the time comes. ......
Well, you. <cf>Don't you want to spare some money......?
The more money you spend, the less you have....... <cf>That's a real live-and-let-live kind of worry, isn't it? Hey,......?
<cf>You are doing me a favor, though, aren't you? <cf>Maybe that trouble will get a little better......
Well, ...... the fun will come later. <cf>Let's hear my story first: ......
I think it's somewhere around ......<cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>" in the east of the Baha Mar Plateau these days.
The Horngoats are on the rampage ....... <cf>But not just any horngoat: ......
His name is "<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>"...... <cf> He's a troubled man who reacts to the engrams of the dead and goes berserk.
Thanks to him, the dead who buried their bones can't <cf>sleep in peace</cf>. ......
If you take it down, <cf>I'll give you something good:</cf>......
<cf>something exorbitant that won't make it into the regular distribution system. ......
I don't think that's a bad deal. ......
I'm asking you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>. ......
What's the matter ...... you forgot ......? <cf>Good, good...... forgetting is also a privilege of the living......
East of the Baha Mar Plateau, "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>"...... <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>", we're taking down the Horngoat.
We're counting on you. ......
I don't have to ask if you're back ....... <cf>You've done it,......
The footsteps of "<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_01_01001"/>" have stopped....... <cf>Their strange, grating footsteps have stopped......
Now we can all sleep peacefully. ......
Very well, I'll give you this bottle: ......
As you can see, it's a bottle of liquid memory. <cf> But don't show it to too many people. ......
If people find out you have this stuff, the city will be in turmoil....... <cf>You won't get a free pass either......
That bin is something that reduces the consumption of money....... <cf>Not in the sense of saving money.
'<cf>The price of everything is cheaper when you use the facilities for adventurers'<cf>......
What, I'm just <cf>tweaking your awareness of your surroundings a little bit. ...... No harm done.
No one will even notice. ...... <cf>Unless you're showing off.
<cf>I don't know what will happen if someone with greed realizes it......
...... Do you <cf>care</cf> why I have all this stuff?
......I have been living in the underworld for a long time. <cf>I've been dealing with the people who pull the strings of the world from the shadows. ......
I thought I was taking advantage of their greed, but <cf>I was also entangled in their ...... desires.
I found myself being preyed upon by this one: ...... <cf>People are really stupid......
......I may have rambled on a bit too much. <cf>Take good care of that bottle. ......
How you handle the light and the dark is up to you. ...... <cf>Stand well. ......
Louise,...... sorry. <cf>I didn't know what I was doing was taking a back seat to the monsters. ......
I'm just glad you made it back alive. <cf>Take good care of yourself. Don't push yourself too hard.
Oh, wow!　Louise! <cf>I'll collect it next time when I recover!
<cf> I'll try to collect it next time! Good luck. <cf>I'm counting on you!
However, I'm in trouble. <cf> Is there anyone else we can ask?
Oh? <cf> Will you accept my request?
Huh?　You can do Louise's request too ......? <cf>This request is very difficult. Are you sure you can handle it?
But you seem to know what you're doing. ...... <cf>Maybe you can do it!
If you say so, Louise. ...... <cf>Not my place to say. Good luck to you.
<cf>I'm Louise, a liquid memory researcher.
Various adventurers have volunteered to help me gather materials for the project.
But the monsters are so strong, <cf>everyone fails.
I'm ashamed to say that I was one of those who failed. <cf>I wanted to show Louise my good side.
<cf>If you complete the request, I'll give you a bottle of liquid memory that I'm developing.
There are two kinds of materials needed.
First of all, I want you to collect <cf> "Full Moon Stone" from <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>.
Full moon stones" are <cf> indistinguishable</cf> from ordinary stones during the daytime, so please collect them at night.
However, it seems that <cf>very powerful monsters appear near the places where you can collect them.
<cf>If you find them tough, turn back immediately. <cf>Don't fall down!
<cf>I think it's a good idea to use liquid memory to speed up the gathering process.
It takes less time to collect, <cf>so it will be a little safer.
Oh, I see you already have it. <cf> This is the time to use liquid memory.
<cf>I'll tell you about the next material if you deliver the "Full Moon Stone" to me.
<cf>Then, please. <cf>Have a safe trip~!
I hope your material collection is going well.　<cf>Gather up the "Full Moon Stone".
You can find it in the east of the Baha Mar Plateau. <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>"
You can only collect it at night, don't forget.
There are strong monsters, so don't overdo it.
Did you bring the "Full Moon Stone"?
Yay! That's great, great, great! <cf> You are so strong!
Thanks to you, we have all the "full moon rocks" we need.
Now, let's look at the other material. <cf>"Nikkoumame" found in <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>.
The opposite of the previous one, <cf>this one can only be found during the daytime.
You have to collect it while the sun is shining. <cf> You can't collect them at night.
<cf>Be sure to be prepared.
<cf>There is no need to be in a hurry. <cf>It's important to take it easy and rest~!
<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/><cf>Collect "Nikkoumame" at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>".
This can only be found during the daytime. <cf>Gather them while the sun is shining.
You'll have all the materials you need now. <cf>When you're done, I'll give you something good!
Wow, you really are a "Nikkoumame"! <cf>You've gathered it all up!
Wow!　Thank you so much.
Then, I'll give you the bottle of liquid memory that I promised you.
This bottle will make it easier for you to get materials when you kill monsters.
<cf>It will be very useful when you want to collect materials from monsters.
<cf>Liquid memory is activated when you "collect".
I hope you can use it when you fight a lot of monsters to collect materials!
How about it?　Isn't it a very useful effect? <cf> Louise's latest work!
Oh, thank goodness! Thanks to you, I can start my next research project!
You're really great! <cf>I'd love to work with you again!
<cf>That was Louise........................................bye~bye~!
<cf>A bottle of liquid memory is often used as a reward for requests.
Check out the request form at the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>A wonderful reward may be waiting for you~~!
Cawk!　I'm getting good results, though. <cf>I'm almost there...
<cf>I wonder if there's anyone out there who could be a good role model for me.
Oh!　Are you alone?
Welcome, welcome. <cf>I'm glad you've come from so far away.
I'm Mea. This is Mei. <cf>I'm helping to organize the team. Nice to meet you!
Since you came to us, you must be interested in the team, right?
What is a team anyway?　Mea.
You must have some hobbies, goals, or something. <You must have some hobbies or goals, like taking a leisurely stroll or exploring some ruins.
<cf>Gathering together like-minded people with a common goal like that is what a team is all about.
<cf>A party is formed on a case-by-case basis and works together to conquer a dungeon or something, right?
A team is a bigger group.
They are connected by the same goals and desires, and <cf>usually work freely.
We share information and praise each other's accomplishments.
Of course, you can also form a party with other members of your team.
We're going on an adventure, aren't we? <cf>We want to have fun with people who share our interests, don't we?
Mea-san, Mei-san~! <cf>This is a new plan!　I'm confident this time!
This time, we're all going to break through the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" together!
Oh, you're here. <cf>This is the new team I told you about in the request.
[<cf>They are the newbie team that I told you about in the request! [<cf> They've got a very ambitious goal, though.
However, we stumbled at the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" and we're having a hard time.
If we don't do something, we'll be grandmothers by the time we get to the end of the trail.
So here's the thing. You should set an example for us.
<value type="locationName" id="dng009"/>" and get rid of it. <cf>I'll let the newbies see how it's done.
Just as well, and go with a good group of like-minded people! <cf>It's not cool to go alone, is it?
It's just a trial run before we form a team.
<cf>I'm looking forward to working with you, senpai! <cf>We'll study together!
<cf>All right, I'm counting on you. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation.
<cf>You're just in time, go with a group of like-minded people! <cf>This is just a trial run before we form a team.
<cf> If you don't get going soon, you'll lose the day!
Oh, you're back!
You've come a long way. <cf>Are you hurt?
It looks like you did all right. <cf> We were right on target!
<cf>Thank you for the other day! <cf>I was so moved by your courage, I couldn't help but watch!
<cf>We are all excited that now we don't have to be afraid of "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" anymore!
<cf>We'll definitely trudge through the next one, "Valley of the Machine Traces"!
<cf>Thank you very much. <cf>These kids look so happy!
<cf>When you broke through the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon,"<cf>the whole team cheered loudly, you know?
The most attractive thing about a team is that we can share a goal like that and get <cf>excited together!
You want to make a team!　I want to be a part of it! <cf> you want to join us, just let us know!
We're always open to you. We're waiting for you!
You guys should get into it! <cf> Don't embarrass the adventurers!
Hey!　Sister Mea and sister Mei! <cf> Thank you for your hospitality!
Ah!
I'm following the example of your adventurers! <cf>Nali, take a cue from your sisters!
We will face them and try to build up our skills!
Please refrain from doing so!　<span size="Big">Thank you very much! </>
Oh ....... <cf>That's not how it works. ......
That's a lot of trouble. ......
Hmmm, what was it? <cf>I should do something, but I can't remember......
But I didn't write down anything that looks like it: ......
Oops?
'Welcome. <cf>Welcome to the livery store!'
'A new service on the topic! <cf>We're starting to adjust lightness and saturation!
<cf>Meat and eggs are on sale!　Buy some and go home!"
...... Oh, that's the wrong memo!　This was a different note!
Well, thank you <cf> for accepting my request. Adventurer.
Actually, the coloring store will now offer a new service, <cf>'lightness and saturation adjustment'!
So, the manager told me to <cf>collect the necessary materials for the necessary "[coloring agent]"<cf>. ......
I lost the note that said that, and <cf>I forgot all about it!
I've always had a hard time remembering things. ...... <cf>I write down everything about my work.
Sometimes I even read different things.
Anyway, I turned over my notes and found the material for <cf>"[colorant]".
Please collect the <cf>'tone flowers' that are blooming in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>.
Me, I'm stuck working on something else. ...... <cf>It's because I lost my notes. Sorry about that!
I will <cf>make sure to leave a note of what I asked the adventurers to do!
I've also made a note of the rewards! <cf>I won't lose this!
I'm stuck working on something else, ....... <cf>Sorry, thank you!
I see that you collected the "Tone Flower"! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
<cf>Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I'll give you one in return.
Let's see, here are some notes on what you can do with the "Color Mixer": ......
<cf>The package was delivered by mistake to the weapon shop.
Hawaaaaaa!　I forgot to contact you! <cf>Senpai, senpai-ooo!
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting, adventurer. ......
<cf>Thank you again for collecting the materials for the "colorant"!
This time, I will explain the new service. <cf>The memo is this!
'Using the coloring agent, you will be able to adjust the <cf>lightness and saturation</cf> of the store's new service!
'This will <cf>additionally expand the range of coloring for costumes.'
'<cf>Adjusting the lightness changes the brightness of the color. <cf>Raising it makes the colors whiter and lowering it makes them darker.
Adjusting saturation changes the vibrancy of the colors. <cf> Increase to make colors more vivid, and decrease to make colors duller.
Color enhancers can be used alone, but we recommend combining them with dyes.
"By adjusting the brightness and saturation, you can create a color more to your liking than ever before.
<cf>"Please give it a try!"
Marche, you're amazing! <cf>Explained perfectly!
Even with your notes, you've done a great job!
Yay! <cf>Thank you, senior!
Thank you <cf>again</cf>, adventurers, for your cooperation!
<cf>We look forward to working with you and Marche in the future!
Well then, we're ready to go. ......
Thank you for your patience!　The cutting edge of fashion in town! <cf>It's a new service at the livery store!
Ah, adventurers! <cf>Erm, ...... notes, notes for this kind of thing.
'How do you like your lightness and saturation adjusted?
'By all means, have fun with the outfit of your choice!
Oh!　Hey there, adventurer on the road! <cf>Would you like to hear some adventure advice?
I'm a man who calls himself an adventure advisor. <cf>I'm a guy who calls himself an adventure advisor, and I've been planting seeds of advice every day.
The one I'm trying right now is <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>-training!
I got the idea for this training method from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>.
You drink an infusion of "Highland Fox's Ingrown Claw" and <cf>train your body to imagine agile movement.
It is said to be effective in regulating the stomach!
I was about to run out of "Highland Fox's Ingrown Nails" and thought <cf>I'd go get them on my own. ......
I'm not very good at it! I'm no match for <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>!
I tried "weapon tuning" for a reversal, but the results were<cf>not good enough. No luck, it seems!
Tuning is one way to enhance a weapon.
You know how to 'plug in' a weapon? <cf>Tuning is a way to enhance a weapon by adding abilities to it.
Tuning can change the accuracy of that <cf>ability!
The more accurate the same ability is, the stronger it is! So that's what you're going for with <cf>tuning!
Check the number of sockets on the weapon when crafting! <cf>Ability is given there by plug attachment!
And then enhance the abilities by tuning! <cf>This makes it easier to understand.
Just here is a "Tuning Ticket". <cf>How about this as a reward?
<cf>Gather the "Highland Fox's Curly Nails" from <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/> and <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>.
I'll give you <cf>more advice on tuning when I give you the ticket!
I'll give you a "tuning ticket" as a reward. <cf>Thank you!
Ow, you're back! <cf>I've certainly received the "Highland Fox's Curly Nails" as well!
Now you can resume your training. <cf>...... Well, the effect is bemusing. Yup.
Well then, I'll exchange it for a "Tuning Ticket". <cf>You should definitely give tuning a try.
Check your weapons first. <cf>Plugging it in will give you abilities.
Certain parameters will be increased, <cf>class skills will be enhanced, and so on!
And the most important thing to note is its accuracy!
Tuning will increase the accuracy of <cf> abilities!
You can even get the highest precision abilities available! <cf>You can change your weapon to your liking as you go along!
However, the result of tuning is random!
It depends on your luck and perseverance to get the desired accuracy!
<cf>There is a possibility that the effect will be lower than the current ability's effect, so <cf>you need to be careful about that.
Also, you can <cf>"keep" and protect abilities that you don't need to change the accuracy of.
You can keep good abilities by keeping them, and they'll be safe!
Just like any adventure, don't get discouraged and keep trying. <cf>That way you'll get closer to your ideal weapon!
Use your plugs and tuning to get the weapon that <cf>is right for you!
That's all the advice I have for you today! <cf>Don't neglect your training and tuning!
Have you tried tuning? <cf>Perseverance is the key. Don't get discouraged.
Damn, this paper is just a pipe dream!
The key to solving the mystery of "Floating Island in the Void" ....... <cf>I guess I'll just have to get the real thing somehow: ......
I am Frederik, an employee of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I'm a man whose mind is trapped in the quest for the unknown.
Have you ever heard of "The Floating Island in the Void"?
The Floating Island in the Void is a space that can be visited at random times through a star vein hole.
For some reason, monsters of incomparably greater strength appear there.
If left unattended, they may escape from the floating island. <cf>This is why many adventurers give top priority to defeating them.
<cf>The Pioneer Bureau is also taking the utmost precautions against the appearance of the star vein holes that lead to the "floating island in the void.
It is such a dangerous and peculiar place. <cf>But why and where does such a place exist?
I am eager to solve the mystery of this place!
The Floating Island of the Void must also be somewhere in Regnus. <cf> But I have no idea where it is!
No matter how much research I do into old documents, maps, and records of adventurers' explorations,<cf> the location of the floating island is still unclear!
So here it is. <cf>I want you to take part in the battle on the floating island in the void.
<cf>It is believed that the demi-dragons that appear on the "floating island in the void" generate a special substance within their bodies.
<cf>This is called the "Void Dragon's Evening Color Crystal". <cf>I want you to obtain this.
It will give you clues about "The Floating Island of the Void". <cf>If you defeat the demi-dragon, you should be able to get it.
I'll give you a special case. <cf>Put it in this and take it home with you.
I must remind you that you can only get it from the <cf>demi-dragon</cf> that appears on the "Floating Island in the Void.
The star vein pits appear in the "Andorra Basin". <cf>Other adventurers will gather there then.
Without a doubt, this battle will be a fight to the death. <cf>Prepare well before taking on this challenge.
Defeat the demi-dragon on the "floating island in the void" and <cf>obtain the "Void Dragon's Evening Color Crystal" for me.
The star vein hole leading to the "Floating Island in the Void" will appear in <cf>"Andorra Basin". I ask you!
It is a star vein hole leading to the "Floating Island in the Void.
The presence of a powerful enemy is in the air. ...... <cf> Once inside, a battle will be inevitable!
Hahahahaha!　That went well, didn't it? <cf>Thanks, adventurers!
<cf>This is the first time I've been able to see the actual crystal you obtained, <cf>the "Evening Color Crystal of the Vain Dragon!
<cf>The "Vain Dragon Sunset Crystal" disintegrates rapidly once it leaves the floating island. <cf>Hence, it was impossible to transport it to the city!
So I co-developed a memory stand and case. <cf>It was half a gamble whether it would work or not, but ......
That's fantastic! <cf>You and I witnessed a historic moment!
This is just my theory: ......
<cf>There is no clear difference between the monsters that appear on the "floating island in the void" and those that live near the city.
Then, why do they become so powerful only on the "floating island in the void"?
It is because the place itself, the "floating island in the void," <cf>gives power to the monsters.
<cf>As such power accumulates in a monster's body, changes are bound to occur.
That's why you brought back the "Void Dragon's Evening Color Crystal!
Of course, this is not the only way to solve the mystery. <cf>But it is a big step forward in my research!
Thank you!　I would like to thank you <cf> both as a researcher and as a member of the Bureau!
<cf>The battle on the "floating island in the void" is extremely intense. <cf>The Pioneering Bureau is well aware of this.
That is why, in addition to the usual rewards, we have prepared additional rewards based on your <cf>contribution</cf>.
There are many ways to contribute. <cf>You can find a form that suits your style.
Of course, you should do it within a reasonable range. <cf>If you fail to defeat them, there is nothing to be gained.
The Pioneer Bureau is looking for adventurers to fight on the "floating island in the void! <cf>Please join forces and fight off the mighty monsters!
<cf>Let's thoroughly investigate "The Void Dragon's Evening Color Crystal". <cf>It will be some time before we see the results.
<cf>Please join in the large-scale battle and hone your skills!
The Pioneer Bureau is expecting great things from you adventurers. <cf>Of course, I feel the same way!
After all, the ...... desert is nice. ...... <cf>All those fascinating stones.......
Come to think of it, my ...... journey started in the ...... desert, too!
Around here, ...... I met my first stone....... <cf>"Coarse ore" is lying ......
It's not a rare thing......, but it's a stone that <cf>I have ...... feelings about... ...
When I was picking up the stone,......<cf> I suddenly remembered that I wanted to see ...... it again,......
Could you please get me about 20 pieces of "crude ore" ......<cf>?
With small stones. ...... <cf>It's beautiful when packed in small bottles. ...... I missed it.
You should be able to collect ...... "crude ore" at "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>"
The desert monsters are ...... too tough for me to go ......<cf>get it. ......
I never used to be so ......<cf>troubled<cf>by monsters before!
Oh, by the way, I was looking for ...... stones and I picked up something ......<cf>interesting......
It's a bottle of liquid memory. ...... <cf>Let me trade this guy for the "crude ore" ............
I'll check out the ...... effects before I come back. <cf>Whatever it is, it should be useful ......
<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>" for 20 ...... "Coarse Ores" ...... <cf>I'm asking for it ......
I'll check ...... before replacing the liquid memory bin ......<cf>I'll check ...... before replacing the liquid memory bin ......
Oh ...... it's 'crude ore' ....... <cf>It's beautiful when you collect it. I miss it. ......
It looks ...... like a normal stone, doesn't it......? <cf>You're right,...... it's a very ordinary stone,......
But to me ...... it's an unusual stone....... <cf>Can you understand this feeling......
When I was a child,...... I saw something ordinary,......<cf>that seemed special and shiny,...... only to me... ...
I collected them in secret and ...... made them my own personal treasures. ...... <cf>Don't you remember such ......?
I was so ...... this stone. <cf>It was the ...... first step to falling in love with a stone. ......
It reminds me ...... of the old days. Thank you ......
It's the promised ...... bottle of liquid memory....... <cf> let me make it work for you ......
It will give you a ......<cf>'Bonus to GC's for completing missions'......
'Challenging the arena' seems to activate ......
Maybe it brings good luck. ...... <cf>Some stones are said to do so: ......
Maybe someday someone will be ...... enthralled by this bottle too,......<cf> and feel the way I do now,......
I heard that sometimes you can get ...... liquid memory bottles as a <cf>reward for a request from the Pioneer Bureau. ......
It's ...... good to look for it. <cf>The value of things is ...... different for each ...... person.
Hmm?　You wanted to see me, sir?
I'm not often approached by people,....... <cf>I see, you have a strange look.
It seems that there is someone who needs your help. <cf>Please listen to all of us!
I am Zoe. <cf>I am a fortune teller and merchant.
I deal in curiosities and do not accept monetary transactions. <cf>I am known as an eccentric. Please make my acquaintance.
<cf>Your presence is known to us by divination.
<cf>"When you are in distress, salvation will come to you. <cf> I saw your image along with those words.
As a matter of fact, we are troubled.
A pregnant woman in my neighborhood is showing signs of danger. <cf>There is a strong possibility that she will soon suffer a calamity.
We need to give her an exorcism while we are at it. ......
The flower called "Mother Green" that is used for this is <cf>unavailable!
This is a very difficult flower to obtain, <cf>it only blooms in front of selected people.
It is not even available in the markets of Asterlys.
But I am sure you can find it. <cf>You have heard of my request.
<cf>"Mother Green" grows wild on the Baha Mar Plateau, <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>.
It will blossom in your presence. <cf>Please go and collect them!
<cf>"Mother Green" grows wild on the Baha Mar Plateau at <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>.
Welcome back, adventurer. How was <cf>'Mother Green'?
Oh ......!　This is indeed "Mother Green"! <cf>Thank you!
This flower has the power to protect the mother's womb. <cf>It is not a kind of spell, really.
<cf>If I hadn't made it in time, both mother and child would have been in danger. <cf>Thank you so much, adventurer.
<cf>I was right about the phase you had in mind.
<cf>You have been chosen for Mother Green, which means that you will have a very eventful path ahead of you.
Perhaps it will help you along the way. <cf>Please take this.
A bottle of liquid memory. <cf>"Reduces the Luno consumption of weapon crafting.
<cf>"Defeating monsters" will also activate this bottle of liquid memory.
It is somewhat unusual, so <cf>please don't say too much about it</cf> ......
I sell items like this that <cf>are not generally available to the public.
Mother Green" is one of them. <cf>This is also why I do not accept money.
<cf>You are a very special person when you approached me.
<cf>Thank you so much for this opportunity. <cf>I will support you on your way.
<cf>I hope we have the opportunity to meet again. <cf>I hope you will listen to me!
A bottle of liquid memory is a valuable <cf>reward for your request.
I have heard that the bottles I have given away sometimes end up in the hands of <cf>adventurers</cf>.
Please see the request from the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I have something to tell you that will help you.
<cf>Thank you very much for accepting my request!
Oh, did I say that a little wrong? <cf>I'm starting to understand some of the customer service terms.
Oh well. <cf>I'm getting tired, so I'll talk in my usual tone!
<cf>The drinks at our store are very popular. <cf>We're always running out of ingredients for the bottles.
<cf>We're running out of bottles very quickly, so we have to place an order for them. <cf>This is complicated, and to be honest, I don't really understand it!
So, when I'm in trouble, I go to adventurers!
Why don't we just ask the adventurers to gather them for us? <cf>I'm so clever!
What I want is the Coast Glass. <cf>But I've never seen it sold in stores.
<cf>I can buy it if it's on sale. <cf>I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of ordering it.
So, I ask you, adventurers! <cf>Please find me some Coast Glass!
If you can't find it in the store, how about the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>I hear they keep all sorts of materials there.
<cf>If you can get it, you can get anything you want! <cf>We'll take whatever we can get.
I'll get you another bottle of liquid memory in return.
Okay, now I'm an order master too! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
I've been asked to order the Coast Glass, but <cf>I'm okay with it anyway, as long as it's ready.
Adventurers, please find me <cf>coast glass</cf> wherever you can!
The Pioneer Bureau keeps all kinds of materials, so <cf>I think you should ask there.
Oh, adventurer. <cf>What can the Pioneer Bureau do for you?
...... I see. <cf>I'm looking for "Coast Glass", you say.
It's certainly a material that the Pioneer Bureau keeps in storage. <cf>It's used for building exteriors, heritage restorations, etc.
But I'm in a bind. I'd like to help, but <cf>the ones we have now are already scheduled to be used.
It takes a bit of work to collect, <cf>and it's not something you can find in the stores. ......
Sorry. <cf>I think it would be faster to find it myself.
<cf>The location where we found the Coast Grass is <cf>The Lake Lydd Tunnel.
<cf>You're familiar with it, since it's where you'll be going for your registration exam.
<cf>If you search deep enough, you should be able to find it. <cf>I'll have to get it locally, but I'll be counting on you.
Coast Glass can be obtained by exploring <cf>deep into the Lake Lydd Tunnel</cf>.
<cf>I don't think you'll get lost, since it's where you'll be going for your registration exam.
Sorry, but you'll have to get it on your own. <cf>Take it straight to the client.
Oh, it's "Coast Glass"! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
That's great, you're doing it! <cf>Then I'll give you a bottle of Liquid Memory as a thank-you!
The effect is "Increase the selling price of materials". <cf>Nice!　A bargain!
It's going to be useful for adventurers, isn't it? <cf>I've finished placing my order too, so I'm all set!
<cf>I guess my sister will be here soon, but <cf>I won't have to be lectured this time!
Yes, I've been watching you since the middle of the show. I've been watching you from the middle, Patty.
Yay, sis! <cf>How's it going?　My order was perfect, wasn't it?
Don't do it that complicated way, <cf>just ask the adventurer to do it from the beginning!
That's right. ...... <cf>It's my fault for not explaining it properly.
Patti. I keep track of the inventory and the number of orders in the store to <cf>make sure there are no mistakes!
It's a matter of money. <cf>It involves wholesalers' purchases and sales, and also credit!
You absolutely cannot prepare it without going through the store. <cf>I should have made it clear that <cf>......
And I didn't know ......! <cf>That's why I was being such a mendoza!
Don't be mendocious. <cf>[--]Don't think only of the easy things.
<span size="Big">Hey! </>
Dear Adventurer. <cf>Thank you so much for doing Patti a favor!
We will <cf>thankfully</cf> use the "Coast Glass" you provided!
Of course, you are not at fault. <cf>Please also make use of the liquid memory bottles!
Yes, Patty. Say hello.
Oh, thank you very much! <cf>We look forward to serving you in the future!
...... I'll have to teach you how to use language later.
Oh, no!
Are you using the liquid memory?　Adventurer.
Well, something doesn't feel right about ....... <cf>Wording is difficult~!
I wish they would sell Liquid Memory, <cf>which makes everyone speak politely, at the store. ......
Kimi, are you interested in fishing?
It's a great way to relax between adventures and <cf>earn some extra money with the fish you catch!
It's a great hobby for adventurers! <cf>If you're interested, please give us another call!
Interested in fishing? <cf>That's very good!
My name is Andor. I'm an angler. <cf>I'm just trying to get people interested in fishing.
It's fun to play with the fish across the water. <cf>I recommend it for a break from adventure!
Hmm?　You say you've never been fishing before? <cf>Hahaha, no problem!
Let me give you a full lecture<cf>on everything from choosing a location to tips on how to catch fish!
First of all, you can't fish everywhere. <cf>There are good "spots" where you can catch fish.
Try going to a marina in a harbor. <cf>You'll find a good spot to fish.
<cf>When fishing, be careful of the 'tension' of the fishing line. <cf> If you tension it too much, it will break and the fish will run away.
If you reel it in, you'll catch fish, but if that's all you do,<cf> you'll quickly get tensioned up.
<cf>In such a case, you have to tilt the rod in the direction where the fish is. <cf>Then you can loosen the tension.
Keep your eyes on the water and stay calm. <cf>If you reel in and pull the fish to your hand, you'll get it: ......
Good!　Nice catch, congrats!
Sometimes you can catch something other than fish. <cf>Some items seem surprisingly practical to get.
The fish and items you catch will be sent to the warehouse. <cf>Don't forget to check!
Well then, catch three "Aster Koaji". <cf>I hope you can take this opportunity to learn the names of the fish.
<cf>You can also catch "Aster Koajin," which vary in size and purchase price, but be sure not to make a mistake!
Our target this time is "Aster Koaji". <cf>We'll be waiting for you in anticipation. Good luck!
Oh, you want a refresher on fishing? <cf> Leave it to me!
Fishing is done in spots where you can catch fish. <cf>You'll find them at the marina.
Reel in the fishing line, paying attention to the tension of the line. <cf>If you tilt the rod toward the fish, the tension will loosen.
If you can pull the fish to your hand, you can catch it.
My goal is to catch three "Aster Koa Ji". <cf>Don't mistake them for other fish. Good luck!
Oh, welcome back! <cf>Sounds like you had a good catch!
Yeah, all the fish are good! <cf>You're a pretty good angler.
You can go to the spot and fish anytime you want. <cf>You can go to a spot and fish anytime you want.
You can fish alone or with a group of friends. <cf>It's also fun to fish with a group of friends!
If you are an adventurer, you can even compete with your team to see how many fish you can catch!
<cf>Adventurers can sell the fish they catch for money. <cf>Adventurers are always in need of things!
As fishing becomes more popular, <cf>you may even find new uses for the fish you catch!
It's fun and profitable! <cf>Fishing is such a good leisure activity!
<cf>I hope you will help spread the word about fishing! <cf> Keep up the good fishing!
Hey, are you fishing today?
You can go fishing alone or with a crowd!　Or you can get a lot of people together! <cf>There are endless ways to enjoy fishing!
Enjoy a good fishing life!
<cf>I hear that in each class, there is a potential that has not yet been discovered.
<cf>I shall not cease my quest and study to lead you to even greater heights!
Someday, when the time comes for fate to show you where you will end up, <cf> you may come and visit me again.
[--] Hmm, you have improved your skills.
Competence shows in your bearing. <cf>Your manners are refined and beautiful.
You have accumulated experience and solid strength. <cf>I can see your journey so far.
Then let me lead you to greater heights.
What I am going to teach you is called <cf>"Tactical Abilities.
It is a technique that enhances the skills of each class, and can greatly expand the scope and possibilities of <cf>fighting</cf>.
However, it requires a certain level of skill to master.
Can you truly master Tactical Abilities? <cf>I would like to see it with my own eyes once again.
Do you know "The Ruins of the Giant Tower"? <cf> I want you to step through these ruins.
It will not be a difficult task. <cf>I will be watching the battle from a distance.
I hope that your path will be paved. <cf>Good luck.
<cf>I will see with my own eyes if you can master your tactical abilities.
I challenge you to take up the challenge of "Investigating the Ruins of the Giant Tower."
I don't think it will be a difficult task, but <cf>you must be on your toes!
<cf>You're back from "Ruins of the Giant Tower"? <cf>Your fight, I witnessed it with my own eyes.
It's truly magnificent. <cf>It seems my eyes were not mistaken.
Now, let me <cf>tell you about your tactical abilities.
<cf>I will teach you tactical abilities. <cf>You may visit me when you are ready.
<cf>You will need the <cf>Protector of the Warrior</cf> to do so. Do not forget it.
The Warrior's Talisman is <cf>a fragment of an ancient document on the ancient martial arts.
I collect them for further study of the martial arts. <cf>It gives me hints on skills and other martial arts.
If I continue my quest, I may <cf>unnel</cf> another mastery of the martial arts.
The <cf>Protector of the Warrior</cf> should be available through the adventure board.
You can check the request to the Pioneering Bureau, etc. <cf>The Adventure Board will be available as a reward.
Tactical abilities exist in addition to the ones I give you.
You may <cf>gain them at a moment's notice as you conquer your journey.
You may find that you <cf>may</cf> gain them at a moment's notice as you travel your journey.
I hope your tactical abilities will help you through the hardest of battles.
Mm, here we are. <cf>It is truly good to see that you are not negligent in your training.
Have you been taking advantage of class changes since then?
If you experience more than one class, <cf>you will gain more insight into the class you are best at.
However, there are some things that may be troubling. <cf>One of them is the time it takes to grow.
Every time you go through two or three classes, <cf>dramatic growth becomes less likely.
This has been an issue for me for many years.
I have been giving it a lot of thought. ...... <cf>I have recently come up with a solution.
I'm sure it will help you too.
[I would not want to tell you how to do it. <cf> It is also a means with a somewhat stronger effect.
<cf> Is it powerful enough for you to use? <cf>I promised you that I would be the judge of that.
<cf>The challenge is the "Rush Battle, 3rd level. <cf>I hope you will succeed in breaking through it.
I will tell you the details after that. <cf>I wish you good luck.
<cf>I want you to challenge "Rush Battle 3-dan" and break through this!
If you have the strength to do so, <cf>you are well qualified to use the solution I have devised.
I will tell you the details after we get through the Rush Battle. <cf>I wish you good luck in your military endeavors.
It was brilliant. <cf>I have witnessed your battle.
Now let's talk about <cf>means to help your class grow!
Recently, in cooperation with the Pioneer Bureau and Memory Stand, <cf>a new liquid memory has been created.
This new liquid memory has the <cf>effect of increasing the experience gained at lower levels.
With this, you can expect<cf>quick growth even if you try out a new class!
Of course, the effect does not last forever. <cf>until you have achieved a certain level of growth.
Nevertheless, I think it would be a <cf>great help<cf> to expand your range of classes and fighting styles!
After this, you can try going to the memory stand. <cf>You should be able to choose a liquid memory.
Due to its high effectiveness, it is a strain on the body and mind. <cf>This liquid memory is not recommended for everyone.
We have tested its power on you, and that is why. <cf> I hope you will make good use of it and get to know the various classes.
Liquid Memory for class changes. <cf>There are many others that could help you.
Don't get caught up in one thing, broaden your horizons. <cf>Trying a wide range of things can be fun.
It's also a necessary attitude to reach for the heights.
As adventurers, we are often asked for <cf> unusual items.
Grass, stones, and many other things that are <cf>not</cf> sold in the stores I go to. ......
Let's see, next is "rough crystals"<cf>....... <cf>Do you carry this in your jewelry?
Have a nice day. <cf>My name is Marguerite, a new adventurer.
Actually, I would like to discuss a request that I have accepted.
I've been asked to collect <cf>materials</cf> called "crystal gemstones" and "glaucun seeds. ......
I've looked everywhere, but I can't find them, and I'm at a loss.
My family is descended from a noble family. It has been our family tradition for generations to become adventurers and <cf>expand our horizons</cf>.
Perhaps that is why the contacts I have made are not related to adventurers, and <cf> cannot help me with this request.
For example, I asked a friend of mine to order a rough crystal for me, <cf> but he said that it was not jewelry, but a material used for weapons.
<cf>Because it is not a gemstone, but a material used for weapons, <cf>the jewelry stores do not carry it.
<cf>I have never heard of "Glaucun Seed", neither for eating nor for ornamental use.
That's why I'm asking you, my senior, to gather the materials for me.
Of course, I will continue to look for them. <cf>But that would keep the client waiting.
Our first priority is to deliver the materials. <cf>Please cooperate with us.
<cf>Three "crystal gemstones" and two "Gloken Seeds". <cf>That should be enough for your request.
Thank you very much. <cf>I will consult with the Pioneering Bureau as well.
<cf>The request is for three "crystal gemstones" and two "glaucun seeds.
I will continue to search for them, but <cf>I am ashamed to say that it will take a long time.
Our first priority is to deliver them to the client. <cf>Please cooperate!
<cf>You have collected "crystal gemstones" and "glokenseeds", <cf> I see. Thank you very much.
This will save the client from waiting. <cf>Thank you again!
I also consulted with the Pioneering Bureau and <cf>heard an interesting story.
<cf>The Pioneer Bureau is going to start a "Mounted Caravan" program.
First of all, requests to borrow Mount Imagine will be collected at the Pioneering Bureau.
Once an adventurer registers his/her Mount Imagine, <cf>they will be dispatched to the request.
Then all they have to do is wait and the request will be completed and <cf>they can get the materials etc.</cf>.
The more Mount Imagine you have, <cf> the more places and requests you can be dispatched to, the better off you will be!
The Pioneer Bureau will be responsible for managing these items.
You can rest assured that your Mounted Imagine will not become unusable or wear out.
The Pioneer Bureau has also asked us to <cf>actively utilize the Mounted Caravan</cf>.
I don't have any mounted imagines yet, but <cf>when they become available, I would definitely like to make use of them.
<cf>I might have been able to solve this request on my own if I had <cf>Mount Caravan</cf>.
Today was a very fruitful day for me. <cf>Thank you so much!
I will continue to be diligent. <cf>I wish you a good journey.
<cf>In order to use "Mounted Caravan", you must have Mount Imagine.
You already have one, and if you have more than one, <cf>I recommend that you make good use of them.
I need to find the first one. <cf>Is it possible to order it from some store?
My friend has asked me to do so, <cf>I'm working on a new magic trick.
[I'm not sure if I should go with the <cf>explosion type or the disconnection type: ......
Hmmm, I'm torn! <cf>This is no time for work!
Welcome, adventurer! <cf>First of all, look here.
Here is a single weapon.
Just one weapon is ......<span size="Big">Hmph! </>
It can be easily broken like this!
However!　This three-weapon engram. <cf>When you combine them into one ......?
Like this! <cf>Wow, three arms in one weapon!
This makes it easy to take down even the nastiest mook scout! <cf>And more ...... humph!
As you can see, it disappeared without a trace!
Alright, it worked!　It worked! <cf>How was my new vanishing magic?
I am Ranveil, the genius magician and engineer of the Imagine Institute!
My friend Huovi asked me to do this for him. <cf>I was inventing a new magic trick!
I have fulfilled my promise to my friend! <cf>Here is my request to you.
Actually, my colleague also asked me <cf> to defeat the Mook Scouts.
The weapon I brought with me was broken or vanished by the magic I just used.
Even though it was vanishing magic, I never thought it would really disappear. <cf>My natural talent, I'm afraid ......!
Yet, it would be reckless to attempt the challenge without a weapon. <cf>Therefore, I ask you, adventurer, to take it down.
Of course, we will pay you. <cf>Yes!　I'll also tell you about the magic trick I mentioned earlier.
<cf>That was an application of a technique called "breaking through the limits. <cf> In the way of collecting multiple weapons and strengthening them.
It will be useful for you, the adventurer! <cf>So, I'll leave you to defeat them!
<cf>I'll take care of the weapons while I'm at it. <cf>After thinking about it, they were borrowed from a colleague of mine.
<cf>To the "free exploration of the forest road through the trees", please go. <cf>The target Mook Scout should be there.
Greetings, adventurer! <cf>Don't you disappear like magic!
The target Mook Scout should be found in <cf>"Free Exploration of the Forest Road through the Trees"!
<cf>You, the adventurer, will be able to take them down. <cf>I'll give you a decent reward, so please do me a favor.
Now, I must deal with the missing weapon. <cf>No, can't you use some ...... magic to get it out of somewhere?
Oh, adventurer! <cf> I see you've taken down a Mook Scout.
No, thank you. Thank you, my benefactor!
My friend Huovi told me about it. <cf>The weapon you broke was an expensive one.
[It takes a lot of time to make a new one, doesn't it? <cf>Wouldn't it be wiser to back out for a while? ["]]
[I decided to follow my friend's advice and go on a trip <cf>until things cool down</cf>!
Oops, but first, a promise! <cf>I will reveal the magic trick I just showed you!
<span size="Big">Yes!　It's called "Pushing the Limits"! </>
<cf>Breaking the Limit</cf> is a method of enhancing the same weapon or Imagine by stacking them on top of each other.
First, select the weapon or Imagine you wish to enhance, and <cf>prepare the same one</cf>.
Don't forget to bring the auxiliary materials for the "Limit Breakthrough"!
You can <cf>"push the limits" for weapons at the Tenshi Kneading Ritual, and for Imagine, at the Imagine Laboratory.
If you succeed, you can use the weapon or imagine that you have stacked up to <cf>strengthen</cf> the item you are aiming for.
Sometimes it may fail. The auxiliary materials will be lost, but the <cf>weapons and Imagines will remain, so don't worry!
In the case of my magic, it's only <cf> gone because I broke it normally. Hahaha!
If you 'push the limits', it makes sense to <cf>craft the same weapon or Imagine!
You might even get a weapon or other item during your adventure. <cf> Consider yourself lucky!
Now, it's time to disappear. <cf>I haven't seen you or talked to you!　Okay?
[--]Then you'll meet and talk to me, won't you?
<span size="Big">That voice! </> My friend's sister, Poirier!
I had a bad feeling because you were slow to return. <cf> Lanvale. How did you get the kill I asked you to do?
No problem. <cf>My grateful adventurers have done it!
And the weapon I lent him?
It fell victim to my new magic! <cf> Oh, I've got the broken remnants right here!
<span size="Big">..................</>
You hey ......!　How many of those do you get every time! <cf>How much do you think that weird hobby costs!
Wait a minute! <cf>Would you like to see my magic before we talk?
The magic that makes you disappear?
<span size="Big">Yes! </>
You know where you're going, you must be in the reflection room of the institute! <cf>Pick up the wreckage there and come quickly!
My friend's sister is very strict.
I'm going to be locked up in the institute, <cf>doing cleaning and other chores!
It can't be helped. ...... <cf>Let's work on a new piece of escape magic!
I, Ciri, apprentice restorer of Buffalia's heritage. <cf>I'm inspecting the rolling ball kneading ritual right now.
I took a quick look at it, and <cf>the lubricant in the internal mechanism is about to run out.
But, you know, it looks like the amount I can buy with the budget I have<cf> isn't going to be enough.
What?　Can we add more to the budget? <cf>No, no, no, no, don't poke that sore spot.
It hurts because <cf>the apprentice has such a complicated legacy to ...... in the first place!　It hurts!
Because it can't be helped. <cf>Would you like to try ["]trying? ["] because he told me to.
["]I can afford it!　I can afford it! I'll clean it up for half the usual price.
Wow!　Don't be stunned! <cf>I just wanted to show off a little!
Don't worry. I've thought of a countermeasure. <cf>We use "heat plants" that grow in the desert.
It has almost the same ingredients as lubricant. <cf>Surprising, isn't it?
I haven't had a lot of money for a long time,<cf> so I've tried a lot of different things for research material.
<cf>I can get by with 10 bottles for the time being. <cf>In the meantime, I'll get you a proper lubricant.
I can't tell Master ......, so I'll have to do some sneaky<cf>work to make up for it.
Anyway, if this stops, we're all in trouble. <cf>I have to make sure that doesn't happen.
Please!　Right? <cf>Thank you!
<cf>"Heat plants" that can replace lubricants are growing in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>.
I need you to gather some for me. <cf>Please!　Thanks for your help!
Hmph. ....... <cf>No problem, no problem. I'm a good woman for the job.
This sweating is because of the heat. Don't get me wrong. <cf>I'm not in a cold sweat or anything like that.
No, you know what? <cf>I was messing around with the rolling ball training ritual while I was waiting.
<span size="Big">Bang! </> I heard a nice sound. That's another one.
And when I looked at it, I found that some of the precision parts were <cf>really damaged</cf>.
I guess it wasn't something an apprentice should <cf>touch in earnest!
Oh, man!　I could have easily done that to a car. <cf>Sucks!
You brought me a heat plant, but <cf>this thing will stop even if I just have lube. Sorry!
I wasn't messing with it out of curiosity! <cf>I know that's an excuse, but I have a reason.
<cf>Salamuzat has a dry climate, so sand often gets in and breaks the legacy.
So I thought I'd clean it while I'm at it: ....... <cf>But my arms weren't good enough......
...... Oh! <cf>Yes. Master's notes!
He gave me ["]take it with you just in case["]! <cf>There might be something in this.
...... found it!　<cf>"<value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>" to find the damaged "Planetary Gear"!
Um, I'm sorry, but can I ask ......<cf> for this one as well?
According to the master's notes: ......
It seems that "Planetary Gear" is dropped by <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E024_00_00_00_02001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>".
Without it, it looks very bad ....... <cf>Please!　No, please!
The new "Planetary Gear"!　Thank you! <cf>I'll replace it right away.
...... Okay, replacement complete. <cf>Now we're good to go. Ha, thank goodness!
Now I can report to my master that ["]it was a piece of cake["]. <cf>I'll just say that I didn't have any trouble with ......
Well, you know what? <cf>Would you please keep quiet if I ever meet Master?
He is a very good restorer. <cf>So, if I'm not as good as him, I'll, uh, I'll, uh... ......
......I'm going to be honest with you, <cf>I don't want him to think I'm a bad guy!
Because he's my idol. <cf>I know he's sloppy sometimes and a dull uncle.
<cf>But he's so cool when he's restoring the legacy! <cf>There are so many other nice things about him!
<cf>I don't want to lose my other apprentices. <cf>I'm the only one who knows what's good about you. ......
So, you know?　Please, don't tell anyone!　Please don't tell anyone! <cf>Please for the rest of my life~!
...... Did you nod?　Did you just nod reluctantly? <cf>That means it's OK, right?
Thank goodness~!　Thanks! <cf> for covering my pokers.
If you ever bring in a legacy,<cf> I'll sneak you a discount.
He said it's ok. <cf>I'll be a really good business woman soon!
I'm Remigio, the future great merchant! <cf>It wouldn't hurt to ingratiate myself with you!
No ...... sorry, I apologize. <cf>It's not good to get carried away like this.
Actually, I lied to people to make myself look good. <cf>I owe you an apology for that.
But I just can't find the courage to do so. ......
<cf>The person I'm talking to is Dr. Sai in Lalpar. <cf>He sometimes teaches me at the mansion.
He is a very strict and scary man! <cf>I don't want to get close to him if I can help it.
If he doesn't apologize for this, I'll be even more afraid of him. ......
If someone can come with me, <cf>I'll try to do my best somehow!　I think ......
Please, come with me and apologize to Dr. Rhino! <cf>And please keep an eye on me so I don't run away!
I'll apologize properly too! <cf>Please share your courage and strength with me!
<cf>Please share your courage and strength with me! <cf>Please. Please apologize with me.
I must ask for forgiveness with the utmost apology. ...... <cf>I guess I'm still 'down on my knees'. ......
Hmm?　Mr. Remigio and Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
You seem to have something to tell me. ...... <cf>Mr. Remigio. Don't you have something to do first?
My apologies!　Dr. Sai!
That was Mr. Remigio of Salamzato, wasn't it? <cf>Well, what are we talking about?
The story I told you the other day when I came here with my father about <cf>[getting] married[,]" is a lie!
I didn't want to be treated like a child, so I just ....... <cf>[[I'm an adult]][I'm getting married soon]]
That was a lie! <cf>I am so sorry!
[<cf>Everyone wants to make themselves look big. <cf>Even adults often put on airs.
<cf>Moreover, you are still a child. <cf>You may want to grow taller at times.
[But lying is unimpressive.
<span size="Big">Hiiiii! </>
However, it's good that you came to apologize yourself.
I also apologize to the adventurers who bowed with me. <cf>Be careful from now on. No further questions will be asked.
Thank you very much for ......!
Thank you very much! <cf>I owe Dr. Sai an apology, thanks to you.
Mr. Remigio. I am fine with this, but <cf>isn't there one more person you owe an apology to?
It seems that the lie you told is <cf>more widespread than you think.
I'm sure that "marriage partner" is also <cf>troubled by it.
Eeeeeeeeeee! <cf> That lie to someone other than the teacher!
What shall I do? The person I said I'm getting married to is <cf>Mr. Isial of Asterlys.
If this lie is spreading, <cf>I have to apologize to Mr. Isial too!
Ahhh, but what can I say ......! <cf>...... sorry. Will you apologize with me again?
I feel like I can apologize properly if you're with me! <cf>Let's hurry up and go to Asterlys!
Mr. Remigio's lies seem to be<cf>more widespread than I thought.
I heard that you told Lord Isial of Asterlys that you were married to him.
You should apologize to Lord Isial as well. <cf>Madam Adventurer. I would like you to escort him.
Hah ....... <cf>Who in the world started all this talk about me getting married?
Oh, Mr. Remigio?　And you, adventurer. <cf> What can I do for you?
Mr. Isial!　Sorry!
What, Mr. Remigio? <cf>What on earth are you talking about?
I heard <cf>that the lie about me marrying Mr. Isial is spreading. ......
Sorry to bother you!
Ah! <cf>That was a lie you told me!
No wonder I thought it was strange. <cf>I've been told ["]congratulations on your marriage["] all over the place.
<cf>I was told to introduce my father to the man I was going to marry, even though I had absolutely no knowledge of it! I had no idea what was going on, but I was told by my father to ["]introduce him to the man I was going to marry!
It was a very difficult time for me, you know.
Did that even happen?
I'm really sorry! <cf>I didn't think it would cause such a fuss.
When I came here before, you were so kind to me, <cf>I just mentioned your name, Mr. Isial: ......
So that's what you meant. <cf>Okay. That's enough.
I'm sure we can clear up the misunderstanding if we talk about it properly. <cf>But please don't do it again!
I won't do it again!
<cf>I don't want to apologize, but <cf>I'll explain it to your father!
It's going to complicate things, so <cf>that's fine, <cf> but ......
Yes, I know. Would you <cf>return</cf> the present I received from Yuska?
He's a boy who loves books, and I talk to him a lot. <cf>The other day, he gave me a gift on short notice.
I'm sure he heard Remigio's lie somewhere and <cf>believed it.
But, Yuska, he hasn't come to visit me <cf>even once since then.
When I saw him the other day, he had a gloomy look on his face. <cf>I'd like you to talk to me if you have any problems.
Well, that's not good. ...... I feel like I <cf>hurt that Yuska so much!
I need to return the gift to Mr. Isial and <cf>explain things properly from me!
...... I also need to apologize, yes. <cf>Sorry. Please hang out with me a little longer!
Please <cf>return</cf> the gift you received from Mr. Yuska!
Please tell him the truth too. <cf>Because he should be in Asterlys.
Haha ....... <cf>Isial, you're getting married......
I'm shocked. ...... <cf>It's hard to go to the pioneer station now.
Oh, adventurer. Hello. ...... <cf>Do you have something for me?
Huh?　This is the ...... that I gave to Mr. Isial.
Sorry about that!
The story about Mr. Isial getting married was a lie that <cf>I</cf> told!
As such, I stand corrected and apologize!
Oh, it was a lie!
...... But, yeah. <cf>Mr. Isial isn't getting married. Good.
I'm sorry you got in trouble for my lie. <cf>I'm sorry I even got you a present!
That's fine. <cf>Many of the girls have been very kind to Mr. Isial.
We were just talking about celebrating together. <cf>I'm just now getting ready for the party.
I think we should tell them the truth too.
You're talking big here, too! <cf>No, we have to stop this now!
Let's find a venue to set up the party! <cf>I have to find it fast and apologize!
...... if we don't apologize, right? ...... right? <cf>Please, bow down with me!
We're celebrating Isial's wedding and <cf>we're all getting ready for the party!
I think you should tell her the truth and <cf>apologize to her as soon as possible!
How wonderful that Mr. Isial is getting married. <cf>We should celebrate it in a big way!
I can't wait to see you get married! <cf>I wonder what kind of man he's with.
<span size="Big">Sorry! </>
Wow!　Who's that!
Mr. Isial doesn't get married! <cf>That was a lie I told!
I just wanted to be a little taller <cf>I was just putting words in your mouth. ......
I'm sorry I went to all the trouble of preparing you for this! <cf>It's all my fault for lying!
Nah. That was a lie, wasn't it?
You're right, I didn't <cf>hear it directly from Mr. Isial, but...
<cf>I'm so disturbed. <cf>I was so excited to see the bride.
But I'm glad you told me before it started.
My sincere apologies ....... <cf>I'm sorry.
That's enough. Don't mind me so much.
Surprise me with a true story this time.
Ahhhh!　I'm not going to look good anymore! <cf> I'm just a kid and I'm not getting married!
I'm really sorry I put you through that too! <cf>I'm sorry you had to go along with my lies!
You've just come to the right place. <cf>Sorry. Just one more job, please.
Oh, no, this is embarrassing.
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>and I'm dealing with <cf>the Landhawk, and out of the blue he comes down.
He took my weapons. <cf>See, they like shiny things, don't they?
It made it impossible for me to do what I was asking. <cf>I was collecting <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>'s triangular scales.
I need five more. <cf>I need you to take them over.
When you're done, put them all together and deliver them to <cf>Isial in Salamzat.
He should be near the pioneer station. <cf>The client is at the pioneer station. What did he say: ......
I touched the [tip (Senitan)] of ["]<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, but <cf> it doesn't work, so I need you to collect the scales ["]......, was it?
I don't know, but you want me to <cf> punish them for not listening to you, maybe.
I'm asking you to do it then. <cf>You can have all the rewards.
I need 5 more <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/> triangular scales.
[I need you to collect the scales because touching the tip of the [<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/> doesn't <cf> work.
My client, Isial, said something like that. <cf> I don't know how many times I remember, but I don't know what it means. ......
Well, we know what we're going to collect, <cf>we'll just have to teach him a lesson and he'll be fine.
Oh, and by the way, if you <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>I'm inhabiting "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"
Isial is at the pioneer station, so when you're done <cf>deliver it all together.
Wow~......I've heard about it,<cf> but it's a really hot town!
The books get sunburned too. ...... <cf>We'll go back to Asterlys as soon as we're done with the research.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
......Do you want to deliver <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>'s triangular scales" on behalf of Mr. Durga?
Thank you for that. <cf>Yes, I did indeed receive it.
Eh?　Do you want to ask about the request?
Because <cf> touching the [tip(sentan)] of ["]<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/> doesn't work ["]......?
Oh, is that what Mr. Durga said? <cf> Oh my god, that guy. ......
I explained that ["]<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/> may <cf>have an organ that [detects] [living organisms],"].
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/> can accurately locate prey in the ground, in the dark, and in other places where <cf>visibility is poor.
It is hypothesized that this is because they have special organs for detecting living organisms that are separate from their <cf>eyes and ears.
I was thinking of conducting research based on this hypothesis. <cf>That's why I asked you to collect research materials.
Hopefully, we may be able to apply this technology to detecting and<cf>distracting monsters.
Once again, thank you for your cooperation!
Oh, yes. Excuse me. <cf> May I ask you one more thing?
I'd like you to go back to the Hermit's Fountain and check on <cf>Ms. Durga.
She's a bit of a dangerous person. <cf>I'm worried that she's doing something reckless.
Just let me know that the request has been completed, and I'll be fine. <cf>Thank you.
Could you please go back to "Hermit's Fountain" and check on <cf>Mr. Durga.
Just let me know that the request has been completed and I'll be fine. <cf>Thank you.
Ze ...... ze ....... <cf>Oh, what the ....... You're back.
Looks like you've gathered the "<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>'s triangular scales. <cf>Thank you. I appreciate it.
Me?　I just now got into Landhawk's lair and <cf>retrieved</cf> his weapon.
It's not nice to get beat up all the time, is it? <cf> I thought I'd show you how scary the humans can be.
Did Isial say anything? <cf> What?　<cf> "Kikan to tanch seitai ......"?
I don't know, but you <cf>did</cf> get what you asked for, didn't you?　Well, that's good....
I'll leave the hard stuff to the pioneering bureau and you. <cf>I'm in charge of the heavy lifting.
<cf>I'm in charge of the arms. <cf>Next time, I'll lend you my strength.
Let's help each other as adventurers. <cf>Thank you then!
Ohhhhhh... ......!　I'm screwed. ...... <cf>It's over!
Ha!　You're ...... the savior! <cf> Thank God!　God didn't abandon me!
I'm Carrion. <cf> I'm a rookie Buffalian guard.
<cf>There's a Buffalian ruin near here called "The Soundless City". Do you know it?
There was a cave-in accident there a while ago. <cf>And then the monsters started showing up.
Recently, there have even been strange rumors about seeing avaritas.
Then, because everyone was worried, <cf>the captain gave a reckless order!
[In order to stabilize people's minds, we will exterminate vermin! <cf> Each of you, take down <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>! [I'm not coming back until it's done!
I'm not supposed to come back until it's done! <cf>What do you want a rookie like me to do?
<cf>I can't just go along with my coworkers because there's a quota set for each of us. ......
<cf>I had no choice but to ask the adventurers for help! <cf>Please, join me in defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Oh, I'll go with you, but <cf>I don't think I'll be of any help. Sorry.
I'll just pretend you're not here. <cf>At least I'll hide so I don't drag you down.
Come back here when you've taken down the required number. <cf>I'll report back to the captain and let him finish.
The quota the captain gave me was to kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_00_01001"/>10 of them in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>.
I'll follow you, but I'll stay hidden and watch. <cf>After you kill the required number, come back here.
I'm so glad to have a savior like you!
Dear Captain!　We have <cf>finished defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_00_01001"/>!
What, you've already finished? <cf>You're not so bad. Carrion!
Hmm?　Who's that? <cf> I told you to take him down alone.
Surely you didn't ask an adventurer to help you, a Buffalian guard?
What?　Well, you see, ...... this is...
and this is the <cf>adventurer</cf> we protected in the course of the defeat mission!
(Sorry!　(Sorry! I'd be absolutely furious if I told you <cf> I asked him to help me. Get with the story!)
It is my natural duty as a <cf>guard</cf> to help those in danger!
Mm!　You know exactly what you're talking about. <cf>All right. Now for your next assignment.
What?　There's more?
Of course. That's not enough to make people feel safe. <cf>Next is to take down the bandit gangs that have been appearing in the neighborhood.
They are different from <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>. <cf> They're a nasty bunch of guys who work together in groups.
But they are the guards of the glorious Buffalia. <cf>We must not fall behind the bandits!
Yes, it is. What about you? <cf> I'd be safer here.
Oh, adventurer!　I will teach you how the Buffalian Guard fights, and you can watch!
<cf>You'll be safe, I guarantee it! <cf>Leave it to me, hahaha!
（<cf>Come with me!)
Well, that's good thinking. Carrion! <cf> Show the Buffalian Guard your full strength!
You too, adventurer, learn a great deal. <cf> I'm counting on you!　(Sorry!
(Sorry!　Will you come with me again?)
（Next, we'll take down the <cf> <value type="enemyName" id="E300_01_00_01001"/> that's hanging around in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>.)
(Please!　Help me!)
Ta, captain-dono ....... Geez, ....... <cf>The defeat of the bandits, it is finished. ......
What?　You're back already? <cf>You're the first one back again, Carrion.
Sorry, I have to go on an urgent mission. <cf>In return, I have something good for you as a reward.
<cf> Read the sealed letter there. <cf>Only you have the right to read it.
No one else is privy to it. ...... <cf>Good. Then I'll leave the rest to you!
Oh, boy, you. Thank you! <cf> You kept those bandits at bay.
I'll never be able to beat those guys. <cf>Adventurers are awesome!
By the way, the captain said something about a reward. <cf>I wonder if he meant this sealed letter?
Only we can read it! <cf>That's kind of exciting. Let's see... ......
<cf> Well done! <cf> Well done!　You shall be honored.
'The next assignment is yours alone. <cf> <cf> <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/> ASAP!
<cf> "There are some very dangerous monsters in the innermost part. <cf> This mission can only be entrusted to the best guards.
"On that note, the first one back should have no problem!
'<cf> Prove your ability and show that you are proud to be a Buffalian Guard!
'I cannot accompany you, but this is also my destiny. <cf> I cannot accompany you, but this is also my destiny!　You who came back first!
Your reward is ...... this super tough mission? <cf> The first one back is ...... me?
...... Let's pretend we didn't see it!　Let's pretend we didn't see it! <cf>Not that you know anything about it either!　You don't know anything about it either. ......
Huh?　Carrion?
Damn, you beat me to it. <cf> You did it, coming back first!
Hmm?　What's that? Is that a written order? <cf> "Duty only to the first to return." ......?
That's great, Carrion! <cf> You're the one the captain wants to see!
<cf>Only the first one back gets the mission? <cf> Kuuuhhh, that's cool!
<cf>Good luck with that! <cf>I'm sure you'll do great!
Ah ha ...... ah ha ha ha ......
Kiku, kiddo! <cf>You're coming with me, right?　Hey!
Please!　Please! <cf>Please help me~!
One, the next one is '<value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>'. ...... <cf>I mean go to the deepest part.
That's where <cf>they're rumored<cf> to have seen Avaritia. ......
O Savior!　Please help us~!
Well done, Carrion! <cf>A wonderful achievement for a newcomer!
I'm back safe and sound!
You really are amazing! <cf>I even made it to <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>!
I did the best I could, too. <cf>As you can see, I didn't get hurt at all!
Isn't that amazing after all that fighting? <cf>I kept dodging them all to avoid getting hit!
What the heck?　You make it sound like our adventurers <cf>fought with arrows!
No, that can't be right! <cf> No way, a Buffalian guard!
Yes, that's right, Captain! <cf>No, I don't think so, ha ha ha!
<cf> No, indeed! It's great to see you back here without a scratch. <cf> I guess you can still fight to your heart's content.
<cf>Well, we'll be off soon! <cf>Next opponent is an ogre. Get fired up!
Oh no. <cf>...... you're kidding, right?
I don't have time for jokes. <cf>We've been looking forward to a good guard like you!
Let's go!　You are the rising star of our troop! <cf>Let's see what you can do!
No, no, no, no! <cf>Wait a minute!
...... Well, adventurers. <cf> My men have taken care of you.
<cf>Well, I have a pretty good idea what's going on. <cf>You saved Carrion.
On behalf of the garrison, I thank you.
He must be trained to be a great guard. <cf>I would like to ask for your help again, if you don't mind.
Oh, adventurer. <cf> Are you grateful to the gods of Buffaria?
Huh?　I don't look like a priest to you? <cf> Hahaha!　I get that a lot.
<cf> I'm born with a mouth and an attitude. <cf>I'm what you call a bad priest.
<cf>The big guys even scowl at me for defiling the dignity of the temple and all that.
<cf>Well, I don't really care! <cf>Thanks to them, they don't complain about me hanging around.
Do you know a priest called Panayote?
He's a friend of the common people. <cf>He listens to what we ask him to do.
<cf>He's a nice guy, but he gets caught up with a lot of work.
Adventurer, you can help him out if you like.
If you see a priest named Panayote, <cf>call out to him.
Oh, I'm Panayote. <cf> I'm a priest of the Buffalian faith.
Hmm?　What is it? <cf> Did a merchant ask you to help me?
That's very kind of you! <cf>The gods will be pleased.
I've got some temple chores to take care of.
Would you like to come along with me?
I'm often sent from place to place. <cf>I pick up trash when I'm there.
It's more useful to people than giving them a pungent sermon, isn't it?
I especially like to keep the streets clean outside of town. <cf>It's a place where merchants, pilgrims, and travelers all pass through.
But recently the number of monsters has been increasing, and it's getting dangerous.
That's where you come in. <cf>Please escort me and help me pick up trash.
Today I thought I'd <cf>walk between Salamzat and <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>.
It's mostly desert and roadless. <cf>But people pass by sometimes, so I can't leave it alone.
I'm sure we'll find trash along the way, so let's <cf>pick it up and head for "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>".
What I'm asking you to do is.
<cf> escort between Salamzat and "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" and help pick up trash.
Let's aim for <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/> while picking up trash!
We found trash right away. <cf>Someone's leftovers. Pieces of meat and vegetable scraps.
<cf>Monsters are attracted to garbage like this.
They're desperate to survive. <cf>Even this garbage is a feast.
But we want to be safe on the road too. <cf>That's why picking up trash is an important part of the job.
<cf>But you should at least clean up after yourself. <cf>At this rate, we're going to find more trash.
<cf>Let's keep going and see if we can find any more trash.
This guy is a piece of glass. <cf>This is a surprisingly messy piece of trash.
Glass reflects light and stands out. <cf>Some monsters are attracted to light.
Not only that, but it hurts when you step on it. <cf> I don't have to tell you that.
How about you? <cf>Oh, you're picking up a lot. Nice work.
Well, we're almost at "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"... ...... Hmm?
What the heck is that? I'm a little curious. <cf>I'll go ahead and check it out.
I'm a little curious about something. <cf>I'm going to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/> first.
Oh, thanks for coming. You're here.
I had a bad feeling about this, but I knew it. <cf>There's a big hole in the ground.
It would be troublesome if the carriage got stuck. <cf>If it's bad, people will fall in.
<cf>There are monsters in the desert that hide in the sand. <cf>It would be a big problem if it became a feeding ground for them!
Stop picking up trash. <cf> Let's just plug the hole, even if it's just a first aid kit.
I can do the work. <cf>You go find a sandstone.
It's a strange stone that attracts sand. <cf>If you put it down, it should fill the hole on its own.
<cf>Sandstones can be found in the desert. <cf>Five of them should be enough. I'm counting on you.
<cf> Sandstones can be found around here.
I'm counting on you, man.
I've been waiting for you. <cf>You brought the Sandstone.
Put it in the hole and fill in the surrounding area at ....... <cf>Oh, the sand is gathering right away.
Now all we have to do is reinforce it with a wooden frame and we're done. <cf>With the planks in place, it won't fall down.
<cf>That's good, that's a good first aid measure. <cf>That's a relief.
Thank you, that's great. <cf>Thank you on behalf of everyone who comes through here.
...... roads are great. <cf>They are essential for people to live.
People pass through it, things pass through it, and the city becomes richer. <cf>The roads are silently the cornerstone of that.
Picking up trash may be a small thing, but <cf>I'm going to give thanks to the road in this way.
<cf>There is nothing here now, but eventually a road will be built here.
<cf>When that happens, the people who pass through here won't know <cf>about us.
But I'm sure what we've done will help someone.
<cf>You will also walk down the road somewhere. <cf>When you do, think about it a little.
<cf> I'm preaching to the choir here! <cf>Wishing you safe travels and good luck. See you soon!
Well, I'm stumped. <cf> I'm sorry, that was a stupid thing I did.
<cf>I ordered the "Oni Nutmeyashi". <cf>I usually use Evergreen.
<cf>But the one that arrived was from Montenol. <cf>The grains were a little small.
<cf>This disappointed our customers. <cf>But even if I order them, they won't arrive today.
<cf>We need to get some from Evergreen somehow.
Ten "Oni Dates". <cf>Please hurry up. I asked for them!
The big ones can be found in the Evergreen Desert <cf><value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>.
I asked for the plumpest ones I could find!
Ah, the "devil date palm". <cf>They're from Evergreen for sure!
<cf>Thank you! <cf>These grains are great.
Sweet and nutritious. <cf>This is the best dessert for lunch!
Now it's my turn. <cf>Sell it, sell it, sell it!　Come on in!
<cf>I like to put unusual ingredients in my bento sometimes!
I'm sure there are some interesting things like the local cuisine of the Duchy of Barnhart.
Baboon baboon baboon baboon ....... <cf>No, no, no, I'm grateful to you, you know?
A shape-shifting drug that allows you to turn into someone else. <cf> Such a monstrosity is not easy to make.
Not without a good collaborator like you. <cf>Heehee, I'm looking forward to working with you again.
<cf>This time it's monster material. <cf>They're also very hard to find.
First, we need five chest hairs from <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>. It has to be <cf> chest hair. Be careful.
And five "<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> shin hairs". <cf> This one has to be shin hair, okay?
Why do I care about such maniacal hairs? <cf>...... I don't even know!
<cf>Well, what are we going to do, make a makeover potion? <cf>The ingredients will probably be crazy. Hee hee hee
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/> should come across <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> should be <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in the Montenol valley.
We need the hair of the people who live there. <cf>The climate and the quality of the engrams match, or something.
Ancient magic potions are wacky. <cf> Hee-hee-hee. Anyway, I'm counting on you.
All you need for the baboon...... makeover potion is
<cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/>" from <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>". 01_02001"/> five "<cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/> chest hairs
From <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in the Montenol Valley, <value type="enemyName" id E000_18_00_01001"/> from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>.
Nice to meet you. Baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
Baboon, good job. <cf> Looks like you got them successfully. Hee-hee-hee.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_01_02001"/> chest hair" and <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> shin hair"? baboon baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
I'm not sure which is which. Here.
Baboon, you're giving me a hard time at all. <cf> Still, we're making progress somehow.
Thanks to you, baboon. <cf>But I still need your help.
Don't worry. <cf>I'll make sure you get your share. Baboon.
Think about what you want to turn into when you're free. <cf>See you later. Baboon baboon......
baboon...... needs some troublesome materials.
I'll have to get it from the Duchy of Barnhart, but <cf>I wonder if there's anyone over there who has a connection with them, baboon......
Oh, Anta. Thanks for the help. <cf>Thanks for helping me out.
I'm trying<cf> various methods of manufacturing the 400 year old weapons I told you about.
The handiwork is not bad. But I didn't <cf>think</cf> I'd be using monster materials.
You're saying it's the same with crafting now? <cf>Yes, crafting uses a variety of materials.
But crafting only takes the engrams out of the material and puts them into the weapon, right?
The way I'm trying to do it is to modify the material and mix it with the <cf> ore.
It's time-consuming, but I've heard it makes the <cf>weapon stronger.
All you need is five [shimmon iron]. <cf>And five <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>[soft shells
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/> The shell is strong. <cf>Goblins sometimes use them as armor.
But not this time. <cf>I need the juice from boiling the soft shell.
<cf>I'm sorry I asked for the ore, too. <cf>You're welcome. <cf>Thank you.
What I need is <cf>"deep-iron" and "<value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>'s soft shell.
Deep iron" is a mineral that can be mined in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".
The "soft shell of <value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>" is the mineral found in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>" in <value type="enemyName" id="E013_ 01_00_01001"/> because you can get it from there.
I didn't expect to find <cf>monster material in a 400 year old weapon manufacturing process.
I've asked you to do a lot of things for me, but I'm counting on you.
Oh, you got it. <cf>"Deep pattern iron" and "<value type="enemyName" id="E013_01_00_01001"/>'s soft shell".
Indeed, I received it. <cf>That's what I'm talking about. I'm glad I asked you to do this for me.
At times like this, it's no good being unable to <cf>find a place to go if you can't socialize.
Well, let's give it a try right away. <cf>I didn't think I'd be taking the broth out of the boil.
Surprisingly, it might yield <cf>interesting weapons that can't be crafted!
I'll let you know when that happens. <cf>Thanks for your help. Thank you.
The method of making weapons 400 years ago: ....... <cf>There's still a lot we don't know.
Like ["]steel plate with the suppleness of muscle ["]....... <cf>They've got records, but how were they made?
I wish I had a sample somewhere. ......
Thanks for taking care of it. <cf>Thank you for your help.
Once again, <cf>I need you to take down some <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> around here.
Sometimes they come close to the mines and <cf>attack our craftsmen.
My husband used to get hit by them too. <cf>Well, he was young.
<cf>Well, he was young, so he went on a rampage with a pickaxe in his hand and drove everyone away.
Since then, we have taken measures to prevent <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>from <cf>coming</value> to our mine.
I really wish they would all <cf>disappear</cf>.
But then there would be too many beasts.
So, not too many, not too few. <cf>I'm trying to adjust by taking down a certain number of them on a regular basis.
Now, let's get started. <cf>First, I'd like 10 <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>.
I'll keep the list here. <cf>Come back and report back to me when you're done.
<cf>I want you to kill 10 <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> around here.
Please come back and report back to me when you're done. <cf>Thanks for your help.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> with 10 kills ....... <cf>Okay, no problem.
Thanks a lot. <cf>Did I take rather a long time?　Not really?
You have to be a local to get lost. <cf>It's just so convoluted around here.
Oh well. <cf>It would be a piece of cake if my son had stayed in the area.
I used to ask my son Einar to help me. <cf>He's a strong man like ours.
<cf>He knows how to do the work, and he's used to it, so it was easy.
<cf>I mustn't, mustn't, mustn't. <cf>I hate it when I get old and whiny.
I'm sorry. Shall we continue to defeat them? <cf>Next, I'll ask you to <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>.
This one has five kills. <cf>Good luck!
Next, I would like you to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>.
There will be five of them. <cf>Good luck!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> with five ....... <cf>Good. That's the number we need this time.
Good job!　You are indeed an adventurer. <cf>You're good at defeating monsters.
I'd love to have you back next time. <cf>Although it would actually be best if Einar came back.
I wanted that boy to take over our house. <cf>It seems the only ones who thought so were my parents.
'I'm going to make my living in the arts!　I want to be an actor!' <cf> And he ran away from home.
<cf> I didn't listen to them at the time, either. <cf>We had a big fight. I'm sorry about that.
<cf>When you see an actor acting recklessly with a monster, tell him to go home once in a while.
He would at least send me a letter, but he never comes home.
I just want to see him once in a while and tell him to hang in there.
You're very lucky! <cf>You're first in line.
Don't worry. It's a guaranteed money-making deal. <cf>I'll tell you something special.
My name is Garb. I'm a peddler. <cf>I go around and sell my wares.
<cf> I'm a peddler. <cf>I go around and hear all kinds of stories, anecdotes, and gossip.
<cf>Every place has its own business. <cf>The best merchants are the ones who know what they're doing and make money from it.
I've heard good stories in Litze, too. <cf>There is a fish that brings good luck.
It's called "kinryo". <cf>Oh, you know it?
I heard you couldn't catch it until a while ago. <cf> I saw them downstream the other day.
A school of striped bass!　There were so many of them!
<cf> If you catch them and sell them while you still can, yes, you can make a fortune! <cf> We'll make a killing!
What?　Have you been where the musclefish are before? <cf> Wait, wait, wait!　Don't tell me!
We've got to get there before they do. <cf>You can't tell anyone. Okay?
It takes two to catch 'em all. <cf> Come on, let's get going!
Catch some musclefish downstream and we'll make a killing!
We'll keep this story a secret from the others!
It takes two of us to catch them all. <cf>Let's hurry up and go!
Hugh!　That's a big catch! <cf>Look at that. The place is crawling with big-ass musclefish!
This is a good start. <cf> I see, it's a good omen!
I'll take advantage of it and make a big profit too! <cf>Let's go catch some striped bass!
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" Go around the river. <cf>When you've collected enough, let's go sell them to Litze!
<cf>If you look in the river at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>, you should be able to find <cf>"muscle fish.
Once we have a few, we can sell them to the residents of <cf>Litse</cf>!
Ah, there's a [muscle fish]!　That's a lot of fish. <cf> Did your uncle catch these?
Hey, boy. You've got a good eye. <cf> That's right. Fresh out of the water, fresh out of the water.
Would you like one? <cf> Fish must be eaten fresh.
What? <cf> Uncle, are you going to eat the stringy fish?
That's right. <cf>It's a good luck charm for Litze, right?
I'm not going to eat stringray fish. <cf>If you see one, it's a sign of a good catch, so it's a good omen.
The first person who sees it and tells the village about it <cf>is thanked by everyone for being a 'lucky man.'
So your uncle is a lucky man. <cf>But what are you going to do with that pile of stringy fish?
I don't think you should eat it. <cf> Shall I grill it for you to try?
Hey, I've got a bad feeling about this. ...... <cf>Since we're at it. I'll take one, please.
Hai. Then wait for me.
Sorry to keep you waiting. <cf>I've cut them up and grilled them with salt.
Thanks. <cf>It looks like it took you a long time. ......
Because it's a muscle fish. <cf>It's a lot of work just to get the knife in there.
Smells delicious. <cf>...... then, I'll have some!
Geez!　What the heck is this?
Is that a stone! <cf>The meat is stringy and tough and inedible!
I told you I don't eat them. <cf> Muscle fish are a mass of hard muscles all over!
I sometimes target them when mountain stream fishing, too,<cf> but if I catch one, I'll let them all go.
I can't bring them home to eat anyway. <cf>I can't even feed them to animals.
Uncle, you're bringing an awful lot of them with you, but <cf>I don't think anyone's going to buy them.
Oh my God. ....... <cf>That's the story behind it.
<cf>I should've asked the villagers instead of being so stingy about keeping it all for myself. ......
How about one for you? <cf>...... don't want one. I said I can't eat it.
Damn it!　Who the hell is this? <cf>Who stocked up on such a large amount!
...... It was me!　I'll take responsibility and eat it! <cf>God of Buffalia, I'll take it!
<span size="Big">Solid! </>
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>Thank you for the escort.
Actually, I have a girlfriend. <cf>We both love to travel and we've been all over the place.
<cf>She got a bad leg and couldn't travel anymore.
[There were still so many places we had promised to visit together.
So I want to use this Imagine of mine to bring back <cf>the scenery at least.
But since I just got this Imagine, I'm not sure if I can use it <cf>as well as I want.
I don't want it to fail to record the important parts, so <cf>I want to try it out on some local scenery first.
So...<cf>I'd like to try it out on some local scenery first. If I go to all this trouble, I'd like to record <cf> unusual places that are not usually seen, wouldn't you?
So I decided to climb a rocky mountain. <cf>We'll look down on the whole view of Litze from the top.
I'm sure we'll get some great views. <cf>Let's get going!
First, let's climb the "Litze Trading Route" rocky hill and <cf>look down on the whole of Litze!
You should be able to record some great views. <cf>Come on, let's get going!
Oh wow!　You can see the Litze pretty clearly. <cf>It's a sexy view. I can't get enough of it!
The world is beautiful ....... <cf>You know what I mean?
I'd love to collect a bunch of views like this to <cf>give</cf> to my girlfriend!
But it's strange to <cf>look over your hometown from above like this!
When I was a kid, I thought it was a big village, but <cf>as an adult, you see it differently.
I wish I'd never been able to beat her <cf>once in a running race.
...... Here we go. <cf> I've got a record of how Ritze is doing.
Yup. I can look back and <cf>imagine how to use it seems fine. Good.
Now we can get going in earnest. <cf>I'm planning on going to Salamzat next.
Did you know that there is a <cf>gateway</cf> on the road to the Evergreen Desert?
I wonder if I can ask for an escort to that point. <cf>After that, I'm thinking of using a riding coach.
I'd appreciate your company for a little while longer.
<cf>Could you escort us to the last barrier in the "Melissos River Valley"?
We're arriving! <cf>Well, I kind of feel the desert breeze.
It looks like it's almost time for the wagons to leave. <cf>There are some tough horses!　Let's record this one too!
Hmmm, fantastic!
Oh, I guess I startled you. <cf>Sorry about that.
But still, it seems like the streets are even more dangerous these days <cf>than they used to be!
When my girlfriend and I were traveling<cf>I think there were even fewer monsters.
I couldn't have made it here alone, so <cf>I'm glad you were with me.
If I find some good scenery in Salamzat,<cf>I may ask you to escort me again.
Also, I've heard many interesting stories about your travels.
I'll be sure to let you know if I hear any rumors<cf> about treasure or mysterious caves or anything like that.
Well, thank you very much! <cf>God bless you on your journey as well!
Hahaha! <cf>And here he is, after all!
The culprit always returns to the scene of the crime: ....... <cf>In other words, the culprit is you!　You are the one who did it!
<cf>Mr. ....... <cf>I thought this was a passing adventurer.
...... hahahaha!　Surprised? <cf>It's just a little detective joke, of course!
Sorry for the abruptness, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Master is currently investigating a case.
It is called "The Case of the Serial Camel Theft"! <cf>It's a mysterious case that's been making the rounds in Salamseat.
Today, as always, a new mystery calls to me: ....... <cf>Yes, the name of this great detective Guido!
And you, from now on, will be the great detective's assistant!
Assistant or not. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation, adventurer.
I'm sorry I'm late. <cf>My name is Cindy, and I serve Master Guido.
Recently, a number of camels belonging to a peddler in Salamzat have been stolen <cf> one after another.
The Master has asked me to find the culprits.
[--]I didn't receive any particular request. <cf>I stuck my neck out for myself.
Hahaha! <cf>All mysteries are meant to be revealed to me!
To be frank, sir, it's a straight line <cf>into the labyrinth alone, so please bear with me!
The crimes all took place in this city. <cf>Perhaps the culprit is hiding nearby.
The first step is to conduct interviews, the basis of the investigation. <cf>Gather testimonies from people in town.
Also take a look at the crime scene once. <cf>I'm sure there are clues that your husband missed.
Cindy and I and you will interview at another location. <cf>We will meet up later around the entrance to the city.
The basis of the investigation is to listen in. And then we'll examine the scene.
We'll gather testimonies from people in town and <cf>go to the back of the pioneer station where the incident took place.
We'll take another route to interview people too. <cf>Let's meet up around the entrance to the city later.
Hey, welcome! <cf>What?　You want to interview me about a case?
Ah, the camel thief. <cf>I just got one myself the other day.
<cf>I got hit by a huge gust of wind and a cloud of dust. <cf>When I opened my eyes, the camel was already gone.
It's funny though. <cf>How could it disappear from right in front of my eyes in an instant?
Catch the culprit as soon as you can. <cf>This ain't gonna buy me a new camel.
Huh?　You want to hear about the case? <cf> I didn't do anything.
Oh, you mean the camel thief? <cf> There's some kind of rumor going around.
I remember hearing about it from someone else too. <cf>They say the thief leaves a sign at the crime scene.
Well, what did they leave behind? <cf>I don't remember the details.
<cf>I don't remember the details, but it seems that they always leave something at the crime scene. <cf>Maybe you should check it out.
This is the scene of a string of camel thefts.
A large bird feather has fallen out. <cf>May be a clue to the culprit.
Let's show Guido.
Hou!　I'll do it. <cf>So you think you've found a clue to the killer?
The disappearing killer...... will always leave a sign....... <cf>And the feathers left at the scene......
...... Hmm, I see. <cf>So it looks like we have a picture of the culprit.
Perhaps the killer flies! <cf>Yes!　You've probably noticed it too.
This is the work of the legendary winged subhumans! <cf>No doubt!
Are these not the feathers of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>I found it in the souvenir shop!
I don't think it's that <cf>rare</cf> in Salamzaat!
Hahaha! <cf>Good point, Cindy.
People in town have been <cf>talking about seeing <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> a lot lately!
Speaking of which, it's almost spawning season. <cf>I guess you'll need to feed the chicks, too.
Mm-hmm. Perhaps <cf>they were catching camels as bait.
In other words, the culprit, or rather the offending bird is <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>! <cf>This is the truth behind the serial camel thefts!
......This is troubling. How do you think we can <cf>catch the culprits?
How about <cf>taking some measures to keep <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> away from the city!
If we can get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>, then <cf>the camels will not be caught!
Hahahaha! <cf>I was just thinking the same thing!
I have one secret plan. <cf>Let's take steps to keep them away from the city!
You take down the <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> and drive them out of <cf>the neighborhood!
I could go, but this is the right place for the right person. <cf>We should split up the brain work and the physical work.
The master is not good at fighting. <cf>On the contrary, you will end up as bait for <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>.
And there's no guarantee that the secret plan or whatever it is will work. <cf>My best regards, adventurers!
If we kill 10 birds, <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/> will sense the danger and <cf>stay away</cf>.
Adventurers, please kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>".
We will <cf>take steps to keep <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/>away from the city, so
Hey, welcome back. Looks like you got rid of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/>.
We've just finished the work here, too. <cf>No more <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> will be allowed near the city!
Did you know? <cf>Birds don't like big eyeballs!
So, I have set up a model of a floating eye <cf>close to the city!
I don't know if it really works, but <cf>as a result, the number of sightings has decreased!
I think it's thanks to our adventurers. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>Thank you for your efforts!
What do you say, Mr. Cindy? <cf>It's the effect of my respectful floating eye model!
I hope so, sir.
My assistant. <cf>With our help, the peace of the city has been preserved.
When another incident occurs, let us <cf>solve it together</cf>!
Hahaha! <cf>See you then. Adios!
<cf>Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you very much!
We have just crossed the desert to <cf>this</cf> city: ......
On the way, we were attacked by a horde of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/> and lost some of our <cf>goods.
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>have a habit of carrying off shiny objects. <cf>That's probably why they spotted the merchandise.
We will now send out a search party, but <cf>they are not experts at fighting.
So we need you adventurers to <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/><cf>get rid of them.
If you can kill some of them, it will distract the <cf>searchers</cf>.
Then we can find their nest and <cf>retrieve our merchandise.
Thank you very much. <cf>Please be careful.
We need you, adventurers, to <cf>drive out the <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/> of the <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>.
We will find the nest and get our goods back while we are at it. <cf>Please do so!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>Thank you for defeating it!
We have heard of your success from the search party. <cf>I am sure you did a wonderful job.
Thanks to you, we were able to <cf>recover our goods!
However, we still haven't <cf>found</cf> the gemstone called "Light of the Desert" at ......
That gem is not for sale. <cf>It is an heirloom given to us by the god of Buffalia.
'As long as you have this light, your journey through the desert will be protected. <cf> Therefore you must protect the light.'
'When it falls into the hands of the wicked, the light is lost. <cf> A terrible plague will be brought upon the desert.
This is how it has been handed down from generation to generation. <cf> We must bring back the "Light of the Desert" no matter what!
According to reports, traces of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/> were found in the vicinity of <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>'s nest.
The search party is to <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/> immediately to <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>'s lair!
Dear Adventurer. For the second time, I ask you to dismiss <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>.
We cannot afford to lose the "Light of the Desert". <cf>Please, please, please!
We cannot lose the "Light of the Desert" given to us by God.
Please <cf>please remove the <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/> of the <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>.
I will take back the "Light of the Desert" in the meantime. <cf>Please, please!
Dear adventurer! <cf>Thank you so, so much!
We were able to recover the "Light of the Desert" safely. <cf>It is all thanks to you, Mr. Adventurer!
Do you understand? <cf>The strong engrams in the jewelry.
This is the blessing of the God of Buffalia. <cf>The power to guide the waters of the desert and bring them into the hands of men.
Our family does business in many parts of the desert, and yet, strangely enough, water is the only thing that we have never had trouble with.
Perhaps the blessings of the God of Buffalia <cf> have protected us on our journey.
<cf>The light was protected and calamity averted. <cf>It is only with the help of our adventurers that we have been able to do this.
<cf>We will never forget this, along with the "Light of the Desert,"<cf> and pass it on to our descendants.
Thank you very much. <cf>May God bless you on your journey as well!
Hey, thanks for taking care of old Maaya sometime ago. <cf>You came to the right place this time too.
There's a big outbreak of <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> right now. <cf>I need your help to reduce the number.
I'm trying to prevent accidents, but <cf>I actually have a bit of a personal situation.
My son, Richter, <cf>is challenging me to a ritual.
It's a kind of test of skill, <cf>to kill <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>alone</value>.
Salamzat is now mostly merchants,<cf> but originally it was also a hunting village.
The hunters were respected <cf> for bringing in their daily bread from the harsh desert environment.
Because of this tradition, <cf>there are still challenges for young men who wish to become hunters.
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> and prove their strength.
But my son is not strong enough to take on a single one, much less a number of them.
I can't help him, but he could be in danger if left unchecked.
That's why I approached you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>and reduce their numbers.
I'm going to go hunt them down at another location. <cf>We'll meet back here when we're done.
I want you to reduce the number of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>.
I'm off to hunt them down at another location. <cf>When you're done, I'll meet you back at this place.
Thanks for your time. Thanks. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> seems to have decreased in number.
This will avoid any unforeseen problems. <cf>Wild animals can be an unexpected danger.
My son will have a little easier time fighting them. <cf>Oh, no. I didn't mean it that way.
Hmm, but ....... <cf> I'm still worried.
You. I'm sorry. <cf> I need you to do me one more favor.
I need you to check on my son. <cf> I was actually going to be there myself. ......
I'm a parental idiot, myself. <cf>I might lend a hand at an important moment.
I trust you in that regard. <cf> You'll be my witness to the ritual.
My son's name is Richter. <cf>I think he's around the "Dawn Bug Fortress".
...... Oh, yes. <cf>Don't tell my son about the <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>defeat.
It would be embarrassing if he thought I helped him early on. <cf>Sorry. I look forward to working with you.
I'm a parental figure. <cf>I might lend a hand if I were present.
I'm sorry, son, but I need you to be a witness to <cf>Rictor's</cf> ritual.
I think he'll be around the "Dawn Worm Fortress."<cf>Thank you.
Hello, adventurer. <cf>Yes. Rictor is me, though. ......
Eh?　My dad asked you to be <cf>witness</cf> to the hunter's ritual?
You said you were going to witness it yourself. ...... <cf> Ah, but I guess it was just as well.
<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> I already beat you. <cf>I've taken the fangs as proof of that, you see.
I just had a problem with it. ...... <cf>I lost the bow my father gave me.
I guess I was so selfless in the fight. ...... <cf>When I realized it was gone.
Of course I looked for it. <cf>But I saw the shadow of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> in the distance.
If I met him unarmed, I wouldn't be able to find my bow. ...... <cf>I was wondering what to do.
Adventurer. It's an important bow. <cf>Will you lend me your help?
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> and hunt <cf> them down and get rid of them around here.
Meanwhile I'll go look for my bow. <cf>Please let me join you back here later.
Could you <cf>purge the <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>?
In the meantime, I'll go find my lost bow. <cf>Please let me join you back here later.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Dad's bow, found!
Thanks to the adventurer for <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/><cf>distracting me!
I ...... swore by this bow. <cf>I'm going to be a great hunter like my dad.
My dad is a worrier and <cf>always worried about me, but I want to tell him that.
I want to tell him that. <cf>["]How about that?　Did you see that? ["]"]
I'm a full-fledged hunter too, so <cf>you can rest assured.
But I can't believe I dropped the all-important bow. <cf>I'm not ready for this.
It's embarrassing, so <cf>would you please don't tell my dad?
Well then, let's go back to Salamzaat. <cf>My dad will be waiting for me.
<cf>Don't tell my dad that I dropped my bow!
Oh, it's you. And Richter. <cf>How was the ritual?
My dad ....... <cf>How about that?　Did you see that?
I did it! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> I killed it all by myself!
Here, fangs in evidence!
I had the adventurers help me because <cf>that's a whole different thing!　It's true!
Richter......
Oh well. You've done it with flying colors. <cf>Then you're a full-fledged hunter now!
...... You've grown up.
Kids grow up before you know it, don't they? <cf>I'm uncharacteristically impressed.
You've been a great help to me. <cf>Thank you. <cf>I will never forget this debt of gratitude, father and son.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I will train harder and become a great hunter!
<cf>Next time, I hope I can help someone like you did, Mr. Adventurer!
I was taken care of during my apology round sometime ago!
Isial's celebration party was <cf> ruined by my lies. ......
I had no choice, so we all decided to have a <cf>party for no particular reason!
We got along kind of well because of it. <cf>It wasn't all bad, was it?
No, lying is bad! <cf>I'm sorry about that, I really am!
Hey, adventurer! <cf>Thanks for taking care of me sometime.
You apologized with me, and we <cf>came full circle. I'm sorry too.
Lying is still a bad idea! <cf>I'm going to live honestly from now on.
So. <cf>To be honest, <cf>I want something very badly right now!
It's a treasure called the "Testament of Courage".
My friends at school were bragging about it the other day. <cf>It was a piece of a very beautiful ruin!
His dad is an adventurer and he found it somewhere.
Damn ...... I'm jealous! <cf>I want a "proof of courage" too!
<cf>I want a token of courage too! <cf>I hear it's dangerous to get the "Proof of Courage".
<cf>I've been told to have an adventurer as my escort if I go.
Well, I'm just a kid. <cf>I don't blame them if that's the case.
Let's search around town first. <cf>There should be a butler, William, by the pioneer station.
He's gone ahead and done a preliminary search. <cf>Let's go talk to him.
I want a 'proof of courage' too! <cf>I want it so badly!
First we'll go to <cf>William, the butler, who's doing his homework.
He's near the pioneer station in Salamzert.
Here he comes, old man! <cf>I've hired adventurers as you asked.
This is the boy. <cf>We've been expecting you.
How do you do, adventurer? <cf>My name is William, the steward.
<cf>Mr. Remigio, you are a man who will one day stand on the shoulders of your house and your family.
<cf>Master thinks it would be a good idea for him to experience everything and gain insight.
I know I may be causing you trouble, but <cf>please bear with me to the end.
That's about all I have to say. <cf>Gee. Is there a "proof of courage" here?
<cf>Many people from the outside, such as adventurers and travelers, visit the Pioneer Station.
Some of them may have stopped by the ruins. <cf>There may be clues left behind.
Please search to your heart's content!
So that's how it is. <cf>As expected of you, Ji. You've done your homework perfectly.
Good!　Let's look for the "proof of courage!
Why ...... can't I find it? <cf>What do you mean, Grandpa?
I thought that if something had fallen, I would have found ....... <cf>So it seems I wasn't so naive.
Let's go to the next place. <cf>Don't worry. This experience will make you stronger, little boy.
......Mmm, you're right. <cf>Haste makes waste.
Don't be in a hurry. <cf>It takes courage to be found so easily.
Good! <cf>Next stop, an oasis in the Evergreen Desert.
<cf>Grandfather, go ahead of me. <cf>I'll go with the adventurers.
<cf>Yes, sir. <cf>So, Mr. Adventurer. Boy. I'll see you later.
Next time we're going to <cf>the oasis in the "Plain of Orbid"!
Next time we'll find the clue to the "Proof of Courage"!
We have been waiting for you, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for escorting the little monk!
Boy. <cf>The oasis is also a place where many travelers stop by!
I've heard that there is a culture of people writing down stories of their journeys and <cf>advice to those who come back later.
<cf>There may be a note about the "proof of courage" as well.
I see, that might be promising. <cf>Okay, I'll check it out!
I'll find it this time, the "proof of courage"! <cf>Wait and see!
Adventurer!　Look at this! <cf>A note left by a traveler.
<cf>They say they found the ruins of Buffalia nearby. <cf>It also says that it was a while ago.
There you'll find the 'proof of courage'. <cf>I'm going to the Buffarian ruins!
Wait a minute, little boy. <cf>The ruins are a dangerous place!
<cf>I can't protect you in my old age!
No, I have made up my mind.
<cf>I can't become a respectable merchant like my father if I back down like this!
In other words, I can't even take over the family! <cf>No, old man!
Ummm...... you seem to be firm in your decision. <cf>Of course, sir.
Adventurer. I have a request. <cf>Please take us to the ruins.
We are requesting you as our official escort. <cf>Of course, we will not overreach.
For the sake of your little boy's great growth. <cf>Please help us, sir.
<cf>Please take us to the ruins on the "Old Rainfall Road".
Oh, ...... you have arrived safely!
You are indeed a first-rate adventurer. <cf>The demons were no more than a few.
No, you really are amazing. <cf>Adventurers are like ......
<cf>They don't get lost, and they beat monsters with ease.
I can't do anything yet. <cf>I honestly think it's awesome.
Come on, kid. <cf>It's now or never, sir.
Mm, yeah. <cf>Let's hurry up and look for the "proof of courage"!
Hmm ......?　Oh, hey! <cf> Look at this!
I found it. It's a piece of heritage! <cf> It's a "Testament of Courage"!
Oh, wow, it's still awesome! <cf>It's glistening in your hand!
Brilliant! <cf>That's my boy!
...... No. <cf>This is not something I found alone.
<cf>This is the proof that adventurers like you fought <cf>hard to get it.
Come to think of it, that guy's dad is an adventurer too. <cf>I'm sure he overcame difficulties.
I think I understand a little<cf> why they call this a "proof of courage".
Thanks for all your help. Thank you for all you've done for me. <cf>Please accept my reward.
I will pay you well for your work. <cf>That's the rule in my house.
<cf>I'm sorry for being so cocky. <cf>I'm still a novice, half a man.
If you ever need my help again, I'd love to help you. <cf>Let me learn a lot of things!
Well, I'm sorry for asking you to do me such a pathetic favor.
I got a <cf> strange lamp the other day as a reward for a job I did.
According to legend, it contains a white spear that pierces the darkness.
Sounds interesting, right? <cf> But I don't know how to light it.
We mercenaries specialize in fighting, and <cf>we're not very good at research.
I thought maybe an adventurer could help me with that.
Do you want me to go to ...... and ask someone who seems to know a lot? <cf>I know, right?　That's what I thought too.
So I asked a friend of mine who is a scholar, but <cf>every single thing he said was too complicated.
When I told him that, he bent over backwards.
I'm sorry, but can you go ask him again? <cf>You can understand what he's saying.
<cf> This is a woman named Ferena from Salamzato. <cf>She's smart, but she's not very flexible.
I'm going to ask the merchant who gave me the lamp to tell me <cf>where he got it.
So, let's split up! <cf>Good to meet you!
There's a scholar in Salamzat named Ferena.
<cf>Would you ask her about the unusual way of lighting lamps?
I'm sure you'll understand what he's talking about.
I'll ask the merchant who gave me the lamp to tell me <cf>where it came from. Nice to meet you!
Oh, I'm busy. Busy. <cf>I've got to get my books together.
Huh?　Yes, I have. <cf> I'm the scholar, Ferena, and I'm...
Schuette's messenger? <cf> Mwah. I already told you about the lamp.
<cf>I went to the trouble of looking it up for you, but she just dozed off and didn't listen!
Do you want me to teach him again? <cf>...... Well, I don't mind if you do.
But in return, you have to help me with my work.
Research doesn't come for free, <cf>I'd like to get a little something in return.
Actually, some of the books in my collection were damaged by sand, so I decided to move them to <cf>Asterlys</cf>.
It's quite a lot, so I was going to use <cf>a horse-drawn carriage:</cf> ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/> has made so many holes in the road that <cf>I can't drive the wagon through it!
We were waiting for the Pioneer Bureau to respond, <cf>just in time!
Adventurers can beat <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>, right? <cf>Please drive them away from near the street.
Then I will tell you about the lamps. <cf>I'll ask you to do that as a condition of the exchange.
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>Please drive off the horde of <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/> in
Ah, adventurers! You have defeated <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Thank you very much. <cf>And I'm sorry for being rude!
It was Suzette who was at fault, wasn't it? <cf>You had nothing to do with it.
I regret that I asked you to do something unreasonable. <cf>I'm really sorry for being so arrogant and ...... in my manner of speaking!
Um, I'm sorry to say that I apologize, but <cf>I've been rifling through as much literature as I can find!
It seems that <cf>"multiple crystals of engrams" are required to turn on the lamp that Suzette has.
Around here, it looks like ....... <cf>It should be found near the "Whispering Cliffs".
However, I'm a little concerned about the fact that it says "for festivals".
A "white spear that pierces the darkness"<cf>that's a bit exaggerated for a festival, don't you think?
I don't think anything bad will happen, but<cf> just in case, be careful!
Well then, I'll be off. <cf>Please give my regards to Suzette.
[The next time something troublesome happens, <cf>I'll definitely have you take care of it.
Around here, you should be able to find it near <cf>"The Whispering Cliffs".
Please give my best wishes to Suzette. <cf>["]I'll have you take care of the next nuisance."]]
Hey, good work! <cf>Did you hear from Ferrena?
Did you get rid of ......<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>Haha!　That's a bummer.
I'll be sure to thank Ferrena for that. <cf> That guy's got a lot to say, doesn't he?
What, he's still pretty mad at me ......? <cf> Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
So you've heard about the new literature. <cf>...... "Multiple Crystals of Engram" and for the festival.
I asked the merchant about it, and he said, <cf>The lamps came from Asterlys.
He said it was a legacy from <cf>Bafaria</cf>, prepared for a diva.
Songs and festivals or ....... <cf> Sounds like a fun tool!
Hahaha, I'm starting to look forward to it! <cf>Since we're here. Let's light the lamp together!
<cf>The multiple crystals are at the "Whispering Cliffs", right? <cf> Okay!　Let's go look for it!
<cf>The multiple crystals of Engram are located at the Cliff of Whispers in the Plain of Orbid, right?
Let's gather them up quickly and light the lamp together!
Oh, there it is. <cf>This is the "Multiple Crystals of Engram.
Let's put it in the lamp right away!
Come on, "The White Spear that Pierces the Darkness"! <cf> Show us what it is!
Wow!　It's dazzling!
Wow! ....... <cf>That was amazing. My eyes still flicker.
Not exactly blinding ......, is it? <cf>It wasn't just the brightness of the lamps, man.
Oh ...... I see. <cf>I should just light up the sky.
Look. <cf>The light goes straight up to the sky.
You can see it clearly at night when it's this bright. <cf>I see. So, "The White Spear that Pierces the Darkness."
I've seen something like it before at the Star Festival. <cf>There was a light like this shining on the Diva of Buffalia.
There were many more lights then, though. <cf>It was sparkly and beautiful. ......
Hehe. I've been given a good legacy. <cf>I'll brag about it to Ferrena.
It was fun!　Thanks for hanging out with me, man. <cf>I'll see you again when we have a chance!
Odd that we meet up in Salamzat as well. <cf>No, you don't have to tell everyone.
We are both seekers of the secrets of [raija]. <cf>It is only natural that our feet should lead us to the same place.
<cf>You also <cf>had a hunch that there was a clue here, didn't you?　Good instincts!
<cf>The ancient coin you requested this time, <cf>in fact, the same one is kept in the Order.
<cf>They used to be visible at all times. <cf>However, this was not the case for a priest of the third rank.
Indeed,...... stone-headed priests. <cf>Trying to cover up the truth won't work!
...... Oops, excuse me. <cf>Anyways, I want the actual coins!
It seems to be in the ruins of Buffalia in the Plain of Orbid. <cf>Other adventurers may be looking for it.
I think it would be a good idea to talk to them. <cf>Thank you in advance!
Ancient coins are said to be found in the ruins of <cf>Bafaria</cf> in the "Plain of Orbid.
If you talk to the adventurers there, <cf>you might find out something.
Huh. <cf>You've come looking for ancient coins too?
Hmph. <cf>I'm Aaron, an adventurer. Nice to meet you.
<cf> I found a coin too. <cf> It's a beautiful coin that glitters in all the colors of the rainbow when it's raised ......
<cf>A shine is a fleeting thing. <cf>Ancient splendor lost and still more fleeting
Huff....... <cf>You're just like me, aren't you?
...... I've got a proposition for you, by the way. <cf>Will you listen?
There's a <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/> going nuts nearby. <cf>If we leave it alone, it will damage the ruins.
So we've been asked by the <cf>Pioneer Bureau to take them down as soon as possible.
Hu....... <cf>I guess it was too much for me.
<cf>So I'm asking you to take them down instead. <cf>Of course, I'll pay you for it.
<cf>Yes, and I'll give you some of the coins I collected. I'll even give you some of the coins I've collected. <cf>You can use it for something.
If you successfully defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>come back here.
I'll stay here a while longer to heal my wounds.
Huff....... <cf>What a fragile adventurer, I am.
Huff....... I'd like you to go take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> for me.
Come back here when you have finished successfully. <cf>I will give you my collection of ancient coins.
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_00_01001"/>, I see you have finished defeating it. <cf>Thank you. Nice work.
Hmph. <cf>Your success is etched in my mind's heroic tale.
The ancient coin you promised. <cf> Try it out.
See, it glows in all the colors of the rainbow. <cf> Even in the dark, it glows by itself when you hold it up.
I don't know how it works. <cf> But that's a minor detail.
<cf>The beauty of the coin remains the same. <cf>And the ephemeral nature of the ancient splendor that quietly remains.
Hu....... <cf>That's the romantic side of it all.
Well, I'm well rested. <cf>I'm going back to the city.
<cf> Have a safe trip back home. <cf>Fu, I'll see you soon.
Hoo ....... <cf> You can do what you want with the coins I gave you.
Oh, you're going back to Salamzat too. <cf>You're going to deliver the coins to a priest named Wahlkin.
Oh, indeed, it is the coin you asked for! <cf>Thank you!
No, I missed it. <cf>I can feel my heart being stirred!
When I was a kid, my parents <cf>showed me this coin.
That was the beginning of my <cf>interest in various histories!
My starting point, so to speak. <cf>I wanted to keep it with me if I could!
This coin appears to be a relic from a <cf>different civilization than the Buffalian civilization.
It has nothing in common with the Luno coins either. <cf>Hmmm, it is strange to see it again!
The rainbow-colored glow may be to prevent fakes from being made. <cf>With today's technology, it is impossible to make one identical to this one.
Have you noticed ......? <cf>Yes. Why would such a coin be found in an archaeological site?
The key is [raija]! <cf>No doubt!
A different world, or a different time! <cf>If it belongs to a visitor from there: ......
<cf>It makes sense that coins from different civilizations would be found <cf>at the site of Buffalia!
Ancient coins were brought by the visitors! <cf>Maybe it is something that leads to the god of Buffalia!
A single coin can lead us <cf>into the mysteries of a magnificent world yet to be seen!
What do you think? Don't you feel <cf>rom the romance!
...... style. No, I'm sorry. <cf>I'm getting hot again!
The coin has renewed my feelings. <cf>I will surely get to the truth of history!
You and I have a connection. <cf>So, let's discuss again somewhere else!
Welcome, adventurer! <cf>My vegetables are very tasty!
No, no, no! <cf>We don't want you to buy our vegetables!
I want to get my hands on <cf>Bafaria's heritage</cf> so I can sell more vegetables!
Mr. <cf>Rueben, the dairy farmer from Minsterhorn, has it.
I don't know how it works, but <cf>he can make things cold!
Tomatoes taste good when they're cold, don't they? <cf> Especially since it's so hot in Salamzat.
<cf>I think if you put cold vegetables on the table, people will jump at it!
I wonder if you could give them away somehow. <cf> Or even just lend them to us for a bit!
Adventurer, could you ask them once? <cf>Thank you!
I need some of that Buffalian heritage that makes things cool.
<cf>Mr. Rueben, a dairy farmer in Minsterhorn, has it.
Could you ask him if he could give it to me? <cf>Thank you!
Kurt, you're the one who ran the errand for the little guy, right?
That's a Buffalian heritage that makes things cold. <cf>Yes, I do have it.
<cf>Here, this is it. <cf>I guess you could call it a canteen made of iron.
<cf>Whatever you put in it gets cold as ice in no time.
It's a way to <cf>carry fresh milk from the farm.
But they are smaller than I thought they would be, and <cf>only hold a cup or two</cf>.
It's not good for our business. <cf>It's fine for my own use.
<cf>Kurt boy wants one? <cf>Yes, he does. And I've been good to your parents.
It would be better for them to use it well<cf>than to keep it in our house.
If you want to give them away, that's fine. <cf>But before you do, would you do me a favor?
This morning, <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> was after my cattle. <cf>I managed to chase them off.
Apparently there's a <cf> herd that has this area as their territory.
I'd hate to see it happen again. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Would you please drive them away?
I'll give you that reward and a set of inheritance. <cf>Thank you in advance.
I need you to <cf>kill the <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>that are after the cows and get rid of them.
You <cf>did</cf> get rid of the <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/> herd. That's quite a feat.
Thank you. <cf>There you have it, the promised legacy of Buffalia.
I hope it's useful to you, Kurt-boy. <cf> Now, deliver it to him.
I hope it's useful to you, Kurt boy. <cf>Come on, deliver him that legacy.
Kurt-boy's in Salamzaat.
Wow!　That's a Buffalian legacy! <cf> They really gave it away!
What did you say to him and ask him? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Defeat?　Amazing!
Thanks to the adventurers. <cf>Ah, so this is the legacy that makes things cold.
You're right, it's smaller than I thought. <cf>I guess we can't put vegetables in it as it is.
...... No, but cut up fruit would work! <cf>Yeah, that's a good idea.
<cf>Cold, sweet fruit for merchants and travelers who have traveled through the desert!　Great, great idea!
Thank you! <cf>This will bring us some new customers!
I'll sell cold, <cf>sweet fruit to adventurers, too, anytime!
You'll be looking for Ellie, won't you? <cf>Thank you. I couldn't find her anywhere.
I was showing the kids a puppet show, and <cf>before I knew it, she disappeared.
Ellie has the appearance of a graceful cat. <cf>My dear friend.
It's not just that she's a doll of my own making. <cf>I was worried that she might have been in a scary situation. ......
ring a bell?　...... Yes, I do. <cf>Maybe the kids know something.
Ellie disappeared during the puppet show, so <cf>there must be at least one witness.
Let's split up and talk to them. <cf>When you find out something, let me know.
Ellie has the appearance of a graceful cat.
She was showing a puppet show to the children, <cf> and before I knew it, she disappeared.
Let's split up and talk to the villagers. <cf>When you find out something, let me know.
Oh, what shall we do? The cat is at ....... <cf>What should we do? ......
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
I'm looking for a white cat doll. ......
Wow, I know!　I saw it!
It was when Mr. Paolo was doing his puppet show. <cf>I found a cat doll at the entrance of the village.
I had to pick it up and deliver it, but <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>came running.
I took the cat in my mouth and <cf>just like that, he ran away. ......
I can't chase it out of the village because it's too dangerous. ......<cf>Mr. Paolo's play is still going on. ......
I don't know what to do. <cf>I'm sorry!
Please tell <cf>Paolo about the cat!
Mr. Cat also said ["]help me ["]! <cf>I heard you so clearly.
...... What? <cf>Are you asking me if the cat can talk even though it's a doll?
That's true. ...... Huh? <cf>Then what the heck is that voice ......?
The cat's doll, <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>went running with it in its mouth......
Please tell Paolo about this.
Did any of the kids see Ellie? <cf>Good!　I found a clue.
So what's the girl's name?
......<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> took <cf>Ellie!
Oh my god!　Ellie is a doll. <cf>It's not made that sturdy.
If she gets bitten by a monster or something<cf>she'll break easily!
Please. <cf>Will you hurry and get Ellie back?
<cf>I'll thank the girl who taught me.
<cf>I'd feel sorry for you if you let it bother you too much. <cf>There's nothing wrong with the girl.
You're all she's got. <cf>Please help Ellie.
Make me and the girl feel safe. <cf>Please, please, please!
Please defeat the <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> around here and <cf>help Ellie who has been kidnapped!
Please, please, please!
This cat doll is ...... Ellie! <cf>You rescued her!
Thank you so much! <cf>I can't thank you enough!
But I'm covered in scratches all over ....... <cf>Ellie, I'm so sorry. Poor thing.
I'll fix it right up for you. <cf>Sorry. I just need a little more help.
Ellie's body is made of a special material. <cf>I'll have it fixed in no time.
I need you to find <cf>the central circuit of <value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>.
The <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/> you encounter in <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/> should drop it.
I promised that girl that I would <cf>show her a healthy Ellie.
As a puppeteer, I can't let my children <cf>sadden</cf>.
I'll be ready to fix Ellie. <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>'s central circuit'," I asked.
I need to repair Ellie right now, <cf>I'm using a special material on her body.
I need you to go to <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/> and look for <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>'s central circuit.
You should be able to get it <cf>by defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E009_01_01_02001"/>.
I'll be ready to fix up Ellie, <cf>I just need a little more help.
I'll be ready to fix Ellie, <cf>I just need a little more help. <cf>Thanks!
Now I can get Ellie fixed up.
Oh, and if I do this ......<cf> and embed this here ......
......Okay! <cf>Here you go, Ellie?
<cf>Here you go, Ellie.
Oh, thank goodness! <cf>Sounds like you're feeling better.
Hmm?　What's the matter? <cf> You look so surprised.
Oh, I didn't tell you. <cf> Ellie is an autonomous doll.
<cf>She can move and talk on her own, thanks to technology from her Buffalian heritage.
I've been working on autonomous dolls for a while now. <cf>Ellie is the first prototype.
She must have walked around during the puppet show. <cf>That's a real pain in the ass.
'Sorry, meow.
You're asking if she can talk freely? <cf> That's a secret. I'll leave that to your imagination.
Now, let's resume the puppet show. <cf> We need to get the kids smiling.
Thanks for everything. <cf> You've been a great help to us. You've been a real help.
<cf> Oh, ....... <cf>I wonder where he is now. ......
...... Oh, sorry, sorry. <cf>I was working on a role for my next play.
This upcoming production is a love romance. <cf>Now that was a line.
<cf>I've been working on the role on my own, but it hasn't been going so well.
I was looking for someone to play the role, and <cf>I found someone who fits the role perfectly!
I was just passing by the road there, and <cf>she's an adventurous woman!
She was walking so dashingly, with her chest out proudly<cf>I couldn't help but admire her!
I bet she has confidence in herself. <cf>She's the perfect heroine for this time.
But while I was admiring her, she was gone, and I didn't even know where she was.
I'd love to have that person as my partner! <cf>Would you please go find her?
<cf>I've been walking towards the pioneer station, so if you see anyone who looks like her, please give her a call.
In order to complete my role, <cf>I'd like to ask that adventurer to be my partner!
He walked toward the pioneer station, so <cf>would you please look for her?
Hmm?　What do you want from me?
...... Hmmm. You're looking for a <cf>young female adventurer</cf> who was walking around town?
Yes, I am. As you can see, I'm an adventurer. <cf>I was just out for a walk earlier.
I wonder if I might be of any use to you.
...... What?　I'm the actor's partner? <cf>Wait, wait, wait. That's a mistake!
<cf>That sounds like a bad joke to me!
<cf>I'm confident in my skills, but...<cf>I'm a woman, so I can't play the heroine. <cf>I don't want to be taken advantage of just because I'm a woman.
But being an actor? <cf>And a love romance?　More and more unlikely!
Einar, right? <cf>Will you let me meet the actor who asked you to do that?
I think you're looking at it wrong. <cf>But, well, you seem to be in trouble.
<cf>If I've mistaken you for someone else, you've mistaken me for someone else, <cf>I might remember something else.
I don't think you <cf>might</cf> be mistaken in thinking that someone as rough as me is playing the heroine.
I'm glad you brought me along!　Thank you!
You're Einar? <cf> I heard you were looking for a rehearsal partner.
Yes, I am! <cf>But ......?
She looks like a woman I've seen, but there's something ......
Something different, I guess. <cf>It looks like I'm not the one you're looking for.
Oh, good! <cf>I can't be the love romance partner.
Sorry for the fuss! <cf> And that was kind of rude. ......
Oh, that's okay. I don't mind. <cf> More importantly, the person you're looking for, I think I have an idea who it is.
You know, the spiffy, cool female adventurer, right? <cf>I'm probably talking about Tsurka.
<cf>The vibe is totally different, but her physique is similar to mine. <cf>We're the same age.
<cf>She's also very skilled and has a certain elegance about her. <cf>He could be a good actor.
Mr. Tsurka or ....... <cf>Sorry. Could you bring that person in, please?
I think Tsurka would be at the <cf>camp on the "Old Rainfall Road". Look for him.
Sorry. <cf>Maybe that's the Tulka I saw.
He said he's at the camp on the "Old Rainfall Road". <cf>Could you bring him to me?
I am Tulka. <cf> What?　You want me to play a role partner?
That would be an honor. <cf>I'd love to, I'd say. ......
I have another request right now. <cf>Sorry, but I'd like to finish this one first.
It's a request to <cf>deliver a "thirsty rose" that blooms around here.
It's a pretty hardy plant, and <cf>they use it in Salamzat as a net to keep monsters away.
If you don't mind, could you help me? <cf>In return, I'll do your request for you.
Of course, I'm not saying I'll work for free. <cf>I'll pay you part of the reward.
I'm going to make it easy for you. It's only natural. <cf>So, let's get this over with quickly.
Ten bottles of Thirsty Roses. <cf>When you've collected them, we'll meet back here.
I'd like to take on a role, but <cf>I'd like to finish the request I'm taking on now.
Would you be willing to collect <cf>'thirsty roses' that bloom in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>?
We'll meet up here when you're done.
You collected the "thirsty roses" for me. <cf>Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks to you, it went without a hitch. <cf>My request is now finished.
Next comes your request. <cf>As promised, I'll take the other side.
It was Mr. Einar, wasn't it? <cf>Guide me to that actor.
I will accept the role as promised.
The actor, Mr. Einar, is in Salamzaat, right? <cf>Give me the tour as soon as possible.
Are you, by any chance, ...... Mr. Tsurka?
Yes, I am. I've been appointed as your partner for the rehearsal. <cf>Thanks for your help.
Oh, that storytelling ...... standing ......!
You're the one I was looking for! <cf>I knew you'd fit the image perfectly!
Please, would you <cf>be my training partner?
No acting or dialogue required. Just stand there and <cf>stimulate my imagination!
Is that all you want?　Okay, I get it.
Yeah, beautiful posture. <cf>Scenes keep popping into my head!
...... Okay, let's get started.
'--Oh, my beautiful flower! <cf>Even the stars lose their luster before your beauty!
"<cf> Even civilizations that once flourished will perish before you.
<cf>Your form is so dazzling! <cf> so dazzling that you will be beyond the reach of all light!"
...... What can I say? <cf>Yes, it's more embarrassing than I imagined.
<cf>I've never experienced such hot words being hurled at me before!
No, it's just not in your face. ...... <cf>Inwardly, I'd like to run away.
Just standing there, etc., is outrageous. <cf>I'm much more comfortable dealing with monsters.
Actors, in some ways, <cf>may be much braver people than adventurers!
Yeah, it's great! <cf>I feel like I can play a role like never before!
All thanks to you. Thank you. <cf>I think I've come a long way as an actor.
That's the best. <cf>So, I'll now go to ......
No, no!　Mr. Tsurka <cf>still has to keep me company.
I have plenty of lines. <cf>Now, let's keep going!
'Oh!　You are <cf>fresher than a desert oasis,<cf> you ......!'
Gosh, ......! <cf>Will it go on like this from beginning to end? ......
I just got a letter from my uncle Bros. <cf>He's in trouble and wants me to send someone over.
Adventurer. I'm sorry, but <cf>could you go check on Bros?
Eh?　That's not enough for you to know? <cf> No, no, I think I can tell at a glance.
<cf>Bross is the odd man out digging a hole in the desert near our camp in the Valley of the Sunshine.
Why is he digging a hole? <cf> Hmmm......... can you stop laughing and listen to me?
...... treasure hunting
Haha, it's okay. <cf>I think it's a stupid story too.
In fact, I've been laughed at so many times. <cf>My relatives won't even touch the bros story.
But that doesn't stop them from saying that Bross definitely has a treasure. <cf>["]There is a Meldrethite treasure! ["]]"] he said.
You'll have to ask Bross himself about the rest. <cf>He knows a lot more than I do.
Oh, yes. Deliver this to him. <cf>Servings and water. And some medicine for your wounds. I've wrapped the bare minimum.
Bross is stubborn and blunt, but<cf> he's not a bad guy. I'm sorry. Please don't hate me.
I'd like you to go check on Bros. <cf>And I'd also like you to deliver some water, food, and a set of medicines.
<cf>There's a strange man near the camp in the Valley of the Sunflower who goes out of his way to dig a hole in the desert.
That guy is Bros. I don't know what he's doing. <cf> Nice to meet you.
What the hell, you. <cf>You're wasting your time talking to me.
...... adventurer?　Did Terua tell you to come here? <cf> Well, I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry about that. Sorry about that.
You're bothering Teruah, too. <cf>The only one who cares about me is her.
I'm digging a hole here. <cf> because down there is the treasure my ancestors left me.
......Yes. You see. <cf>There is no country, no city, no nothing here. Not now.
But there once was. <cf>A metropolis that was as developed as Khartoum.
The name of that country was Meldreit. <cf>My ancestors were Meldrethite royalty, apparently.
<cf>Well, they sank to the bottom of the sand with Khartoum when the desertification of this area progressed.
That was hundreds of years ago. <cf>Now they are just ordinary citizens.
So you can't deny that it's just a tall tale. <cf> Except to actually dig.
<cf>I know they think I'm an idiot. <cf>I know I'm shunned by my relatives.
But I have to dig a hole here. <cf>even if there is no treasure!
...... my bad. I got a little heated.
Anyway, I never stop digging. <cf>But sometimes I need a hand!
Thanks for coming all the way out here. <cf>I'll get right to it...can you do me a favor?
<cf><cf><cf>I stupidly injured my hand digging. <cf> I'm sure there are some medicinal herbs nearby.
What?　You have the potion that Terua gave you? <cf>...... that guy. Why didn't you just leave it alone?
<cf>I'll be grateful for it. <cf>But I'd better stock up just in case.
<cf>Go find me some "lizardbush grass". <cf>It's a good remedy for bruises and sunburn.
<cf>Thanks for your time. <cf>Thank you.
<cf>Please find me some "Bald Cypress" that grows in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>" for stockpiling wound medicine.
It makes a good remedy for bruises and sunburn.
Oh, thanks for your help. <cf>"Bald Cypress", it looks like you've gathered it.
Thanks for the help. <cf>I have to thank Teruah again.
I hope this ridiculous hole digging is at least a little bit <cf>beneficial</cf> for that girl.
[--]When this land became thin and deserted, <cf>the Meldrethite inhabitants moved to Salamzat.
It's a big move for one country. It would cost a lot of money. <cf>At that time, my ancestors gave up their personal wealth
They were willing to lose their royal status and authority.
I loved this story. My family saved a lot of people, even if they are just citizens now.
But if the treasure my ancestors left behind was buried<cf>that would be a whole different story. You see?
My ancestors pretended to give away their wealth. <cf>I would have continued to deceive people with a beautiful story that never happened.
So there shouldn't be any treasure left. <cf> My ancestors lost everything, but they saved the people of the desert!
That's why I'm digging. <cf>To prove that 'there is no treasure' and to protect the family's honor.
It's a tiny bit of pride, but <cf>I want to make it a real beautiful story that Terua and his descendants can pass down!
I felt better when I told him. <cf>I think I'll take a little break.
<cf>Maybe there is something in you that can open the mind of such an eccentric person. Thank you.
<cf>My house is being remodeled right now. <cf>I'm thinking of taking this opportunity to update the furniture.
Especially the headboard, it's getting old. <cf>I've commissioned a highly respected sculptor from Asterlys.
<cf>I've commissioned one that will bring out the wild side of me!
Mr. Aurélie, <cf>a man known for his skill in the field</cf>, was hired to carve the headboard.
<cf>He is known to be a great sculptor in this field. <cf>I'm looking forward to it.
So, I went to Mr. Aurelie's house. <cf>Would you please go to Mr. Aurelie's house and pick up the headboard?
If it's not finished yet, <cf>you can ask him for the next due date.
<cf>An artist is a man of many things. <cf>Some delays are to be expected.
But you'll be in trouble if you're late getting home. <cf>Make it quick and come back.
Well, good luck. Wahaha!
Go to the home of <cf>Mr. Aurelie, the acclaimed sculptor of Asterlys.
<cf>Austelles' acclaimed sculptor, Mr. Aurelie, to pick up a headboard that will make you feel wild!
Oh, you. You want Mr. Aurelie? <cf> That freak wouldn't be home.
<cf>Well, it saves us from having to listen to his strange noises in the middle of the night.
Every night ["]wild, eend, dynamic! <cf>Hyo-oh-oh-oh! [...] every night.
My mimicry is quite similar to yours.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. <cf>And to top it all off, he came to our house this morning.
[I just don't get it! <cf> What is wild? [I asked him.
I told him to look at an amazing ogre, and he opened his eyes and ran away.
He looked me in the eye and ran away. <cf>And I don't think he's been back since.
Do you have any idea where he went? <cf>Well, maybe <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>.
My husband is an adventurer, and he said there was a great ogre named <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>.
I remembered that and told Aurelie about it. <cf>Did I say something funny?
Was I wrong to tell Aurelie about <cf> <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>?
You know, the last time I went to <cf>Uribo's to ["]find out about cuteness["], I came home in tatters. ......
<cf>I came home in tatters. <cf>I was woken up in the wee hours of the morning that time, too.
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" seems to appear in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>". <cf>If you really went to look, you'd be there.
The "<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" fight is at ......<span size="Big">Wow, that's great! </>
This primal breath of fresh air! <cf>Yes!　This is what I've been looking for, yes [--]!
<span size="Big">Dynamic Inspiration! </>
Thank you so much ma'am! <cf>Now my masterpiece is about to be born!
...... hmm?　What's up, dude? <cf>Don't dawdle, fight me properly!
A battle for the souls of adventurers and "<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01_01001"/>" to shred lives! <cf>Therein lies the true wild I seek!
Don't mind if I do! <cf>If I scream, somehow "<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01_01001"/>" will not approach me!
You must have something to tell me, right?　But I hate to say it! <cf>My heart is now preoccupied with the battle between you and "<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01_01001"/>"!
<cf>My ears won't hear a word of any kind until I get this wild fight burned into my heart!
That's why. <cf>Go ahead. Come on, do it.
My mind is on you and your <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/> fight right now!
Don't just stand there and <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01_01001"/>" and fight me properly!
Well, good for you! <cf>That was so wild!
Even <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01_01001"/>, who lost to you, looked <cf>fresh-faced!
And your fight produced my masterpiece! <cf>Now, let me show you!　I'll carve it!
What, you don't want to see it? <cf>Then what are you doing here?
...... Mr. Manfredo's headboard? <cf>What? That thing is long overdue.
A goblin warlord finishing off a boar! <cf>That's another wild masterpiece!
<cf> But now that I've made it, I'm starting to wonder, <cf>[what is wild? [I'll keep working on it.
Well, I'll keep working on it! <cf>What?　Do I have to go home?
...... need me to give you the headboard? <cf>Oh, well. Well, I guess I'll be going home!
I'd like to keep working on it a little longer, but <cf>Yeah!　Give me the headboard.
I'm going back to Asterlys!
<span size="Big">That was a dynamic trip! </>
Here it is. Here's the headboard you ordered. <cf>Well, I gotta go make the next one!
It's simmering! <cf>Visions of dynamic, wild battles!
You and "<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/>" were awesome! <cf>Thank you!
Come on, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it! <cf>Carve, carve, carve, carve, carve, carve!
<cf>Well, the battle between you and <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_01_01001"/> was really hot!
Take that <cf>headboard</cf> to Mr. Manfredo in Salamzato!
I've got to work on my next one!
Oh, Mr. Aurelie's headboard! <cf>You finished it!
Hoho ....... <cf>Wow, this is wild and wonderful again!
I don't know what it is, but <cf>I can feel the heat and wildness anyway!
Put this under your pillow and go to sleep, <cf>you're sure to wake up wild!
You are a man who understands the value of art. <cf> Carefully carried and not a scratch on it!
Mmmmmm, thank you!　I'm very satisfied. <cf>If you ever need anything else, please let me request it!
Hmmm.......... You seem to have a good nose too. <cf>That's a pretty good call to pick me.
Once again, I am Cattleya. <cf>I'm a trader. Nice to meet you.
This time, I'm looking for "Kartoum's Fangwork". <cf>These crafts are made by decorating the fangs of monsters.
It is said to have once been made in the ancient desert city of Khartoum.
<cf>The method and technique have been lost, but it is still very popular among connoisseurs.
I want to bring this tuskwork back to life in the modern age.
<cf>Because it smells of money! <cf>You will definitely make a lot of money!
<cf>I don't think I can do it alone, though. <cf>I know you want a good business partner.
I've heard good things about you at the pioneer station. <cf>I hear you're quite a skilled adventurer.
<cf>I need you to gather the tusks for me. <cf>I'll handle the negotiations.
<cf>We need someone to carve the tusks, don't we? <cf>I have a good man in Asterlys.
Aurelie the sculptor. Mr. Manfredo, a wealthy man, <cf>ordered it, so I'm sure he's good.
I'm going to go talk to him and see if he'll take this job. <cf>You collect the "<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> true round tusk.
Meet me at Aurelie's house. <cf>Then I'm asking you to do it. Nice to meet you.
We'll go from <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>" to <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02 I want you to collect <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>'s Round Fangs.
I'll go first to <cf>Aurélie in Asterlys to negotiate.
When I'm done, I'll meet you at <cf>Aurelie's house.
I see you got <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>'s Round Fang. <cf>Thanks. I was just talking to Aurelie too.
Oh wow! <cf>I'm always happy to take on interesting assignments!
I'd like to revive <cf>Cartoum's Fangwork</cf> using this <value type="enemyName" id="E002_02_01_01001"/>'s Round Fang.
I'll get you the real thing, and you can use it as a reference for <cf>carving these fangs for me.
O....... <cf>Tension down.
I'm not into this. ...... <cf>I'm sorry, you'll have to find someone else.
That's not how it works. <cf>What's not to like?
I'm up for a reward. <cf>We need your skills!
That's not how it works. <cf>This puny fang can't express my soul!
Ah mei jing!　But no. <cf>Exciting!　But no. Go home.
What's so shabby about fangs ......? <cf>I don't know what an artist thinks.
But I'm not the one to give up here.
<cf>I'm going to make him shake his head, no matter what it takes.
I'm going to go hunt for the fangs of the <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/>fang</value> in the Dust of No Return!
If it's his fangs, <cf>you won't be able to say they're not good enough.
Don't worry. You can do it! <cf> I mean, who else but you could do it?
So, yes. Have a good day! <cf>Wish me luck!
<cf>You'll be hunting the fangs of the <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/> in the Evergreen Desert's "Dust of No Return"!
It's a job only you can do! <cf> I hope you come back safe and sound!
What is it, you guys again? <cf> I'm not interested in your tusk work.
Hmmm. I wonder if it's okay? <cf> I wonder if I can still talk big when I see these fangs.
<cf> You'll see! <cf>The fangs of the legendary <value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/>!
Ooooooh!　<span size="Big">What the hell! </>
Such a big fang exists?　That's awesome! <cf>I'm getting inspired to create just by looking at it!
Ohohoho!　What do you think? <cf> If you work with me, you can do whatever you want with these fangs?
Seriously!　Yes, I'll take care of it! <cf> I'll do it!
So you'll take care of it, then?
Of course! <cf>Who else can do a job this big but me?
I'll get to work right away! <cf>I'll carve, I'll carve, I'll carve!
Well, we have a deal. <cf>That's the fang of the legendary serpent.
Thanks to you for getting them for me. <cf>That's why you're my partner in crime.
Oh, yes. <cf> Speaking of legends, you know what?
<cf> Do you know the legend of the mighty <cf>Kagachi Yama</cf> lurking in the Montenol Canyon?
They call it <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/> and it's just plain bad.
If I see the fangs of such a guy, <cf>my creative juices will explode. ......
Hm...... no need to tell everyone. <cf>It's my job to keep them motivated.
Okay, I'll try to keep it that way! <cf>I'll get the fangs for <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/> ready!
Ma-ji-ka-yo! <cf>Wow!　You were right to take me on!
It burns!　It roars!　It's boiling! <cf>Now nothing can stop my hand!
<cf>[--]Now, you're out. <cf>[--]Well, you're up.
No, because. <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>"? <cf> What else is there to do but you?
We can't afford to discourage Aurelie. <cf>Please!　You're the only one!
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" and get <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>" fangs!
Please!　You're all I have!
Welcome back. Did you really <cf>...... defeat "<value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>"?
Hey, that's great! <cf>That's great news in itself!
Oh, man!　That's amazing!　That's amazing! <cf>The best fangs on the block!
I can see it!　<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_01_01001"/> and <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_02_01001"/>" in mortal combat!
Enemies who should never have collided! <cf>But through you, these men have met!
A true clash of legends and legends!
<span size="Big">Ah mei jing e xitin! </>
Carve, carve, carve, carve, carve, carve<cf>all because of you!
I'm utterly amazed. Your workmanship. <cf>It was nothing more than I expected!
<cf> But, as for the "Cultuom's Fangwork," <cf> it's not going to be easy to bring it back to life.
<cf>It's not like you can just get fangs of legendary monsters, is it?
On the other hand, Aurelie doesn't seem to work <cf>with normal monster fangs</cf>. ......
The sculpture itself would sell for a good price, but <cf>it wouldn't be an ongoing business.
Well, I've gotten to know you <cf>and that alone has been a huge benefit.
I'm glad you found a nice business partner.
If I come up with another new money-making idea, <cf>I'll definitely call you. Best regards!
Sorry about that, Adventurer. <cf>I'm actually involved in a request for someone else: ......
<value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>", and I asked someone named <cf>Aaron</cf> to investigate.
He was very confident that he had experience in searching for ruins.
So, I left it to him with confidence.
However, when he didn't return and I didn't hear from him,......<cf>I began to feel uneasy.
I thought it would be rude to ask other adventurers to do something like this.
<cf>I'd like to ask for your help. <cf>Please go check on Mr. Aaron.
If I'm overreacting, that's fine. <cf>My apologies to Mr. Aaron.
But if Mr. Aaron is such a <cf>monster</cf> that he is struggling, then you are in big trouble!
Please help him then. <cf>I will also offer you a reward for defeating it.
Mr. Aaron should be somewhere <cf>in the Valley of the Sunflame</cf>.
<cf>God of Buffalia. <cf> Please grant your blessings to those who are faithful.
I hope I'm not being too hard on you, but since I haven't <cf>heard from you, I'm worried. ......
Please make sure you are all right.
Hey there, fellow competitor. I'm Aaron. <cf>Huh. I'm a self-proclaimed professional archaeologist.
Oh?　You and I have met before somewhere ....... <cf> Huh. I feel like we're destined to be together.
Ah, Laure, you asked me to come here. <cf> Huh. I'm sorry. I've made a terrible mistake.
As you can see, the situation is not good. <cf>Huff....... I may have misjudged their capabilities a bit.
The guy behind the <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/> got me.
I managed to escape, but <cf>that's all I could do.
Thank God you're here. <cf>I thank you. <cf>But I can't just leave.
<cf>It would be a shame for an adventurer to leave dangerous monsters on the loose.
Hmph......... <cf>You mean to say, "Don't tell me what to do? <cf>Yes. We have to take him down.
<value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/> There is an <value type="enemyName" id="E500_02_00_00000"/> behind the <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/>. <cf>I want you to take that guy down.
Are you confident?
......Fu. The fighting spirit in your eyes. <cf>There seems to be no room for doubt.
My fate is in your hands. <cf> Huh. Don't worry. I know you can do it.
<cf> Huff....... The fighting spirit in your eyes is beautiful.
I leave my fate in your hands. <cf> Huff. Don't worry. I know you can do it.
Huh. You're good. <cf>You're good.
Huh. A truly elegant and wonderful accomplishment. <cf>Jealous to the point of jealousy.
The monster that appeared in <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/> was <cf> killed by you!
Now, ....... One more thing, do this poor man a <cf> favor</cf>.
My body still hurts. I don't think I'll be able to move for a while. <cf>Can you take me to Mr. Rolle?
Hmph. <cf>I'll ruin my reputation as an adventurer if I leave a woman to worry about me. Come on, we'll be back soon.
Hmph. I'll prove to you that you <cf>defeated</cf> the <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/> monster.
But my body still hurts. <cf>I'm not going to be able to move for a while.
I'm sorry, but I need you to take me to <cf>Mr. Rolle</cf> in Salamzert.
Mr. Aaron!　Thank goodness. <cf>I'm so glad you two are okay.
Hmph. We would have been in danger without your help. <cf>In that sense, I owe it all to you. Mr. Rolle.
Huh. How's that? <cf>We'd like to thank you, and to celebrate our reunion, we're going to have a meal now.
I'm sorry. I have to report <cf> this to the temple.
Hmph. That's not cool. <cf>But that's part of your charm, Laure.
I'll be sure to let the adventurers know what you've accomplished.
Thank you so much. <cf>I, I can't thank you enough.
The heritage of Buffalia is important to people's lives. <cf>But there are still dangers involved in its excavation, aren't there?
In order to improve people's lives, <cf>research of archaeological sites is inevitable. ......
Hmph. <cf>There is no need to be so anxious. <cf>That's why we adventurers are here.
Ruins or monsters, <cf>any danger is yours.
<cf>It is the mission of adventurers to pave the way to the future!
Hu......!　Done.
Yes, it is. And this time, too, I asked the adventurers to <cf>solve the problem.
We shouldn't <cf>stop our steps because we are driven only by anxiety!
Adventurer. Thank you very much. <cf>Please let me know if there is anything I can do in the future.
Hello, adventurer. <cf>I'd like you to pick up a few things for me.
What I'd like to ask for is "The Muddy Eggs of Meen". <cf>You can get it from <value type="enemyName" id="E014_00_00_02001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>.
[What is the use of such a thing?
In the old days, hunters used to use it a lot. <cf>They were the best tools for hunting.
We forget what we know these days so easily,<cf>but we remember the old days so well.
I'll have to do some work on it once I find it, so <cf>when you find it, will you bring it to my house?
I'm sure you'll pick a lot of them. <cf>Thank you.
You can get "muddy eggs of mien" from <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/> in <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E014_00_00_00_02001"/>.
They need to be modified <cf>once</cf> before they can be used as hunting tools.
If you find one, could you bring it to my house?
Good work, adventurer. <cf>You've collected "Meen's Muddy Eggs".
I'm glad you picked so many. <cf>Well then, would you mind waiting a bit?
I've boiled some water. <cf>Will you put the eggs in the water and put this like this: ......
......Yes, it's ready. <cf>I've got a lot of prep work to do here.
Now then, would you please deliver these eggs to a <cf>hunter</cf> named Jimbo?
Jinbo originally asked me for advice. <cf>I hope I can help him.
Oh, yes, yes. <cf>After you deliver it, please come back here.
I have to thank you for your help. <cf>I might be in a bit of trouble.
<cf>Would you please deliver this egg to a hunter named Jinbo in Salamzert?
After you deliver them, please come back here.
Hmm?　<cf> I'm the hunter, Jin. ......
What?　Old Maaya called me <cf>"Jinbo"?
Oh, man. I'm not old enough or skilled enough to be called "boy.
Well, from Grandma Maja's point of view, <cf>most of the people living in this town must be children.
So, if you came on Old Ma-Ya's errand, did you bring <cf>"Meen's Muddy Eggs"?
Actually, I've been on a non-hunting spree lately. <cf> I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was in a bit of a bind.
So I talked to Old Maaya and she told me about <cf>Salamzat's traditional hunting methods.
<cf>They use "meen muddy eggs" to lure the prey.
Oh, so these are the eggs that have been pre-cooked. <cf>I heard they crush them and use them. ......
Ugh, this is  intense!　This is ...... a very strong odor!
I see. <cf>This smell attracts the animal's attention?
No, but it's an amazing smell. <cf>That's a big problem if it gets on your clothes!
Are you all right? <cf>Maybe you should step away from it for a bit.
At least I know how to use it. <cf>I'm going hunting right now.
Are you going back to Grandma Maja's? <cf>Tell her to look forward to the results.
But that smells amazing.
Welcome back. <cf>Wow, what a smell!
Jin-bo, you crushed an egg right away. <cf>You really are a very fussy little boy.
I thought you might smell it too. <cf>Yes. I've prepared some deodorizing herbs for you.
Just keep it on you and the smell will go away in no time. <cf>I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Deserts, you know. It's a land where fragrance is scarce. <cf>That's why strong odors spread so easily.
That's why the smell of "Meen's Muddy Eggs" attracts animals <cf>from afar.
It used to be a <cf>common hunting method in Salamzat and nearby.
The smell was too strong and the eggs were difficult to handle. <cf>It fell into disuse before I knew it.
But I think Jimbo would make good use of it. <cf> That boy is a fine hunter.
I'm glad I was able to leave a desert tradition behind. <cf>Thanks for everything. Kind adventurer.
You've come a long way. <cf>You are going to face more challenges in "Claws of the Giant Dragon".
This time, it is not the usual path you must conquer. <cf>It is an advanced challenge called "The Path to the Dragon.
In the past, the Clawtooths of the Giant Dragon was first conquered by a team of adventurers called <cf>Dragon Crow</cf>.
Of course, this was a time when no research had been done. <cf>There were countless monsters standing in their way.
<cf>After overcoming many such difficulties, <cf>"Dragon Crow" became a legendary team!
This time, we will relive the trials and tribulations of the team's journey.
We will recreate the legend of "Dragon Crow" and reach the same heights. <cf>It is called "The Road to the Dragon" with that meaning in mind.
A novice adventurer can't stand very much against it. <cf>However, if one were to break through, it would be proof of one's ability.
<cf>All top adventurers have taken this path. <cf>You are well qualified to take on the challenge.
Of course, I'm not saying you have to, but how about ......?
<value type="locationName" id="dng009_Hard"/>" <cf>This is the ordeal known as the "Road to the Dragon".
Accomplish it with flying colors and come back here.
<value type="locationName" id="dng009_Hard"/><cf>This is the test known as the Path to the Dragon.
It's not much for a novice adventurer, but <cf>you're more than qualified</cf> to take on the challenge.
<value type="locationName" id="dng009_Hard"/>". <cf>Achieve it with flying colors and come back here.
Well done and come back here. <cf>You have broken through the "Road to the Dragon".
I can see it in your face. <cf>The face of a powerful warrior who has overcome hardship.
It must have been a hard and painful road. <cf>But you are now a first-rate adventurer!
<cf>Congratulations!　You should be very proud. <cf>You have indeed proven your ability.
<cf>As for the road ahead, there will be many more difficult paths before you.
<cf>I hope that when the time comes, you will remember what you have experienced today. <cf>No matter what hardship you face, I am sure you will be able to overcome it.
<cf>We at the Pioneering Bureau welcome you once again! <cf>We are glad to have you with us!
<cf>We are glad to have you with us! <cf>Report back to the Pioneering Bureau on your accomplishments!
Adventurer!　Help!
I'm looking for my sister Nora. <cf>But I haven't found her yet. ......
Nora is blind. <cf>That's why I've been trying to be there for her.
<cf>I tried to be there for her, but when I took my eyes off her for a second, she was gone. <cf>Oh, where did she go?
She must be somewhere in Salamzat. <cf>I don't think he's going to the desert, no matter how much he wants to.
If he tried to leave town, <cf>as expected, someone would have stopped him.
Ah!　But if someone kidnapped me or <cf> attacked me by a monster,<cf> I'd have to go to ......
Anyway, we have to find them fast! <cf>Together we can find Nora!　Please!
Nora is blind. <cf>Anyway, we have to find her fast!
She must be somewhere in Salamzat! <cf>Please!　We have to find Nora together!
Nora!　I found it!
Is that your voice, ...... brother?
You shouldn't have left the house by yourself! <cf> We were worried about you.
I'm sorry ....... <cf>I really needed to go somewhere.
A customer at the store told me about it.
'A glowing flower blooms in the desert at night. <cf> The flower of light cures any eye disease.'
I really wanted that flower. <cf> I'm being inconvenienced because I'm blind. ......
It's not annoying. <cf>You don't have to worry about that.
Besides, the story Nora told me <cf>is a fairy tale called "The Moon Flower."
It would certainly be amazing if it were real, but ....... <cf>There are no such flowers in the desert.
That's not true! <cf>Because I've seen them!
No way. <cf> Look, we're going home.
It's true! <cf>A flower glowing in the desert at night. I remember!
<cf>Calm down, Nora. <cf>I told you it was a fairy tale.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I'll take Nora home first.
<cf>Can you come by the house later so I can thank you properly?
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for finding Nora.
So, I was wondering if you could <cf>help me with one more favor</cf>.
Remember what Nora said earlier? <cf>She said she'd seen "Moonflower" before.
That can't be true. <cf>He keeps insisting that he saw it.
<cf>He's so serious about it, it's starting to bother me.
<cf>I was wondering if there really are "moon flowers" in the desert.
<cf>Once, my family and I walked through the desert at night. <cf>We didn't make it to camp in the light.
<cf>If Nora really saw the moonflower, that's when she saw it.
So I want you to go look for the 'moon flower'. <cf>If you can find it, that would be great.
If even the adventurers can't find it,<cf>I'm sure Nora will agree.
<cf>I want to do what I can for Nora. <cf>I'm sorry to ask you to do something so difficult.
The location is "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>". <cf>Please manage to find the "Moonflower". Please!
If Nora really saw the "Moonflower", I think it was when she walked <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>".
I'm sure <cf>Nora would agree with me if I looked in that area and couldn't find it. ......
Go find "Moonflower" somehow. Please!
Something is reflecting light. <cf>Is this the 'moon flower' that Kurt was talking about?
I picked up the "transparent scales". <cf>Let's show it to Kurt.
Adventurer. Welcome back. <cf>Did you find anything in the desert?
What are these ......? Scales? <cf>But I've never seen transparent scales before!
What do you have in your hand, big brother? <cf>It's sparkling and beautiful!
What, ......?　Nora! <cf>You can see this!
Yes, I can see it. <cf>It's so strange, but I can see it too!
That's amazing! <cf>Nora saw this thing!
But why? <cf>It's invisible, but Nora can see it too!
Yes, I wonder if the doctor can figure it out. <cf>There's a doctor who is taking a look at Nora's eyes.
Can I have it delivered to him? <cf>He knows things, he might know something.
The 'moon flower' that Nora saw was about this! <cf>But I can't believe that Nora can see it, even though it's transparent.
<cf>The doctor who checks Nora's eyes knows <cf>something</cf>, so he might be able to tell us what it is.
The doctor is in town, so can I ask him to deliver it to ......<cf>that person?
I'm the doctor who is examining Nora, ....... <cf>How, Kurt wants me to check this out?
The "transparent scales" that Nora could see: ....... <cf>I see. Very interesting indeed.
<cf>In addition to my medical practice, I am also researching my Buffalian heritage and <cf>technology.
I was wondering if there were any <cf> clues in the Buffalian heritage regarding the treatment of Nora's eye.
But I didn't notice any desert material. <cf>And the fairy tale "Moon Flower"?
The shape seems to resemble the scales of a shadow viper. <cf>But if you call it a petal, it looks like one.
Perhaps the term "moon flower" is <cf> referring to these "transparent scales.
Anyway, let's examine it in detail. <cf>Could you go and collect the 'moon flowers'?
If the lore is correct, the "Moonflower" blooms at night. <cf>Searching the desert at night would be a good idea.
I need more "moon flowers" to find out more. <cf>Sorry, can you gather some for me?
If the lore is correct, the "moon flowers" bloom at night. <cf>It would be better to look for "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" at night.
You've collected the "Moonflower". <cf>Thank you.
I also unraveled the literature of the Buffalian civilization. <cf>I found some interesting descriptions.
I'll check it out right away.
...... Thanks for your patience. <cf>Thanks to you, I've learned a lot.
<cf>The identity of the "Moon Flower" is the scales of the Shadow Viper. <cf>However, it has been altered by the accumulation of large amounts of engrams.
It is apparently due to the action of desert plants. <cf>The "Moonflower" was found near the plant, right?
Apparently, the plant's engrams are poured onto the scales, causing them to <cf>transform into a transparent color.
And the 'moon flower' has a mysterious power. <cf> Haven't you ever heard of it?
Sand vipers and shadow vipers can <cf>sense the appearance and presence of their prey without relying on their eyes!
According to literature, <cf>the Buffalian civilization used similar tools!
The Buffalian gods used sound and vibration to <cf>precisely grasp their surroundings</cf>.
I can't explain the details very well either, but you can read about it at ....... <cf> Anyway, the "Moonflower" could be used to cure Nora.
If we polish the "moon flower" and make glasses, <cf>that girl might be able to see things.
So I processed them into glasses. <cf>Please deliver these to her.
Can you mass produce them? <cf> That would be difficult.
It takes a long time for the scales to transform. <cf>The "Moon Flower" is a precious thing.
Besides, this is just an imitation of the Buffalian heritage. <cf>It can't have the exact same power.
But it has certainly paved the way for the treatment of the eye. <cf>I bet medical science will develop more in the future.
In that sense, I am grateful to you. <cf>That's a wonderful achievement. <cf>Thank you.
Now, enough talk. <cf>Please make that brother and sister happy as soon as possible.
I polished up the "Moonflower" and fashioned it into a pair of glasses.
Maybe that kid will be able to see things. <cf>Take these to Kurt and Nora.
Mr. Adventurer! <cf>What did you say, doctor?
The "Moonflower" glasses: ....... <cf>Maybe this will help you see Nora's eyes: ......?
Really? ....... I'm kind of nervous. <cf>See, Nora. This is it.
<cf>Here you go, Nora. I'll try it.
...... How you doing, Nora? <cf>Do you see my face?
...... No, I can't see your face. <cf>But I can vaguely see your brother's shape.
I see. ...... <cf>Sorry. I didn't fix your eyes properly.
That's not true, big brother!
<cf>I'm so happy that I can now see that my brother is there!
<cf>I can see that you're there too, adventurer. <cf>Thank you so much for doing this for me!
<cf>I used to be so dark, I couldn't see anything. <cf>But now I know you guys, even if it's just a little.
I know you're here. <cf>That's enough for me.
......Yes, it is. <cf>I'm very happy too!
Adventurer. <cf>Thanks for everything you did for my sister.
<cf>I was surprised to hear that "Moonflower" was a true story!
I will continue to help Nora and <cf>someday, I want to heal her eyes!　I'll do my best!
Oh, I left my groceries at the grocery store? <cf>Hahaha!　That's ridiculous.
...... Yeah, I bought those carrots. I forgot. <cf>Thanks for delivering it: ......
Oops!　That's not the fruit I bought. <cf>Did you bring it all the way here?
Thanks a lot!　Nice store. <cf>I'll be buying a lot more next time!
I'm a survey team sent by the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>We're monitoring the star vein holes that appear here.
Did you deliver the relief supplies? <cf>Thank you, that's very helpful.
<cf>It seems that the star vein holes here have the same characteristics as the ones that lead to <cf>the floating island in the void</cf>.
It leads to some strange place, and <cf>there are some crazy monsters inside!
If you plan on going in, be very careful.
I'll put together some research material for you. <cf>Could you please report what you just heard to the Pioneer Bureau?
You're here at the request of the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>I'm a member of the survey team for the star vein hole here.
It's a badass star vein pit that goes out here, too. <cf>There's a big monster in there.
There seems to be more than one place it can lead to. <cf>It's too dangerous to investigate.
<cf>Maybe there will be a request for adventurers. <cf>When they do, be careful and be prepared!
<cf>Will you also report this to the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>I know it's a lot of work, but thank you!
Hmmm, it's a strange plant. <cf>How does it bloom?
Thank you for taking it on. <cf>Mr. Adventurer.
I was entrusted by a client with a <cf> pot of yarrow!
Such long, hard thorns, <cf>I've never seen them before either.
I think it's probably a plant from a faraway country. <cf>I'm having trouble finding any information at all.
Adventurer. Could you please go to the Asterlys Settlement Bureau and look for <cf>books?
I think I can find a book about Ibarra in the archives there.
I will continue to try different things here, like changing the soil and adding fertilizer.
Well then, I'll leave it to you.
There is a library on the second floor of the Asterleys Pioneer Station. <cf>Please look for a book about the mysterious roses.
I found a book called "Roses of the World."
Suljo asked me to <cf>read about hard thorny roses.
'Fossil rose. Also known as petrified rose. <cf> A type of rose famous for its inability to flower.'
'Legend has it that it angered the gods by injuring them with its long, hard thorns and <cf> was turned to stone before it flowered.'
"Studies have shown that it can <cf> flower in soil with high levels of engrams.
"or other means of <cf> filling the soil with engrams will lead to flowering."
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf> Have you found out what the mysterious rose is?
Heh, is it called a Fossil Rose? <cf> There are so many different kinds of roses in the world.
What is needed for flowering is soil rich in engrams. <cf> Or is it to be filled with engrams?
...... then! <cf>"Goblin Briar" might work!
Goblinbriar is a rose that has the characteristic of accumulating <cf>engrams.
If you graft it onto a Fossil Rose, you <cf>may</cf> be able to get it to bloom well!
But Goblin Briar only grows wild in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>".
It's a dangerous place and I can't get to it myself. <cf>Could you go and collect it instead?
Please <cf>search for goblin braai in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>". Please!
Please <cf>look for a plant called "Goblin Briar" in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>".
If it has it, it may flower. <cf>Please do!
Did you bring the "Goblin Briar"?
Yes, this is the Goblin Briar. <cf>Thank you very much!
Well, then, I'll <cf>graft the Fossil Rose right away!
Goblin Briar produces only modest flowers, and <cf>the amount of engrams it accumulates is not much!
So people say, 'It's a worthless plant. <cf>But look at it!
The newly grafted Fossil Rose is<cf>already changing!
The thorns seem to be swelling up a little....... <cf>Maybe these were not thorns, but buds.
It won't bloom right away, but <cf>this will work!
A plant that accumulates engrams and a flower that needs engrams. <cf>Only when the two are combined can they lead to blooming.
There are<cf>so many more mysterious plants in the world!
<cf>Thank you very much, adventurers, for your cooperation!
Now we may be able to bring <cf>new flowers to people all over the world!
When the Fossil Rose blooms, <cf>please come and see it!
I wonder what kind of flower the Fossil Rose is. <cf>I'm looking forward to seeing it bloom!
Ugh, I'm so curious. ...... <cf>Who is that guy?
What kind of relationship does he have with Mr. Suruho? <cf>Is it too much to ask him to do this?
............. <cf>Oh, no!　I'm still curious!
Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for doing me a favor!
Sulho-kun is my childhood friend, <cf>a boy who works in a rose garden!
This Sulho-kun was giving a bouquet of <cf>roses</cf> to his gay sister!
Roses, a bouquet of roses! <cf>That's what this is all about, right?
I guess boys <cf>like that kind of gay guy after all. ......?
...... Oh, aww! <cf>That was nothing!
Anyway, I want to know what kind of relationship you two <cf>have!
Your sister, she was wearing the uniform of the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>And she dropped her handkerchief.
It had "Cecil" embroidered on it. <cf>I think her name was Cecil.
<cf>Would you please deliver this handkerchief as well? <cf>Then, please do me a favor!
<cf>Please deliver the handkerchief to Mr. Cecil at the Asterlys Settlement Bureau.
So, what is your relationship with Mr. Sulho, ....... <cf>Oh, I'd like to hear it, but I don't seem to want to hear it: ......
Yes, I do. Cecil is me. ...... <cf>You have something for me, sir?
Oh, this handkerchief! <cf>I was looking for it. Thank you.
The one you picked up at Minsterhorn is ....... <cf>I see. You dropped it there.
Actually, I had something important wrapped inside. <cf>There was ......!　Oh, thank goodness~!
These are the seeds of the <cf> roses of the outer continent</cf> that Mr. Suruho from the rose garden had asked for!
Huh?　You're dating Sulho-kun, <cf>......?
Haha!　That can't be true. <cf>Mr. Suruho is still a child.
He delivers fertilizer and helps me study plants. <cf>We do have that kind of business relationship, though.
I'm planning to compile <cf>an observation report on this seed, too, along with Sulho-kun's growing it!
By the way, would you like to return to <cf>Minsterhorn</cf> again, Mr. Adventurer?
If so, please deliver <cf> these seeds to Mr. Suruho.
I would be sorry if you drop them again. <cf>Sorry. <cf>Thank you very much.
<cf> Please deliver these rose seeds to Mr. Suruho in Minsterhorn.
I'm just talking to Mr. Suruho on business. <cf> He's a serious, kind, and nice boy.
Eh?　Delivering a package from Mr. Cecil?
Wow, I'm so happy. <cf>It's the rose seeds from the outer continent you asked for!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>Yes. Here's a bouquet of flowers to thank you.
These are roses I cut off when pruning. <cf> I was just using them as a little thank you.
I gave them to Cecil-san, too. <cf>Please don't hesitate, adventurers.
We have lots of them. <cf>Oh, I'll give some to Monica-chan, too.
Adventurer, you have something for Monica? <cf>Then please give her this bouquet of flowers.
I'm sorry it seems like an afterthought. <cf>I want to make Monika-chan happy, so...
<cf>Please deliver this bouquet of flowers to Monika-chan at the Minsterhorn.
I hope she'll be pleased.
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Cecil, did you find it?
...... I see. <cf>It was just a business associate.
Ho...... good. <cf>But then, why the bouquet of roses......?
Huh? <cf>Sulho gave me a bouquet of roses?
<cf>I'm so happy! <cf>Maybe, Mr. Suruho, you're talking about me ......!
...... pruned roses as a thank you ......? <cf> So you don't mean anything deep ......
Well, I guess I was wrong about everything then. <cf>Ugh~ I'm so embarrassed ......
<cf>I think it's very nice, but it's very Sulho-like. <cf>He takes very good care of flowers.
That's the thing about him, I ....... <cf> Uh, uh, it's nothing. Heh heh heh.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I'm really glad I got to know Sulho.
Sulho's roses: ....... <cf> They smell so good!
Oh, no, no, no! <cf>I'm too scared of my master to take a step forward......
I have no guts. ...... <cf>But I can't just leave it like that......
<cf>I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Adventurer.
I'm embarrassed to say this. <cf>I've lost something terrible.
It is a source of light used by miners. <cf>This is a little special.
<cf>It's made of "audal crystals" that don't emit soot, and <cf>it's very expensive.
I was carrying a barrel filled with these crystals. <cf>But I bumped into a group of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>.
I ate the foam, abandoned the cart and ran away,<cf>......<cf> and when I returned, the crystals were gone!
My master, Mr. Baumann, is a strict man. <cf>But even then, I was not well made......
<cf>I'm sorry I made you do this. <cf>Please tell your master what happened.
<cf>Tell Mr. Baumann that I lost my luggage.
Oh, what? <cf>There's a message from that bastard Isaac?
He threw out the ...... "Audal crystal"! <cf>Hey, that's a lot of damage!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>is a bargain, as you can see. <cf>I'm sure they've got it all split up by now.
Isaac's fool is ....... He's a son of a bitch, but <cf>I see a little potential in that young guy.
He ain't got the strength, he ain't got the guts. <cf>But he's got an eye for the stones.
It's a talent. It would be a waste to destroy it for something as trivial as this.
Oh, yes!　If you <cf>get the crystals back</cf>, it'll all come full circle!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> would not be so difficult. <cf>You seem to have a lot of skill.
<cf>Get the Audal Crystal back and bring it back to Isaac.
<cf>If you can get it back, I'd like to join you, too. <cf>I don't want to make a big deal out of this, either.
Would you help us and that bastard Isaac out?　Please!
I need you to take down the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/> that are around here. They should have <cf>"Audal Crystals".
When you have collected the required number, <cf>deliver them to that bastard Isaac.
Oh, this! <cf>The "Audal crystals" that I lost!
<cf>Thank you, for my sake! <cf>Thank you for going to the trouble of getting it back for me. ......
...... What? <cf>Master bowed to the adventurer......
...... I see. <cf>I'll go tell my master the truth after all!
<cf>My master saved me even though I ran away without making any sense.
<cf>I put the adventurers through a lot of trouble. <cf>I wouldn't be a man if I didn't apologize.
Let's go to your master. <cf>Come with me, adventurer.
I want to settle this story once and for all, and <cf>thank you for your hospitality.
Oh, there you are. <cf>Too late, young man.
Oh, master, I'm ......
You big idiot! <cf> Do you know why I'm angry?
<cf> It's not because you stole the Audal crystal. <cf>It's because you ran away with your tail between your legs from your responsibility!
Failure is not an option. It's no wonder you have trouble remembering things. <cf>But be honest with me!
<cf> Or you'll lose your job and your friends. <cf>Are we clear?
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, master! <cf>I have done an unforgivable thing!
<cf>I hid my failure and brought others into it. <cf>It's all my fault!　I am sorry!
That's fine. <cf>You should have done that from the beginning!
<cf>I'm not trying to get you fired. <cf>We're shorthanded too.
My son, who was supposed to be my heir, has left home, so <cf>I have no choice but to teach you guys my craft.
If you're ready, <cf>I'll hold your ass as long as I can. Remember.
Oyasama ....... Thank you very much. <cf>I will be forever in your debt!
Let me thank you again, adventurer. <cf>Thank you so much!
You've been a big help. <cf>Thank you. Thanks to you, guys.
<cf>I'll make sure this young fellow gets a good workout. <cf>If you ever need anything else, please let me know.
<cf>Thank you very much for the "Audal crystals!
<cf>My master is angry with me, but I'm doing my best. <cf>It is strangely easy to find good stones these days!
I wonder if the adventurers brought you <cf>good luck too. Hahaha!
Hmmm, what's this vein of ore? <cf> I don't remember writing this stuff down.
I'm curious, but I'm also busy at work. ...... <cf>I wonder if there's anyone I can ask.
Oh, thanks for taking care of it. <cf>I'm a miner's boss around here.
<cf>I'm a miner's boss around here, and since my job is such, I've been making <cf>memoranda</cf> about the vein. I've been doing it for 30 years now.
I know all the veins around here. <cf>I'm supposed to. ......
<cf>I found a vein in the memorandum that I didn't know existed. <cf>When did it happen, and in different handwriting than mine.
I have an idea who wrote it. <cf>I'm more interested in whether there really is such a vein.
That's what I want Anta to confirm. <cf>Go to the place mentioned in the memorandum and check it out.
<cf>It also politely mentions the stones that can be found there. <cf>If you find the real thing, it's the best proof of all.
First of all, it's a vein of "sharp striped stone. <cf>Will you bring it to me when you find it? Thank you.
<cf>Look for the Litze Caverns. <cf>I'm sure you'll find the "Pointed Striped Stone.
If you find it, will you bring it here? <cf>Thank you. <cf>Thank you!
<cf>"Pointed Striped Stone" from Baumann's memorandum.
There are several identical stones lying nearby. <cf>Let's bring them back and report back to Baumann.
You've checked the location in the memorandum.
This is the "Pointed Striped Stone". <cf>Which one is it? ....... Oh, seriously?
This is "serpentine copper. <cf>That's not the kind of stone you'd find that close to the surface of the earth!
<cf>The crystals when rusted are used as medicine. <cf>It can be sold for a fair price.
<cf> It was a little troublesome to dig up. <cf>I'd be very grateful if there was a vein like this.
I'm looking forward to the next place. <cf>I hear you can find "red outcropping stones" here.
Go check out the same locality. <cf>Thank you!
Next is "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>". <cf>You should be able to find the "Red Outcropping Stone".
<cf>"The Red Outcropping Stone" from Baumann's memorandum.
<cf>"The Stone of the Red Outcropping" was found? <cf> Which, let me see.
...... "[burning steel]"? <cf>This is pretty awesome.
It's a metal made of engram and iron bonded deep underground. <cf>It has high heat resistance.
<cf>It is used in automobile engines. <cf>It's a rare ore and a luxury item.
I thought I knew everything about these mountains, but <cf>there are still new veins of ore.
I'm suddenly inclined to trust the memorandum. <cf>Can you help me with the next place?
Look for something called "white sheet rock". <cf>I'm kinda looking forward to seeing what you come up with this time.
Look for "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>". <cf>You should find a "white slab stone".
<cf>"white slab stone" from Baumann's memorandum.
I've been researching the memorandum for a long time now. <cf> Sorry for the trouble.
Is this the "white slab stone"? <cf>...... hmm?　This is another rare find.
This is "Buffalian marble. <cf>It's not an ore, but a kind of ancient relic.
It is said that the Buffalian gods created it by altering the <cf> earth to build their temples.
It is strong and light, and is a first-class building material, but it has to be delivered to the <cf>Baphalian cult</cf>.
I'll just report it and let the Order dig up the rest. <cf>At least we'll get a reward.
Okay, the next one is the last. <cf>I hear you can get "shiny rocks" here.
One more effort, please!
Next is the "shining stone". <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>" is said to be located at
This is the last one. Thank you. <cf>Will you bring it here when you find it?
<cf>The Shining Stone from Baumann's memorandum.
<cf>"The Shining Stone" was found? <cf>Good work. That's the last of it.
This is ....... Oh, man, I can't believe it. <cf>Gold.
<cf>The mines around here should have been dug up long ago!
Oh my god. ....... <cf>My loss. I can't believe I missed this.
Only <cf>me and my son Einar can touch this memorandum.
Einar is the one who added the note. <cf>I didn't know he was this good a connoisseur of mineral deposits: ......
He had the gift of seeing the stones, <cf>and he was a strong man.
He could have been the best miner I've ever seen. <cf>But he said he was going to be an actor.
<cf>He just walked out of the house. <cf>I guess the note was just a souvenir.
I was going to let her do whatever she wanted if she wanted to be an actor. <cf>...... No, I still think that.
But it's too close to call to see this. <cf>I want Einar to be in charge of this mine.
<cf>...... I'm talking about my own people now. I'm sorry. <cf>Thanks for all your running around.
Thanks, man. <cf>This is your reward. Keep it.
If you ever see my son Einar, ......<cf> no, not really.
Don't tell him anything yet. <cf>A parent shouldn't mess with a child.
A top-notch adventurer is not just about competence. <cf>They're also full of star power.
<cf>They have a unique aura, a sense of presence. <cf>You can tell a gem like that just by looking at them.
I've finally found you. <cf>You are the first adventurer producer!
<cf>I am Barni, your Adventurer Producer. <cf>I fully support you in your endeavors.
<cf>I'm still a good judge of what to ask for. <cf>I'll bring you a good job, you can count on me.
You accomplish the request and are very successful! <cf>You'll get an achievement and a cool second name.
That's how you build your reputation and complete more advanced requests. <cf>It's my role to operate this place efficiently.
Eventually, your exploits will be turned into an adventure story or play, <cf>and marketed to the world at large!
Your fame will grow and your popularity will only increase! <cf>You may even get a client to call on you in the future!
<cf>You'll be rewarded handsomely. <cf>You'll get paid just for talking to new adventurers!
What do you think?　<cf>We're going to get this dream life. <cf>To do that, you'd better listen to my instructions.
Well then, this time I'm going to ask you to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>. <cf>Lately, the bandits who appear in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/> seem to be on a roll.
People are annoyed with them, so that's why they're getting so much attention. <cf>You will now make a name for yourself as the "Bandit Killer"!
Come on, it's your first step to glory. <cf>Slap the <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/> with your <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>!
Go on!　My "Bandit Killer"!
Go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/> and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>!
Welcome back. <cf>It looks like you defeated "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_00_01001"/>".
Oops, don't be hasty. <cf>You mustn't be satisfied with this level of achievement.
You are strong enough and have star power. <cf>With the right production, you could win the world.
<cf>As a "bandit killer" who takes down evil bandits who attack people, <cf>you'll be super popular!
So, let's <cf>add another "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>" with "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>" and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>" as well!
In the meantime, I'm going to sell it to the settlement office. <cf>When you're done, please come to the settlement office's tent.
By the time you return, <cf>your success story will unfold......
Now, go to "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>". <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>" Go kick some ass!
<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>" and take down "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>"!
I'll be at the Salaamzat pioneer station. <cf>When you're done, come over there.
Have you finished defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E300_03_00_01001"/>? <cf>Thank you.
Just a moment, please. <cf>I'm in the middle of a conversation right now.
Hey, can you think about this some more? <cf>This is an opportunity for both of us.
So, <cf>we are not looking for such people at the Pioneer Bureau at this time.
<cf>We have other people taking down bandits. <cf>We can't give preferential treatment to certain adventurers.
Taking down bandits is just an outpost! <cf>We'll connect it to bigger jobs in the future.
What do you think?　This star-studded standing! <cf>Bandit Killer's strength is nothing like this!
<cf>Then come back after you've done the big job. <cf>Then we'll talk. Excuse me.
<cf>Wait a minute! <cf>Why don't you listen to me?　To begin with: ......
Oh, my God! <cf>The pioneering agency is too stubborn.
But if you give up now, you can't call yourself a producer.
<cf>You did a great job! <cf>I knew I was on to something.
<cf>This time it was too easy, that's why it didn't work. <cf>Next time I'll bring you something so big that you won't be able to complain.
<cf>Until then, don't forget my name and my face. <cf>See you later!
I'm not the Bandit Killer. <cf>You're doing a great job today. I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
<cf>Next time, I'll find you a big job where you'll be well known and have a great track record. You'll just have to wait and see!
Hmmm...I'm not sure I should be so blunt. <cf>I don't want things to get awkward. ......
I don't know how to treat people in this situation. <cf>I don't think it's right to meddle in my subordinate's private life, do you?
I'm sorry for taking you on. <cf>Akka, our miner, hasn't been working at all lately.
It's not that he's sick or injured. <cf>I think something is bothering him.
<cf> I mean, Akka is worried about something!
It's a private thing. <cf>Akka has a girlfriend.
And she came to me for advice about ["]proposing["]. <cf>I said, "[You should] just do it.
And then a little while later, <cf>Acka went crazy.
I mean, you know?　My advice was bad and <cf>Acca got turned down for a proposal. ......
I'm responsible for this, right? <cf>No, maybe not.
But it feels like it! <cf>Ah, I shouldn't have said anything else!
Worst case scenario, I'll have to be the one to make it up to you! <cf>Please!　Go clarify the situation!
Adventurer?　What do you want from me?
...... You're worried about Rasha because you're not doing your job?
I'm not worried about anything. <cf>My life is going great!
I'd say ....... <cf>I guess I can't fake it anymore.
Actually, I talked to <cf>Rasha</cf> about proposing to my girlfriend.
<cf>I lost the ring of silver and red jade</cf> that I was going to propose to her with afterwards.
I mean, it's not like I failed to propose or anything. <cf>It's more like a problem before that. ......
<cf>I think I dropped it in the river at the Litze Cavern in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>.
So I was dented. <cf>It affected my work too. Oh, how pathetic!
What's ......?　Rasha <cf>thought</cf> the proposal was a failure and ......
You're trying to make up for it yourself! <cf>Yeah, that's not good!
I haven't said anything to her yet! <cf>Of course it's going to get complicated!
Yes, it is!　Adventurer, please! <cf>Go find me a ring!
As long as I have that, it'll go full circle! <cf>I'll keep Rasha in line, I'll keep her in line!
The Ring of Silver and Red Jade is in the river at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>!　I'm asking for it!
Did you <cf>find</cf> the ring of silver and crimson jade that I dropped?
It should be in the river at <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>! <cf>Hurry up and find it!
I found "The Ring of Silver and Red Jade". <cf>The names of Akka and the woman are engraved on it.
It's definitely a proposal ring. <cf>I'll deliver it to Akka.
Adventurer! <cf> You found the "Ring of Silver and Red Jade" for me.
Thank you for saving me! I can manage with this. <cf> Well, Rasha found out in the end.
You idiot, already!　If you lost the ring, <cf>you should have talked to me sooner.
I was worried about you, you know? <cf>I almost asked her by accident.
[Was Akka's proposal really that bad? ["]<cf> Oh, my God.
No, seriously, give me a break! <cf>Mr. Rasha even gave me an advance on my salary.
I couldn't afford to cause you any more trouble. <cf>That's why I didn't tell you.
But I'm sorry I put a hole in your work. <cf>I'm sorry about that.
<cf>You are an important asset to our company, so I don't care about the money.
I'm going to make sure you continue to earn money. <cf>It would hurt us more if your hands were tied.
Anyway, if you found the ring, that settles it. <cf>Next time I expect a good report!
I'm in your debt! <cf>I'll keep working hard!
Oh no, that was close. <cf>You almost ruined my man's proposal.
You, too, thank you very much. <cf>You did a great job!
Akka seems happy these days.
Sounds like the proposal went well. <cf>What do you think?　I should probably ask her for details!
Oh, work? <cf>Adventurers have their work cut out for them!
I'd ask for a favor from you if I could, but <cf> it's a bit of a big deal.
<cf>I can't make a request unless the priest there agrees to it.
I'm in trouble too. <cf>I think he would agree if I was introduced by someone else. ......
<cf>If I ever get introduced as an adventurer, <cf>I'll talk to him again.
Oy. <cf>Welcome to such a place!
Hmmm ....... You must be the one. <cf>Jake, you're the one who complimented me.
<cf>A good shot and a good talker. <cf>I hear you're a top-notch adventurer to be trusted.
Would you do me one favor.
There is a doctor in Lalpar named Volker. <cf>He has a somewhat tricky job for you.
I need your help with him. <cf> I am, as you can see, already retired.
If I say my introduction, Volker will understand. <cf>Please do me a favor.
When you find Volker in Lalpar, <cf>we'll talk to him.
Oh, what's up? <cf>You looking for a job?
You know what I'm asking for. ...... <cf>I'm afraid I can't be too open about it.
<cf>I can't ask for a job unless the priest here is satisfied.
I'd be happy to refer you to someone. ......
Hmm, what? <cf> Introduced by the guy on the roof of the pioneer station?
I see!　Then don't worry. <cf>I was introduced by a former top adventurer of the Pioneer Bureau!
<cf> Well, I'll leave it to you. <cf>There's a problem. Help me out.
Oh, you'll take care of it? <cf>Mr. Priest over here will tell you what's going on.
I'm Kilmeyer. Pleased to meet you. <cf> I was sent by the Order of Buffalia.
First of all, this request is confidential. <cf>I don't want you to mention my work outside.
That's how I chose the people. <cf>I'm sorry if I offended you.
Now, let's cut to the chase.
If you're an adventurer, you may have heard about this. <cf>There's a rumor going around these days that
[Rumor has it that <cf>avaritia is created by the transformation of ordinary animals, subhumans, and humans[,].......
Let me assure you, this is not true. <cf>At least, this is an event that has not been confirmed by the Order.
I think the fear of avaritia has given birth to<cf>an unproven story.
But some of them really believe it. <cf>I wonder if one day I'll be changed too.
And lately, there's a strange drug on the market.
<cf>Someone is selling them, and they are called "avaritia prophylactics. <cf>Someone is selling it, apparently.
<cf>They're obviously shady, though. <cf>Adventurers and <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/>the like are falling for it.
By the way, I hear they're going for a hell of a lot of money. <cf> For a knee-jerk reaction!　Gahaha!
And I need you <cf> to get it for me so I can find out what the hell it is.
It's too late for it to get out to the public. <cf>We want to make sure we take care of it while we can.
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" in Asteria Plain. <cf>They're going around in that place <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/>.
They're a bit of a tough crowd that haunts that place. <cf>Be careful not to let your guard down!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/> and get <cf>"Avaritia Preventive Medicine".
Defeat the "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>" in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>". He should have <cf>"Avaritia Prophylaxis".
The <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_00_01001"/> in that area are tough. <cf>Be careful.
Oh, and thanks for your help. <cf>Did you get the "Avaritia Prophylaxis"?
Oh, this is the one. <cf>So, let's do some analysis.
Gahaha!　<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/> idiots! <cf>You believed this stuff was medicine?
This is all water mixed with flavoring and sugar. <cf>It's just a little sweet juice.
<cf>If you drink this stuff, you'll feel better. <cf>It does have that effect, though.
They're sweet, they're sweet! <cf>Only for sugar!　Gahaha!
I knew you just scammed me with a fake one. <cf>I guess that's a relief, first of all.
But it seems that whoever made this counterfeit medicine has knowledge. <cf>At least they know about avaritia.
Unless you're a priest or an adventurer in direct contact with that thing,<cf> you'd only know it from myths or fairy tales.
Without some knowledge, <cf>the idea of prophylactics, etc., would never have occurred to them.
If it's a priest involved, he's a ......<cf>traitor. They shouldn't even be allowed to exist.
I would try to follow the route the drugs are being sold. <cf>If anything else comes up, I need to turn to you again.
You have proven yourself in this one case. <cf>Be proud of yourself.
Kilmeyer is<cf>busy checking up on the drugs.
<cf>I gave the ones you brought me to the neighborhood kids.
It was a cheap knockoff, but <cf>we made them happy.
<cf> Wooden carvings in the shape of "Kamikazuken no Omihashira" are the most popular souvenirs.
<cf>If you display it in your home, you will surely feel grateful.
I heard that wood carvings of the "Mikabashira" are good souvenirs.
I heard it's supposed to be beneficial. ...... <cf>They don't have the materials to make them now.
That's too bad. If you see a craftsman named Uro, <cf>[let me buy one next time], please tell him.
<cf>If I see a craftsman named Uro, I'll ask him about it.
Oh, welcome. <cf>I'm the one who makes the wooden carvings for "Kamikake no Omashira"!
It's a popular souvenir from Lalpar. <cf>They are often bought as souvenirs of the pilgrimage.
<cf>I'm sorry to bother you, but I don't have the materials to make the carvings at this time.
What?　Did you hear the tourists saying, <cf>[let me buy one next time]?
That makes me happy. <cf>When I hear stories like that, it makes me want to go the extra mile.
<cf>I can't whine about it, you know. <cf>Could you do me one favor?
The timber I use comes from <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"
There are <cf>traces of ancient people living in that area.
There are traces of ancient people living in that area, and <cf>'ancient wood' that is so old that its name is not even known can be found there.
<cf>It's easy to work and very strong. <cf>It hardly corrodes at all!
<cf>But it's a lot of work to go get it. <cf>There are monsters out there.
<cf>The only way is to ask an adventurer like you. <cf>I want you to bring me the "Ancient Wood".
<value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>" I want you to find it. <cf>You should be able to find "The Ancient Wood".
Did you bring the "ancient wood"? <cf>Thank you very much.
How was <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>? <cf>I think it was quite a nice view!
...... Oh?　It's all little pieces, isn't it? <cf>This is a little strange.
It's very rugged and rough, but ....... <cf>Some of the pieces have been worked on!
...... Oh, it looks familiar. <cf>This is the same make as the goblin's tools!
It seems that goblins are raiding the area and collecting <cf>"ancient wood" </cf>.
<cf>There's a new enemy of business, you know. <cf>This is no good for business!
Could you please search the goblin settlements? <cf>There might be some 'big old timber' there.
We can't do our job without it. <cf>Please, please, please, please!
<value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>I need you to <cf>search</cf> for a goblin settlement.
You will find a large ancient wood.
I found "The Big Old Wood".
Let's deliver it to Uro.
Did you find the Big Ancient Timber?
......Yes, this is it. <cf> If it's this big, we can use it for our work!
Oh. This one's already been ......<cf>processed into woodcarvings.
Let's call it "Goblin Wood Carving". <cf>......It's similar to the "Mikabashira of the Gods"!
They are decorated with <cf>images of evil, but ......
Maybe they have their own mythology, and the <cf>"Kamikake no Mikabashira" plays an <cf>important role in it!
Goblin culture....... <cf>Although I had no idea such a thing existed.
<cf>I feel bad about taking it lying down when I see it like this!
Even though we don't understand them, <cf>they must have worked very hard to carve them in their own way.
I'm sorry to keep repeating this, but <cf>could I ask you to return this to the village?
As a woodworker, I can't use this as material. <cf>I'm sorry, but please do.
<cf>I want you to return the "Goblin Wood Carving" to the goblin settlement of <value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>.
I have returned the "Goblin Woodcarving" to its original state.
I'll tell Uro.
You <cf>returned</cf> the "Goblin Woodcarving" to the goblin settlement in <ld002_W"/>. Thank you.
That wood carving has given me a lot to think about.
From our point of view, the belief in goblins is <cf>just a superstition that has nothing to do with the god of Buffalia.
But I guess they think <cf> that about us, too!
We see the same "kamikaze no mihashira", but we <cf> fit a different story into it.
We are both looking at the world through completely different eyes. <cf>even though they have their own language and art
It's ......<cf>somewhat sad that we don't understand or can't understand each other
And ...... are we really telling the right story? <cf>I sometimes feel like that!
No, ...... this is blasphemy against the God of Buffalia. <cf>I just want you to forget it.
Thanks a lot. <cf>I feel like you've given me some insight.
<cf>I'm trying my hand at marquetry with the first little piece of lumber you brought me!
<cf>The combination of the pieces gives a different impression of the wood. <cf>This is interesting. I think it will sell well.
Yes, I think this is the place to do business. <cf>That looks good.
Now, we're going to get busy!
Oh, man. <cf>I'm trying to do business here now.
<cf>But there's some guy attacking travelers on the road between Salamzat and Litze.
Who is he?　That's the thing. ......
Apparently it's a female adventurer. <cf>There are a couple of guys who say they've seen her.
Her name is Tulka. <cf>Punish him.
They say he's in the Evergreen Desert at <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>.
What kind of adventurer would do such a thing ......? <cf> Anyway, look for Tulka.
There is a female adventurer named Tulka in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>.
I hear she's been attacking travelers. <cf>Go and teach her a lesson!
You've come to punish me because I'm attacking travelers?
You must be joking. <cf>I would never do such a despicable thing.
I still call myself an adventurer. <cf>I would never hurt anyone.
Who in the world said that?
A street vendor guy named Garb......? <cf> That name doesn't sound familiar.
But I do know of one who claims to attack travelers. <cf>The identity is a variant of the Canny Mook Archer.
It is called "<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>" and <cf>is more formidable than other Canny Mook Archers.
I ran into him once and chased him off. <cf>Maybe they saw us fight?
Okay, maybe that's why you misunderstood me.
Sorry. Would you <cf>help me to clear my name?
I want to take down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>.
But I may miss it if I go it alone. <cf>We need you to split up and look for him.
He is in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/> in the Montenol Valley. <cf>The one who finds him will take him down.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>" was defeated? <cf>As expected.
I struck out on my part. <cf>But I did get rid of the mooks who I thought were his minions.
At any rate,<cf>I'm really glad it was you who came to me.
If it had been another adventurer who had accepted my request, <cf>we might have been fighting under a misunderstanding.
No one would have benefited from that, you know.
Now, you're going to report back to your client, aren't you? <cf>Will you allow me to accompany you?
It wasn't Tsurka who was attacking the travelers. <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>" I have to let them know.
Oh, how's that working out for you? <cf>Did you punish the female adventurer?
Hmm?　You?
You are the client? <cf> I am Tulka. I'm an adventurer.
Tsurka is ....... <cf> Eh!　Hey, why did you bring me here!
I thought you were an adventurer who attacks travelers!
That's a misunderstanding. <cf>It's preposterous that I would attack travelers!
The culprit is "<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>". <cf>The adventurer who took your request took him down.
And he also cleared my name.
Eh!　Is that true?
That's a very hasty conclusion. Oh, man.
Mr. Tsurka. <cf>I'm sorry for the misunderstanding!
No, I hope you understand.
The monster that was attacking the travelers is gone. <cf> That's something to rejoice about.
Yes, it is. <cf>Now I can start my business with peace of mind!
You're quite the adventurer, aren't you? <cf>Good thing I asked. Thanks a lot!
Oh, it's you! <cf>How are you doing?
I'm setting up business, as you can see. <cf>Maybe I'll ask you for something else.
Let's see, east is right, ....... <cf>Left is the one with the shield: ......
Okay, okay! <cf>You got the general idea of where we're going?
Um, sorry! <cf>"Claw marks of the giant dragon" is that way, right?
Oh, it's okay!　I know. <cf>I'm just asking!
Well then!
It's totally different from "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" <cf>It ran in the direction of the day after tomorrow. ......
I might be lost. <cf>If I see him somewhere, I'll call out to him.
...... if you can find him.
Um, sorry. ...... <cf>Is this where "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon" is?
I thought I was headed straight from Asterlys, but <cf>I found myself in a desert like this,...... hot!
I don't think I've ever been in a place this hot! <cf>Please show me the way!
Thanks! <cf>So, which way is "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon"?
..................?
.............................. ......?
<span size="Big">...... eh, eh? </>
Gosh, I'm sorry! <cf>I didn't understand you after you explained it to me so carefully!
I've always been like that! <cf>I couldn't remember the way at all. ......
Please. <cf>Take me to the "Claws of the Giant Dragon"!
Wow!　I'm here!
Thank you for bringing me here! <cf> So this is the Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon!
I would have been lost without you!
I'm looking for an ore called "Featherstone". I think I can find it in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>".
I've been asked to do this by a scholar. <cf>That's how I wanted to get here.
So, you know, that ....... <cf>I was wondering if you could help me find it?
...... Actually, I've already forgotten how to get here. <cf>I can never get home alone!
Woohoo, my stupidity!
I want you to find me 5 "Featherstones". <cf> For my silly me, too: ......
I'll pick them up too, of course. <cf>When you're done, let me join you back here.
Da, it's okay!　I won't go far. <cf>I can come back here indeed!　Maybe ......
I'm sorry!　I'm sorry! <cf>Please do take care of me!
I need you to find <cf>"Featherstone" in <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>.
I'll look for it right here in the neighborhood. <cf>I'll be in trouble if I can't come back ......
You picked up the Featherstone for me. <cf>Thank you!
Featherstone is a mysterious stone. <cf>If you hit it like this: ......
<cf> and it becomes lighter and floats!　Isn't that interesting?
So says the scholarly teacher. <cf> that when you hit it, it changes its internal structure.
Some say that if you leave it alone, the wind will blow it <cf>somewhere else</cf>.
Haha, sounds like me.
This lightening property has been used for a long time, <cf>and is often found in the ruins of Buffalia.
In some cases, they become lighter when you hit them. <cf>It was used to carry heavy things.
Thanks to you, I was able to accomplish my request. <cf>Thank you so much!
Well then, let's head back to Asterlys.
Of course, because I forgot the way. <cf>...... you can point me in the direction of Asterlys.
Don't worry. It's close by, so you won't get lost! <cf>I forgot the way, but ...... it's okay!
<cf>...... maybe. I'm sure, yeah. <cf>I'm sure it's ...... okay...... but
Asterries is that way....... <cf>Minsterhorn is this way......
The top is north, so ....... <cf>Okay!　I think I've got it about figured out!　...... maybe
Huh, I'm the strongest and loneliest hero ....... <cf>No one can stand against me.
My strongest position is unassailable! <cf>Unless someone else surpasses me!
We meet again! <cf>You have surpassed me, the strongest and lone Soldier!
The old me is no more. ...... <cf>I am the strongest and lone hero reborn!
I challenge you to a match once again!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/> has appeared in this "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>".
The one who kills the most of them wins.
Listen and be amazed. <cf>I have already killed 9 <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_00_01001"/>!
If you kill 10 <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_01001"/>, you win!
When you win, <cf>I'll tell you why I'm a hero!
Hoo ....... It won't be that easy. Try killing 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Try to kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>.
If you can do that, you win. <cf>If you can!
<span size="Big">What? </>
Did you really kill 10 <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_00_00_01001"/>?
Damn ......!　I have to admit. <cf> You win. ......
As promised, I'll tell you. <cf>I'll tell you why I'm a hero.
This world is a wild place. <cf>You go a little off the beaten path, monsters will attack you.
Adventurers and Buffalian guards would help. <cf>But if you don't, the villages are overrun by them.
Those without power can only hide, kill their breath, <cf>and pray that the storm will pass.
It's hard. ...... <cf>That's why I became an adventurer
To be a hero who saves a small village!
If only a hero had been there, <cf>my village would not have perished. ......
...... No, nothing! <cf>Hero doesn't deserve sentimentality!
Look forward!　And shatter your destiny! <cf>Now, on to the next match!
This time, your opponent is different. <cf>The target is the big one who runs rampant in the Montenol valley.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>"....... <cf>This guy is trolling around "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>".
He may eventually attack Litze. <cf>We must defeat this guy before that happens.
It is the heroes who respond to the people's grief!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>"<cf>Who can defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/> first? It's a game!
We will defeat <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>" with "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"!
First one to take it down wins! <cf>Huff, if you want to go first, go. I'm ready.
Okay, I'm ready. <cf>It's time to go. ......
You already defeated "<value type="enemyName" id="E000_21_02_01001"/>"!
I didn't think you'd lose. ...... <cf>How swift!　You've gone beyond time!
All right. This time I lost! <cf>But I won't give up!
Heroes always rise again! <cf>Farewell until the next time we fight!
...... and before that. <cf>Accept your reward for defeating the monster!
You have successfully saved the people. <cf> I'll leave the title of Hero to you!
Then, once again, farewell!
A new hero. <cf> Wait for the time when I rise again!
Do not fear. I will be strong. <cf>I will never let you down!
<cf> I'm looking for the legendary flower. I'm looking for the legendary flower. <cf>But it's a hard one to find!
Huff....... The only clue is the legend. <cf>It must be a beautiful and fragile flower!
Huff....... Thanks. <cf>I'm glad to have your help.
I'm looking for a desert flower. <cf>A very rare flower, as legend has it.
Its name is the "Light Flower". <cf>Hu....... A flower of light in the desert. ...... so fragile.
Hu ....... <cf>I need you to gather some information in Salamzat.
A merchant named Ardlung. <cf>I heard he was talking about "light flowers".
Hu....... I'll continue to gather information here in this oasis. <cf>Let me know if you find any clues.
Hu ....... I'll take care of this, you go! <cf> What the heck.
Hu ....... Talk to <cf>Mr. Ardlung, a merchant in Salamzert.
I'm sure he'll know about the "Light Flower."
Hello, adventurer. How can I help you?
Oh, you are talking about "The Light Flower"? <cf>Yes, I have heard rumors.
I am a jeweler, and it is said that <cf>the "luminous flower" is as valuable as jewelry.
<cf>The petals of the "luminous flower" have the property of shining at night. <cf>Their brilliance is said to be like that of gemstones.
And it can be processed to look like a real gemstone!
I would love to see it!
I sent out a survey team before, but we couldn't find <cf>"Kouka".
Oh yes. At that time, I talked to a <cf>scholar</cf> named Ms. Ferena.
I believe she lives in Salamzat. If you are looking for <cf>'Kouka', why don't you visit her?
I'm sure Mr. Ferena knows more about it than I do.
<cf>Mr. Ferena knows more about the legend of "Kouka" than I do.
<cf>Since you live in Salamzert, why don't you pay her a visit?
Oh, adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
The "Light Flower"<cf>......?　You're looking for something unusual.
Yes, I am. There is a legend in this region. <cf>It is a mysterious flower that blooms in the desert and emits light.
<cf>A long time ago, there was a man who had a "light flower" in his hand. <cf>A long time ago, there was a man who had a "light flower" in his hand. <cf>The man was so delighted that he wanted to sell it for money.
<cf>The man was greedy, and he raised the price anyway. <cf>It was a rare flower, so the price was unbelievable!
<cf>In the end, a very wealthy man decided to buy the "glow flower". <cf>But ......
The "Hikaribana" died before the deal was concluded.
This is a kind of fairy tale. <cf>[Don't] be greedy[,]" the moral of the story, you know.
There are people who really believe this story and look for "Koka," but <cf>I've never heard of anyone who got it.
It's just like the fairy tale. <cf>It means that greed does not work.
Like, "["]The man kissed the night sky and got the "Koka"["].
I don't know what it means, but there is such a passage. <cf>For your information.
["]The man kissed the night sky and got the 'light flower' ["]......
I don't know what it means, but you might want to tell <cf>your client
Hu....... <cf>I see you've heard about "Kouka" without incident.
Hou...... a passage from a fairy tale? <cf>["]The man kissed the night sky and got the 'light flower'["]......
Hu....... <cf>Kissing the night sky is such a romantic story!
Hu....... I heard about it from a priest of the Buffalian religion. <cf>The "Light Flower" is a kind of Buffalian heritage, apparently.
Its petals emit light even after they fall. <cf>The ancients tried to overcome the darkness of the night with it.
<cf>The source of its light is its strong life force, which blooms even in the desert. <cf>["]When joy fell on the sand, the flower bloomed["]"].
Hu....... I see. <cf>I understand. I know the truth about "Koka".
<cf> And when you kiss the night sky, you get the "light flower". <cf> And when joy falls on the sand, it blooms.
'Kiss' is 'joy. <cf>Fu ....... So all you need is water to make the plants happy.
When the man in the fairy tale got the 'light flower', <cf>it must have been raining by chance!
Huff....... Amazing. <cf>It rained faintly around here a few days ago.
If you try to collect at "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>", you <cf>may find the "light flower"!
Hoo ....... <cf>But be prepared in case your guess is wrong!
I for one will try to find a way to kiss the night sky. <cf>Huff, wouldn't it be nice if we could really kiss.
<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/> I'll leave it to you to collect it. <cf>Go find me some "glow flowers".
Did you find the "glow flower"?
<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>" and collect the plants. <cf>You might find 'Kouka'.
Huh ....... That's what I'm talking about. <cf>It looks like you got the 'light flower'.
Hu....... <cf>It's wonderful. Too beautiful.
I can see why people in the past sought it out.
Hu....... <cf>A flower born by the miracle of the Buffalian gods?
Even if it is destined to wither eventually, <cf>I will never forget its beauty and fleeting light.
Romantic, isn't it? <cf>This is why I'll never stop being an adventurer.
Hu ....... Thank you. <cf>I couldn't have gotten it without your help.
Hu ....... This is your reward. <cf> Take it without saying a word.
Hu ....... <cf>The legend of the "Light Flower" could not have been solved alone.
<cf> I love it when adventurers cooperate with each other.
I'm just mixing up a potion.
You say the smell is too strong? <cf> Hahaha, that's what comes with good medicine.
Do you know an adventurer lady named Tulka?
I heard she's not feeling well. <cf> I'm worried about her.
Tulka saved me from a monster once.
I wanted to thank her for that. <cf>I want you to deliver the medicine I concocted.
I tried to visit him once, but I heard that Tulka was not feeling well, but he went out <cf>to accept the request.
He said he is in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>. <cf>Find him and give him the medicine.
Could you deliver the medicine to the adventurer, Tsurka.
She should be in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>"
Geehaw......goho......goho......
Hmm ......?　What is it?
Goho...... eh? <cf>Did Quan, the medicine man, ask you to bring him some medicine?
Goho...... I see. I appreciate the sentiment, but...
I'm on my way to <value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>defeat him now. <cf>I can't just throw the request away in the middle of a mission.
Nor can we succumb to disease, etc. <cf>So, no medicine is needed. ...... ugh!
Gosh, gosh gosh gosh!　Ghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghooghoogho!
Ugh. ...... You want me to take it easy on ......?
Damn ...... that doesn't look good. ...... <cf>But it's harder than I thought it would be......
Sorry. Can you...... take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/> for me......
It's an urgent request ....... <cf> I can't take the medicine for that ...... reason.
When I finish the request, I'll go to Quan and talk to him.
I promise you. So, I'm sorry, but <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/>I need you to take down
Gosh, gosh!　I need you to take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>. ......
Come back when you're done. <cf>Let's go to Quan together...... gho, gho!
Gho, gho, gho! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_01_00_01001"/> for taking down the enemy?
Thanks so much. <cf>Yeah...... my health seems to be getting worse......
Gosh, gosh gosh ......! <cf>I know I should take medicine......
Anyway, let's go back to Quan once ......
As promised, I'll tell him what happened. <cf>I owe you a debt of gratitude for taking the request off my shoulders.
Hi, Quan. ...... Gosh, gosh, gosh.
Tsurka!　What's the matter? <cf>Are you that sick?
You have the medicine that was delivered to you. Take it right now!
Gobble gobble......No, I can't take that medicine......
I hate to say it,......<cf>I can't take bitter medicine,......
I'm ashamed to call myself an adventurer. <cf>That's why I avoided the potion itself.
I'm sorry for springing favors on you or anything like that. ......Gosh!
I didn't know that. ...... <cf>Then you should have told me earlier.
<cf>Then I'll mix you up a less bitter potion. <cf> Leave it to me.
You. I'm sorry, but I need you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/> and pick up a herb called <cf>"blue-amazuru".
With that, we can make a medicine that is not bitter.
I'll let Tsurka rest here. <cf>Thank you for your continued help.
<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/><cf>Pick up a herb called 'Aoamaduru' for me.
I am sorry for asking you so many things. <cf>I just need a little more help.
Did you find "Aoamaduru"?
Thank you! <cf>With this, I can make a medicine that is not bitter.
Come on, Tsurka. <cf>I think even you can drink this.
Gosh!　...... sorry ......
It's true...... it's not bitter. <cf>I can drink this......
Phew...... I feel better....... <cf>The coughing seems to have calmed down.
<cf>Good. <cf>All I need now is a good night's rest and I'll be fine.
<cf>Next time you're not feeling well, <cf>you can talk to me right away.
Oh. <cf>I'll do that from now on.
But <cf>I'd like you to keep the story about my inability to take bitter medicine a <cf> secret.
Can you not tell anyone, either? <cf>Me, you, and Quan, it's a secret between the three of us.
After all, you know. <cf>I'm just so embarrassed. ......
Hello. <cf>Are you feeling any physical discomfort?
Tsurka has started to take his medicine for me. <cf>Thanks to you.
I've been cleaning out the attic, <cf>there's so much dust.
It's a place I've been neglecting for a long time. <cf>I found something tucked away that I had completely forgotten about!
I found something in the attic of my barn that <cf>seemed<cf> to be of Buffalian heritage.
According to the note that was left with it, <cf>it was borrowed from someone by my dead father.
Even though it was a long time ago, he couldn't have just left it there.
So, I want you to find out who he borrowed it from.
It said, 'Borrowed from Ma. <cf>Maybe it's a nickname for the other person.
It's an easygoing vibe, and <cf>I think it's one of the residents of Salamzert.
I'd say he's a contemporary of my dad's. ......<cf>Mr. Samuel, or
She's a grandmother who knows things. <cf>Maybe the name 'Ma' rings a bell.
Well, then, please do me a favor.
Ask Mr. Samuels about this <cf>person called "Ma".
I think it's the person to whom my father owed his inheritance. <cf>I'm not sure who you're talking about, since I don't know who you're talking about.
Oh, hello there. Mr. Adventurer. <cf> What's the matter?
Oh, hi. Mr. Vail asked me to <cf>talk to you about the old days?
Yes, yes. <cf> I knew your father, Mr. Vail.
He was a serious, disciplined man. <cf>We used to play together when we were kids.
We would see the stalls and go out into the desert for a bit......
I even <cf>almost got attacked by a monster outside of town once. That scared the crap out of me.
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry. <cf>I was just telling you an old story.
I don't remember lending you anything. <cf>...... you left a note saying 'on loan from Ma'?
Mar ...... Mar. Oh!　<cf>Mr. Manfredo called you that.
Oh, and I remember being <cf>friendly</cf> with Mr. Vail's father.
It's easy to forget what happened recently, but <cf>I remember the old days well!
You should pay Mr. Manfredo a visit.
Mr. Manfredo used to call me 'Ma'.
He lives in Salamzert, <cf>you should visit him.
Huh?　Do I owe Mr. Vail's father anything?
I'm afraid I don't remember. ......
...... No, I don't. <cf>I guess you could say that!
My dad said that he still owes <cf> ["]Buffalia's inheritance to Mr. Vail's place ["]<cf> ["]Buffalia's inheritance.
My dad's name was Marty. <cf>He liked to collect odd things.
The nickname 'Ma' was probably my dad.
My dad had already passed away. <cf>I'd forgotten all about it.
I don't know what it's like, but <cf>If I could have it back, I would.
Tell Mr. Vail.
By "borrowed from Ma," <cf>I'm guessing it's a Buffalo legacy that my dad loaned him.
If you can get it back, I'd appreciate it. <cf>Please tell Mr. Vail.
Hello, adventurer. <cf>What did you find out about "Borrowed from Mar"?
...... I see. <cf>It was about Mr. Manfredo's dad, wasn't it?
Sure. I'd like to pay him back right away.
Apparently, the estate won't budge. <cf>I've been neglecting it for so long that it seems to have malfunctioned.
I looked into it, and it looks like I can adjust it with some <cf>'high-pressure liquid tubing' from <value type="enemyName" id="E003_05_00_02001"/>.
You can get it <cf>from <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>.
I'm sorry you had to borrow it for so long and broke it. <cf>It's only reasonable that we fix it up properly and give it back to you.
I'm sorry, but could you please go to "<value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>" and bring <cf>"high-pressure liquid pipe"?
Get me a <cf>'high-pressure liquid pipe' to repair the Buffalia legacy.
It should be taken from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E003_05_00_02001"/> at "<value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>". Please do.
Oh, thanks! <cf>You brought me a "high-pressure liquid tube".
Which, let's get on with fixing our heritage!
.............................. ......
...... Yeah, it seems to be working now. <cf> Good, good.
Can you give this back to Mr. Manfredo? <cf>Please tell her I'm sorry I left it on loan for so long.
I want you to go give Mr. Manfredo his inheritance back.
I'm sorry I've been borrowing it for so long. <cf>I would appreciate it if you could tell him that.
Oh, you <cf> received the Buffalo legacy from Mr. Vail?
Hm. Yes, he did return it to me. <cf>Thanks for your help.
So this is the Bafaria inheritance that my father lent you. <cf>I wonder what it's all about?
'...... za, then ......, then ......, then ......, then ......, then .......'
Dad ......?　I can hear my dad's voice now.
Apparently, this legacy is one that can <cf>record</cf> spoken voices.
No, I miss it. I miss it. <cf>I'm not sure what you're talking about. ......
'...... fredo ...... be well ......'
Now, the eagle's name is ......
...... years before his father died, <cf>I had a bit of a falling out with him.
We barely spoke to each other. ......
Still, I think he <cf>maybe</cf> he cared about me.
It's honestly nice to hear your voice.
Thanks a lot. <cf> You did what you asked me to do.
Hopefully someday I'll <cf>know</cf> what my dad was talking about.
Hey, it's you. <cf>You made Mr. Manfredo happy.
Just hearing your late dad's voice makes me feel <cf> nostalgic and strange, you know?
I can no longer hear my father's voice. <cf>A little, I envy that man.
It's like the ocean, like the sky. ...... <cf>My heart that stretches as far as it can go: ......
Oh, it's about to overflow! <cf>I wonder how big love can get!
<cf>There is no other happiness like this, to be able to see my guesses on stage!　You know what I mean!
Hah ...... einar. <cf>What a guilty man he is......?
In the previous two plays, he played a priest who was straight-forward in his work and <cf>was in forbidden love with a girl who came to him for [repentance], but in the last play, he lost his feelings.
On the previous stage, he was a young man who had lost his emotions and did not know love, <cf>telling us with pure eyes alone. ......
Do you think <cf>any audience can stand such a gap?
Yes, this is a sin!　If the world doesn't judge him, <cf>it's nothing but a blunder of this world!
...... Hmph, I'm talking out of my ass!
Einar is a promising young actor of the moment. <cf>I hope you got a glimpse of how dangerous he is!
And ...... I know how much I want your autograph.
I know!　I should be asking for these things myself! <cf>You should just look him straight in the eye and ask him for a word!
["]Einar-sama, please sign my autograph..."]. <cf> Straight ...... yes, straight ......
.................. muri......... .........
I can't do it!　I can't do it in person, of course I can't do it in person! <cf>I'll die on the spot if you do that!
So please...<cf>Give me your autograph for me! <cf>Get it signed for me!
Please address it to "Dear Sabrina"!
<cf>Get an autograph from the actor Einar!
I'll wait here. <cf> My legs are shaking so hard when I think of Einar.
Ugh...... I still can't do it. I can't! <cf>Can I really play this role?
...... Eh? <cf>Oh, I'm the actor Einar. ......
You want my autograph?
...... Sorry, I can't sign it right now. I can't sign right now. <cf>My hands are a little shaky.
It's a big show, <cf>I can't get over my nerves.
What if I forget my lines on stage?　What if the music stops? <cf>What if the stage sets fall over?　What if my dad is in the audience?
No. ......! <cf>I don't think I can keep my composure!
What on earth should I do? ...... ...... Yes, I know. <cf>Would you go get me the ingredients for cocoa?
Sweet cocoa does wonders to calm me down.
I've been holding back because I can't keep relying on it, but <cf>I can't make it to the stage this time without it!
Bring me the "Honey Cocoa Nuts"! <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>" should be able to collect them.
Bring me <cf>'Honey Cocoa Nuts' which can be collected at '<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>'!
Cocoa is all you need. <cf>I'll write as many signatures as you want!
Ah, "Honey Cocoa Nuts"! <cf>Thank you for bringing it!
I'll brew it right up! <cf>Since you're here. I'll get you one too.
...... Wind. Ah, good sweetness. <cf>That's soothing. ......
<cf>Okay, I'm starting to feel better. <cf>My head's starting to clear, too.
Oh no, I've shown you the embarrassing part.
I have a sweet tooth. <cf>I've been drinking this cocoa in particular for ages.
But I'm marketed as a cool role model, and <cf>liking cocoa doesn't really fit the image, does it?
That's one of the reasons I've been trying to cut back lately.
Anyway, you've been a big help. <cf>Yeah. Do I need your signature?
Sure, I'll write to thank you. <cf>I'll put your address on it, too.
Here you go. <cf>Deliver it to the client's admirer.
Sabrina, right? <cf>You can deliver my autograph to her.
<cf> I'd be happy to see you onstage, too, if you'd like.
C'mon! <cf>This, this is real, right?　Einar's autograph!
Haha ...... I'm so happy. <cf>I'm so touched. <cf>Thank you!
But you, you smell kind of sweet, don't you? <cf> Like cocoa......
No way, ......! <cf>Cocoa with einar......?
Yes, I did ask him to sign it! <cf>But you didn't ask me to have tea with you!
I hate you!　I hate you!　It's infuriating! <cf>I'm really jealous, to be more frank!
What did you talk about at ......?
...... does Einar drink sweet cocoa before a performance? <cf> That cool, clear-eyed Einar?
Lies, no such ......! <cf>No such ...... thing ......
<span size="Big">What a beautiful ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! </>
How can he be so cool and yet love sweet cocoa? <cf>How many faces does he have!
I can't look directly at him on the next stage anymore ....... <cf>I'll be an Imagine if I see him: ......
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about this. <cf>No, I can't tell!
<cf>When the fans find out about this, <cf>they will all go straight to the Gods of Buffalia!
It's a secret between me and Einar. ...... <cf>No way!　Too good to be true?　[Too good to die?
I want to say ...... I want to talk ....... <cf>I want to talk about Einar's secrets with my comrades: ......
But I can't talk about it all the time to protect everyone. <cf>This is an ordeal brought on by Einar. ......
Ya-moo! <cf>You're not at home, ahkita!
Why do I have to stay home alone? <cf>This is no fun at all!
My father is a painter.
He's in Litze right now, and he's crazy about painting.
He's forgotten about me anyway!
I've been praying to the Gods of Buffalia for him to be well, but he never comes back.
I complain to him that he never comes back, and he sneaks out in the morning.
I complained to him, and he would sneak out in the morning!
I can't forgive him for caring more about his paintings than me! <cf>Tell him to come home and play with me!
What's your father's name? <cf>Tregano!　<cf> Tregano the painter!
<cf>Your father is in Litze, you know. <cf>You must let me come home!
Your father's name is Tregano. <cf>He paints in Litze.
<cf>I'm not going to stay home alone, that's boring! <cf>Tell him to come home!
<cf> You are an adventurer, aren't you? <cf>Are you also fascinated by the landscape of Litze?
I am a painter, my name is Tregano.
<cf>I came all the way from Salamzat because I heard that the mountains seen from this village are truly magnificent!
Well, the view is even better than it sounds! <cf> I can't stop creating!
......What? <cf>I've been asked to come back from Loubell?
You want me to come home? <cf>Are you saying that your paintings are more important than your daughter?
Ugh, Rowbell said that ......
If I finish the painting I'm working on now, <cf>I'll be on my way home right away!　But ......
Unfortunately, I'm out of white paint. <cf>I'm having new ones made!
I'm asking Mr. Detlef, the artisan, to do it for me. <cf>But it's late for Mr. Detlef.
I told him I would wait patiently. ......
I understand. <cf>I'll leave as soon as I finish this painting.
Could you please go to Mr. Detlef and <cf>pick up the paints.
Could you please go to Mr. Detlef and <cf> receive the white paints?
He is a paint maker in Litze. <cf> I'll keep working on a few paintings.
Oh, come on in. You want to order some paints? <cf> I'm Detlef, the paint-maker, man.
Oh, oh, you're ordering Tregano. <cf>White paint. Sorry you had to come all the way out here.
Actually, I ran out of the stuff, so I can't make it.
I make more than just white paint. <cf>The mineral engram gives it a special coloring.
I use a stone called "polarized stone. <cf>The light is deflected, allowing for a perfect fill.
But then the mooks started hanging around the diggings.
Do you need it urgently? <cf> Then why don't you do me a favor?
Go to the Great Litze Cavern and get me some polarized stone.
With that, I can make paints in no time. <cf>Thank you for your time and effort, but please do me a favor.
If you deliver it to me, <cf>I can make the paints right away. I'll take care of it for you.
Oh, "Polarized stone. <cf>Thank you for collecting it.
I've already finished the other concoctions. <cf>Finally, I'll crush this one and mix it ......
Yup, that's it!　The white paint you wanted. There you go.
By the way, why did you, an adventurer, come to <cf>pick up paints?
......?　Bastard Tregano. <cf>Have you been neglecting your daughter?
This is no time for painting!
<cf>Tell Tregano. <cf>I'll sell you the paints like I promised.
<cf>In exchange, <cf>you will return to your daughter with the paints in your hands!　I'll tell you what...
If you can't do that, I'll never sell you paints again!
Tregano is still in Litze, isn't he? <cf>Deliver the white paints to him.
And when you receive it, get the hell home! <cf>Tell him that.
Oh!　You <cf> brought Mr. Detlef's paints for me!
Thank you. Now you can finish your painting.
Hmm ......?　Mr. Detlef wants you to ["]go home right away["]? <cf> Or I'll never sell you paints again!
Ugh. How harsh. ......
No, but Mr. Detlef is right. <cf>It wasn't right to leave my daughter alone.
Understood. <cf> I'll draw up the rest of the story when I get back to Salamzaat.
You are going to report to Loubell too, right? <cf>May I follow along with you?
Ah!　You're home at last, father!
Rowbel. I'm sorry. <cf>It's getting all late.
Don't paint anymore. You should stay home all the time.
Oh, well, thanks for that. <cf> It's my job, and I like it.
Then you can paint my paintings.
<cf>You don't paint landscapes, Dad.
I'm a painter, okay?
...... This one's got a point. <cf>You're right. I'll get right on it.
Adventurer. <cf>Sorry for the inconvenience.
I get carried away when it comes to painting. <cf>That's not good of me.
I'll pay you for it. <cf>The client is my daughter, but I should be able to make up for that.
Thanks to you, my dad is back! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
Dad, he paints pictures of me.
He takes me all over the place, and <cf>when I stay still, he paints.
The only problem is that if I fall asleep in the middle of the painting, <cf>I in the painting fall asleep too!
Oh, God!　Why can't my father and mother forgive me?
I have a dream, too. <cf>I want to be an actress and perform on the big stage!
But my father and mother are against it. <cf>No matter how hard I tried to convince them, they wouldn't let me.
But you know what? The other day, my father finally said, <cf>"I'm going to give you a challenge, and I want you to do it.
If I accomplish it, he'll give me his approval!
But it's a very difficult task, and I don't think I can do it by myself.
So I decided to hire an adventurer. <cf><cf><em><em>I</em><em>was</em><em>not</em><cf> told me not to hire one!
The challenge was to get the precious stones found in the desert.
Two "Sandflowers" and one <cf>"Leafstone".
Let's start with the "Sand Flower" first. <cf>"I heard they can be found at the Hermit's Fountain.
Well then, let's go to the Hermit's Fountain!
There it is! <cf>The Sandflower!
<cf>The Sand Flower is a stone that was worn by the diva at the Seiryoku Festival long ago.
It was so beautiful that it stayed in everyone's hearts.
Since then, it's been famous as a <cf> good luck charm for girls who are trying to achieve something.
<cf>It looks like just a stone as it is, but if you polish it patiently, it turns into a beautiful pink color.
There is one more thing, <cf>"Sandflower" should be in the "Khartoum Ruins".
Let's look for it.
There it is, I found it! <cf> The Sandflower!
Now we have two Sandflowers. <cf> Now we just need to find the Leafstone.
Where is the "Leaf Stone" ......?
Oh, I remember now!　It can be found in the belly of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>.
......, my father! <cf>How dare you ask me to get something like that?
I can't fight <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>!
I'm sorry, adventurer. Could you go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/> and get some <cf>"reefstone"?
It would slow me down, and <cf>I'll go back to Salamzaat first.
In the meantime, I'll polish up the sandflowers.
<cf>The Sandflowers and the Leafstone need to be polished by human hands to shine.
It takes a lot of patience, but I'm confident in that.
Leave the polishing to me. <cf>Adventurers, please take care of the leaf stones!
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>You found the "Leafstone" for me.
Thank you very much. <cf>I'll polish it up right away and show it to Father.
Wait for me, Father! <cf>I won't let you complain about this!
[--]I'm home! <cf>Hey, adventurer, will you listen to me!
Father, you're such a tease! <cf>Here's what he says.
["]I knew you couldn't do it alone, but <cf>you thought of hiring an adventurer["]!
["]You did well this time. <cf>But this is only the first trial! ["]]
["]After you get through the second and third trials, I <cf>may</cf> consider it! []][cf][cf][cf][cf][cf]I'll think about it!
What would you do if I were directly fighting <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>?　I asked ......
[I've raised her to at least <cf>judge whether she can fight or not["].
Does he believe in his daughter or not? <cf>Which is it?
If she's so opposed to me, maybe I should run away from home? <cf>I sometimes wondered that. ......
I <cf>want my family to bless my dream!
<cf>So, I'll do my best! <cf>I'm going to make sure they approve of me becoming an actress!
<cf>Thank you so much for your help this time. <cf>Please help me achieve my dream again!
<cf>My father and mother are still not going to allow me to become an actress.
But I feel <cf>they might look at me a little differently now that I've completed this assignment.
I'm never going to give up, you know!
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>There's been a strange incident at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>. <cf>I've instructed my men to investigate ......
<cf>They have not been very successful. <cf>They have been out of touch.
I'm not the kind of guy who throws his work away. <cf>It's worrisome. ......
He seems concerned. <cf><value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>I'll let you know if I notice anything.
Someone's baggage is down.
The bag has the emblem of the pioneer station painted on it. <cf>It looks like equipment for outdoor activities.
I'll go to the pioneer bureau and deliver it to the bureau staff.
...... hmm?　You. <cf> Sorry to be so blunt.
That bag ....... <cf>Maybe you picked it up at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>?
...... I knew it! <cf>It belonged to my man, Cecil.
She went to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/> on a mission. <cf>Only her luggage was left behind. ......
You, I'm sorry to repeat myself. <cf>Could you take care of my request?
Thank you. <cf>Let me explain the situation.
I am currently investigating a case.
<cf> Recently, I've observed that in various parts of the Asteria Plain, cemeteries have been vandalized by someone or something.
Was it by monsters or by human hands? <cf>We are investigating that as well.
I've dispatched my man Cecil to investigate the situation, but <cf>there's something fishy going on.
That's why I asked for your help.
Cecile is a young man with a lot to offer. <cf>I decided that if we left it in her hands, there would be no problem.
But when I heard about the grave robbers, <cf>I couldn't help but notice that she seemed somewhat preoccupied.
And there it is, the backpack you found for me.
I have a bad feeling about this. ...... <cf>Sorry, but I need you to find her first.
Cecile should have headed to the "garrison" in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>. <cf>I want you to go check on her.
<cf>I've ordered my man Cecil to investigate a series of grave robberies.
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>, he should be headed for the "garrison" of <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>. <cf>I want you to check on her.
Yes, I am. I'm looking into grave robbing<cf>Cecil is me.
...... Sisto asked you to <cf>see how I'm doing?
Thank you for that. <cf>Mr. Sisto, you were worried.
I can't fight, but <cf>I ran out in a hurry. ......
Sorry for the trouble I caused you.
I did some research on the grave robbers. <cf>The culprits were a swarm led by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>.
We do not know the reason or purpose for raiding the tombs. <cf>The goblins have not been confirmed to have such an ecology,......
...... Actually, my grandmother's grave was also <cf>robbed by goblins!
When I went to visit her grave, I found that her grave marker had fallen down. <cf>The ground was also dug up!
When I heard Sisto's story, I couldn't <cf>stand still</cf>. ......
So I came all the way here.
Adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/> Can you help me defeat him?
He's lurking in a nasty place ....... <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>" should find him.
Once the herd is defiled, the tombs will no longer be disturbed. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>Please defeat them!
<cf><value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>Please take down <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>!
Then the herd will disperse and the damage from the <cf>grave robbers will be contained!
Thank you for defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>!
The herd seems to have scattered. <cf>Now they will no longer raid your graves!
Grandma will surely rest in peace!
Speaking of which, while the adventurers were fighting, <cf>I was checking out the area around the razed cemetery: ......
Some of the goblin corpses had marks on them as if <cf>they had been impaled on something.
It appears that they were poked quite violently and repeatedly. The size of the <cf>scar was about the size of a <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/> staff.
Is this also the work of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/> ......
It's kind of a little creepy. <cf> I'll have to report this to Mr. Sisto.
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>Could you please come with me to Mr. Sisto?
You are safe, Cecil. <cf>First of all, let's be happy about that.
And you, too. <cf>Thanks for the request on such short notice.
Now then, let's hear your report on the grave robbers. <cf>What the hell happened, Cecil?
Actually, ............
...... I see. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>and the herd raided the tombs.
And the herd was destroyed by you. <cf>I thank you again and again. You saved my life.
Cecil. I understand how it happened. <cf>I would like you to be very careful from now on.
<cf>Your grandmother has asked me not to hurt you.
Ah ....... Yes, I understand. <cf>Sorry, Sisto.
And I'm curious about <cf>the strange marks left on the goblin's corpse.
It looks like something was violently impaled on the mark. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/> like a cane ......
Right. <cf>This is just a hypothesis: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/> may have been performing <cf>some ritual by piercing the corpse
Goblin culture and thought is a mystery, and we cannot speak with <cf>confidence</cf>.
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/> are highly intelligent monsters. <cf>It must have been one of the most unique individuals with unique values.
It may have raided the tombs in search of <cf>bodies to make holes in.
It's hard to verify, but I'll record it for your information. <cf>Thanks for your efforts, Cecil.
Yes, I <cf>did</cf> have a good time. Thank you.
You've been a great help to me. <cf>That's valuable information. I appreciate it.
Individual differences in monsters are not uncommon. <cf> Sometimes they can be a factor in derailing the predictions of pioneering bureaus.
We will continue to investigate. <cf>We need your help again.
Cecil's on his way to restore the vandalized cemetery.
He looked radiant. <cf>It seems to have regained its original brightness.
Thanks to you. Thank you.
We <cf>do</cf> offer tea and coffee in our store.
We have some precious brands from foreign countries, too. <cf>Please enjoy it!
Thank you for accepting. <cf>Actually, you forgot something.
<cf>We should be the ones to deliver it, but we're busy and can't take our hands off it.
Please deliver this handkerchief.
The one who forgot it is a regular customer, Miss Catherine.
She was enjoying a tea party in our store with three of her friends' daughters.
She is the daughter of a well-known merchant family in Asterlys. <cf>I believe she is probably at home.
Please give her my best regards.
Please deliver the handkerchief to Miss Catherine, the lady of Astérlys.
We are busy ....... <cf> I'm sorry, but we'd be grateful for your help.
Oh, how do you do? <cf>What can an adventurer do for you?
...... the handkerchief you left in the store? <cf>I have a handkerchief?
...... This is not mine!
This simple design is Madeline's. <cf>Where did they switch?
Oh, by the way, at the tea party, <cf>I told you about my fiancé who gave me the handkerchief.
I must have misplaced it then.
<cf>Thank you for the delivery. <cf>And you.
Would you please return this replaced handkerchief to <cf>Madeline</cf>?
Madeline should be by the entrance to the theater on the way to the Temple of Buffalia.
She is a vocalist. <cf>She has a voice that is well known in Asterlys.
Would you bring Madeline a handkerchief?
She should be by the entrance to the theater on the way to the Temple of Buffalia.
Oh, my dear adventurer. <Are you going to the opera?
What, to deliver me a handkerchief to ......? <cf> No, I have my own.
...... Oh?　This is not mine.
I must have gotten it wrong somewhere. <cf>I'm so embarrassed.
This one you brought is mine, isn't it? <cf>Well, Catherine brought it to ......
Then you must have taken the wrong one at the tea party.
So this one I was holding belonged to <cf>Claudia?
The gold thread embroidery and the scent of this perfume residue ....... <cf>I'm sure of it.
Catherine, Claudia and I. <cf>Because the three of us were having a tea party at the cafe.
I'm sorry for the frequent interruptions. <cf>Could you please deliver this to Claudia?
She has just left for Salamzert.
I have a rehearsal for the opera. <cf>I am very sorry to trouble you.
<cf>I would be grateful for your kind attention.
Please deliver the handkerchief to <cf>Claudia</cf> in Salamzert.
I have a rehearsal for an opera. <cf>Please take care of me.
Good day, adventurer. <cf> Can I help you?
Well, the handkerchief you misplaced? <cf> You took the trouble to deliver it here.
Thank you very much. It's very helpful.
But ...... it's strange. <cf>I would have left my handkerchief here ......
Oh ......?　Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It doesn't belong to me. <cf>I looked closely and saw the name of the store on it.
<cf>Well, well, well, well. <cf>I think I brought you a napkin from the store.
<cf>I'm pretty sure that what you delivered is <cf>my handkerchief.
It was hand-stitched by my mother. <cf>Thank you so much.
Yes, it is. <cf>You are going back to the store, aren't you?
Could I please have this napkin back? <cf>I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
<cf>Please return this napkin to Paula's store in Asterlys.
<cf>I'm sorry to have inconvenienced you.
I see that you were able to deliver the handkerchief to Lady Catherine. <cf>Thank you.
Oh?　Isn't that ......<cf> the napkin from this store?
I was looking for it earlier. <cf>Why do you have it?
......Hmmmmm. I see. <cf>I see that you have met all three of the people at the tea party.
No wonder you look so tired.
No, I am sorry. <cf>I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you.
But all three of you have the wrong handkerchiefs, and <cf>Mrs. Claudia brought a napkin from the store.
<cf>Miss Claudia is a first-rate violinist. <cf>I'm sure her playing is among the best in the world.
But she is not good at anything else.
Catherine and Madeline are also very similar. <cf>So it was a careless tea party.
I apologize for all the trouble I have caused you. <cf>Please take your time and visit us this time.
<cf>Since the incident with the handkerchief, all the staff members have been paying attention to make sure we haven't forgotten anything.
After all, this is a cafe where careless people gather.
Calligraphy is an art. <cf>It's not just about writing letters.
It is more than just writing letters. The feelings. The heart. <cf>These are expressed in the letters as a whole.
<cf>The destination of the brush shows the way. <cf> In other words, it is the spirit of calligraphy.
I am a calligrapher. <cf>It is not very popular in this city yet.
Calligraphy is not about good or bad handwriting. <cf>It's about the heart and emotion that you put into it.
In other words, calligraphy is ...... Sorry. <cf>I had to talk about your request.
Actually. <cf>I am old and looking for a successor.
And my granddaughter, Lindsay, has offered to take over for me.
Of course, I am grateful. But ......
I was wondering if she might be taking things too far out of her way to take care of me.
Does Lindsay really want to live as a calligrapher? <cf>I want to know her true feelings.
So I wrote a letter to her. <cf>Will you deliver this and go talk to her?
And if Lindsay has a problem, <cf>could you help her solve it?
<cf>I know that there are things that are difficult for you to talk about in my presence. <cf>Therefore, I ask you.
<cf>Take the letter to Lindsay and ask her to listen to what I have to say. <cf>Please do this for me.
<cf>Please deliver a letter to my granddaughter, Lindsay, and listen to what she has to say.
She runs an agency in Asterlys. <cf>She works hard and I'm proud of her.
Oh, you got a letter from Grandpa for me?
Wow, thank you. <cf>It's exciting to get a letter, isn't it?
Let's see... ...... <cf>Hey, your handwriting is as beautiful as ever!
My grandpa is a calligrapher. <cf>Hmmmmm, I see. About the successor, I see.
You're so clumsy, grandpa. <cf>You should have asked him directly.
Don't worry. <cf>I really mean it when I say I want to be a calligrapher.
A heartfelt calligraphy moves the hearts of those who see it. <cf>I learned that from Grandpa Baphit.
<cf>I run a substitute calligrapher business because I want to send something to the hearts of the people who read my letters.
So, you know. <cf>I wanted to let people know more about calligraphy.
I made these posters!　What do you think?
Signs, posters, flyers<cf> I'll write whatever cool letters you want!　Lindsay
If you want to write letters on a signboard or a poster, you can do it!　If you write letters on a store sign or poster, a lot of people will see them, won't they?
If it's cool or beautiful, <cf>people might understand how great calligraphy is!
If you want, you can help us put up the posters.
On a pillar in the shopping street, or in front of a pioneering bureau. <cf>The entrance to Asterlys would also stand out.
I'd like you to find a place like that and <cf>put up the posters.
Thank you! <cf>Come back when you're done putting them all up.
<cf>Please put up the posters in prominent places in the city.
In the shopping arcade, in front of the Pioneer Bureau, etc. <cf>And I think the town gate square would be good too.
I put up the posters Lindsay gave me.
A passerby seemed interested. <cf>["]I wonder what kind of writing he's going to do["]</cf>"], he said.
An adventurer seems interested. <cf>[ "]Maybe we can write it on the team's banner ["]"].
Finished putting up all the posters.
Oh?　What's this poster. <cf>"I'll write whatever cool letters you want!" ......?
Heh, doesn't that sound interesting? <cf>Anta, come talk to me for a minute.
I'm Lysander. I'm the world's fastest horseman!
My carriage is fast, but <cf>it's not fast enough to be cool.
I thought it would be cool to put a flag on it, <cf>to give it a sense of speed.
But I ain't got the artistic ability, and I can't write. <cf> So, a white flag?　That's not cool.
And that's where your poster comes in!
Someone who can write anything cool? <cf>That's great!
Can you take me to him?
<cf>Take me to the guy who writes all kinds of cool stuff.
Lindsay-chan, you say? <cf> Okay, let's go!
Ah, adventurer. Welcome back! <cf> You've been putting up posters.
That's something. <cf>It looks like Grandpa came too, after all.
Thanks for delivering the letter. <cf>You did your grandson a favor.
I found Lindsay's name on the poster you had and <cf>was curious enough to come.
I told you I'm fine with the succession. <cf>...... that?　Adventurer, who's that over there?
Oh, I'm Lysander!
<cf>Are you the one who writes everything cool?　I have a favor to ask you.
Oh!　You've got a visitor right off the bat.
What do you want to start with, Lindsay?
<cf> I'm going to write some cool stuff on posters, billboards, and flyers to show people how great calligraphy can be.
I've always wanted to do that. <cf>Because your grandfather's calligraphy is amazing!
I don't know what calligraphy is, though. <cf>Can grandpa write cool letters too?
Yes, he does. <cf>Your handwriting is very beautiful and cool!
That's great! <cf>Then you can write with me, Grandpa!
What I want is a flag to put on the carriage! <cf>I want a really cool one!
I'll go around bragging about it to all the passengers I give rides to! <cf>["]Have you ever seen such cool writing? [I'll show it off to all my passengers!
That way they'll know what calligraphy is all about!
......I know what I'm talking about. I'll definitely give it a try. <cf>I never thought this day would come.
I did it!　I'll take care of it, Mr. Lysander. <cf>We'll write the coolest letters together!
You are the adventurer. Lindsay and I are both indebted to you. <cf>I am truly sorry.
Knowing my grandson's heart, I too was lit up. <cf>I will write this Baphit with all my heart and soul.
<cf>I have been able to do a great job, which is rare in my long life. <cf>Most of all, I learned Lindsay's true heart.
All thanks to you. <cf>Thank you!
It's been a long time since I've been back home ....... <cf>This great detective's nose can smell a case!
Cases are great, but <cf>would you like to visit the mansion?　Sir.
You have come to the right place, my assistant!
Together with me, the great detective Guido, let's <cf> solve the mystery of the "Night Cart Attack" case!
Sorry for the inconvenience, adventurer.
Assistant or not, <cf>pretending to be a detective, please join me, sir!
The client of this case is <cf> a certain big businessman.
A wagon was driving down a street at night when <cf>suddenly it was attacked by someone. ......
<cf>The master is a stone-cold fool when he's dealing with thugs. <cf>Please protect him!
Hahaha! <cf>I will not be defeated by some thug!
<cf>I may look like this, but I used to win all the prizes in the children's tournament at the Asterlys arena!
<cf>All things are going to be as they should be. <cf>We have to ask our adventurers to do the heavy lifting.
Now, let the investigation begin! <cf>First, let's hear a detailed story from the victim of the incident.
A lady by the name of Catherine. <cf>She lives in Asterlys. Here we come!
Lady Catherine ....... <cf>We have the same name, but that's just a coincidence. ......
You are the client, Lady Catherine! <cf>The great detective Guido is here to talk to you!
Oh, please wait! <cf>Madame Catherine was really the client!
Hohohoho!　We meet in unexpected places, don't we? <cf>Haven't seen you in two years, Cindy?
Gosh, it's been a while. ......
Oh, you two know each other?
...... Are you serious? <cf>No way, did you forget about me?
No, no, I don't think so! <cf>You are right, aren't you, sir?
Huh?　I don't know what you're talking about.
And anyway, about the incident! <cf>Can you describe the culprit who attacked the wagons?
......Well, good sir. <cf>I'll tell you my personal story later.
Please listen to me, adventurers. <cf>Actually, it was too dark to see the attacker.
<cf> But he is a man of great strength. <cf>The whole wagon was pushed over!
Well, a whole wagon. ...... <cf>That must have been a terrible experience.
<cf>I'm more angry than horrified at the moment, though, aren't I?
Anyway, I'm at your service. <cf>Let's see how good a detective you are, shall we?
For some reason, the client seems to be glaring at me ....... <cf> Did I do something rude?
Anyway, the next part of the investigation is about the streets at night. <cf>I'll try to get the officials to talk to you.
I will leave it to you to interview the people in town. <cf>When you gather information, please let me know.
<cf>I will talk to the townspeople about the incidents that occurred on the street
If you are a peddler or adventurer, you must use the city streets often. <cf>I have a feeling you have information!
You say your wagon was attacked on the street at night?
If that's the story, I'd have an idea. <cf>I've been in a similar situation myself.
I was driving the wagon and <cf>suddenly a big shadow appeared in front of me!
We almost collided.
I think it was much bigger than a human being. <cf>I'm sorry, but I was so startled that I ran away. ......
I don't really know what it was. Sorry.
A wagon was attacked on the street at night?
Hmmm ....... I don't know if this has anything to do with the story, but <cf>I had a strange experience.
I once came across a <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/> who stood in front of a group of people on a street at night!
Of course, I went in to help. I thought <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/> was attacking me.
But then <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/>they and the humans ran away!
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/> but why did <cf>even those people run away?
After all, no one stayed there, so <cf>we'll never know what happened.
So, sir. <cf>You should show your face at the mansion once in a while: ......
Hahaha!　I'm busy too. <cf>I don't have time to go back to the mansion.
You haven't been back for two years after saying that! <cf>That's why you've been so busy with Catherine.
Oh, my assistant. Welcome back. <cf>Have you gathered any information about the night streets?
Let's hear what you have to say as soon as possible!
Oh, this might be a dead end: ......
Oh, I see. ...... <cf>A shadow larger than a man, a strange group and <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/>......
Hmph. <cf>I've solved the mystery of this case!
The culprit is, as we all know, the legendary demi-god sealed away in ancient times[--]!
That seems to have something to do with what we <cf>heard</cf> about the bandits.
Recently, the bandits hiding in <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/> have joined forces with <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/>.
Maybe the plan is to have <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_01001"/> attack the wagons and <cf>the bandits will take the cargo!
......................... <cf>Good point, Cindy!
It is outrageous that humans and <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/> are teaming up! They are a terrible threat to <cf>Asterlys!
You must go and defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/> as soon as possible. <cf>I'll figure out how to deal with the bandits.
Once <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/> is gone, <cf>the bandits will have nothing left to do!
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/>Take them down, I ask you!
Um, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Will you let me know when you are done defeating them?
Perhaps the Master will <cf>not be able to do that anymore. ......
Please go to <value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/> and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/>!
Leave the bandits alone, they are fine. Once you have defeated <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/>, there is nothing more you can do!
Please let me know when you are done defeating them. <cf>Thank you!
Ah, you have defeated <value type="enemyName" id="E001_00_00_00_01001"/>, have you not? <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
As for the bandits, you have strengthened your patrols. <cf>I think we should be good to go now.
And as for your husband, well, you know, ....... <cf>I've been a bit occupied.
You seriously don't realize!　Guido!
I'm your fiancée, Catherine!
Oh my!　You are my darling Catherine!
Ha ha ha!　You look so different. <cf> You have become a fine lady!
You, silly! <cf> You should have noticed this at the request stage!
How could you think of forgetting your fiancée's face! <cf>Please say a word to her, adventurer-sama!
As you can see, the two of you are engaged to be married!
And yet you have not seen each other for two years. <cf>Because of the Master's not returning to the mansion, ......
Catherine is furious that he has not heard from her and has even forgotten her face.
I asked for you because I heard your name, but you didn't even <cf>remember</cf>!
What do you mean? <cf>I remembered your name too!
If you forget that much, we'll call off the engagement!
...... This will not stop for the time being. <cf>Mr. Adventurer. Here is your reward.
Please take it back before you get involved. <cf>Thank you so much for your cooperation!
Now, I wonder what the next case will be! <cf>A mystery is calling me!
<cf>It is I who am calling you! <cf>Turn around, Guido!
Sir, I beg of you, please apologize! <cf>Because that will all be settled!
Welcome to the "Great Bookshelf of the Rectors". <cf>We also lend out books here!
I ask that you return them on time, please.
Some books are hard to come back!
<cf>Some books can be checked out from the Rector's Big Bookcase.
We ask that you return the books by the due date, but <cf>sometimes there are books that are not returned.
This is one of them. <cf>Please tell them to return the books as soon as possible.
The book is lent to a boy named Yuska.
The title of the book is "Keon Boken Roku" ("Keon's Adventure Record"). <cf>I read it many times when I was a child.
It is an adventure novel in which the main character, the adventurer Keon, <cf>bravely and intelligently<cf>explores numerous ruins!
<cf>Keon is really cool and nice! <cf>My first love was also him ......!
Gohon, gohon! <cf>No, no, now!　Forget about it!
Well, you were talking about Yuska, weren't you?
He was a book lover and used to come here often. <cf>He never missed a due date.
He didn't seem to make friends, <cf>I was a little worried about that.
Could you help me find Mr. Yuska? <cf>I don't know where he is, so ......
Ask your classmates at school. <cf>I'm sure they can tell you where he is.
Ask your classmates <cf>where they are, Mr. Yuska.
I don't know where he plays other than here, but <cf>I'm sure he knows kids your age.
Yuska? <cf>Oh, you're the new student who recently joined us.
She reads all the time, so<cf>it's hard to talk to her.
He goes home right after school too. ...... <cf>I don't know where he hangs out.
Ah, but. <cf>The other day they were arguing.
You see that big bridge at the entrance to town? <cf>Are we going over that bridge or not?
Of course, kids aren't allowed to go there.
Yuska was very aggressive and said, "[I'll] go over there! [I'm going to go!" <cf> He was shouting so loud.
No, I think he was joking anyway. <cf>Because there are monsters on the other side of the bridge.
What's that Yuska guy thinking?
Yuska's guy said something like, "["]I'm going over the bridge["]<cf>.
It's not safe because there's going to be monsters, too. <cf> What's he thinking?
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Yes. Yuska is me, though.
...... Isial asked you to return the book? <cf>Oh, I completely forgot ......
It's "The Keon Adventure Book", isn't it? <cf>Yes, I have it here.
I read this story and got hooked. <cf>I thought adventurers were awesome and cool!
So I thought ...... I'd copy you and <cf>go to the ruins of Buffalia!
Not to cross the bridge alone, but ......
I thought if I could do that, everyone at school would <cf>recognize me a little better......
That's not going to happen. <cf>I came here and got a cold head.
I'm sorry. I, I'm leaving. <cf>I have to return the book and apologize to Mr. Isial.
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you take me back to the pioneer station?
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>You brought Yuska with you.
...... Eh! <cf>Yuska-kun, you went to the other side of the bridge all by yourself!
Why did you do that? <cf>It would be dangerous!
I'm sorry. <cf>But it was written in the "Keon Adventure Book.
<cf>"Being an adventurer is not a profession. <cf> Anyone with an adventurous spirit is an adventurer.
"And the qualities of an adventurer are not brawn or wisdom.
<cf> "And the quality of an adventurer is not brawn or wisdom, but a heart that believes in itself and draws out its own strength, which it does not even know it has. <cf> In other words, courage.
I wanted to prove that I have courage.
Yes, there is a passage like that. <cf> But, Yuska. Your actions are not proof of courage.
'Only the courageous admit failure.
'Let the bitter memories be engraved in our hearts, and let them be the steps we take tomorrow. <cf> We must not forget the courage to accept our mistakes.'
<cf> "Do not look back on your failures, and die like animals. <cf> It is one of the most foolish dishonors.
<cf> Is it the courage that Keon says to justify yourself while doing something that would cause someone else to worry?
Well, that's ......
You're not reading that right, boy.
Yeah ....... I was wrong. <cf>Sorry, Isial.
It's okay if you understand. <cf>Don't be reckless again.
Yuska, you are safe and your book has been returned. <cf>Thank you, adventurer.
I know very well that he is not a bad boy. <cf>I will watch over him more closely than ever.
I am glad I asked you, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>It's people like you that children look up to!
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for what you did for Yuska-kun.
Yuska-kun has been remorseful since then, too. <cf>It seems like you've made some friends just because you showed some guts.
He came to the archives a little less often, but <cf>I'm sure this was for the best.
Hmmm, it's still a beautiful stone no matter how many times I see it: ......
I knew my eyes were not mad. <cf>You, too, should choose well when buying jewelry.
Lately, around here, <cf>suddenly <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>has been showing up.
I've been trying to get rid of them, but <cf>they only show up when I'm looking at the fields.
This has never happened before. <cf>So, I need you to find out why.
First of all, can you <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> take down <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>?
We need to keep them away from the fields first. <cf>Thanks for your help.
<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>, and keep them away from my fields.
Oh, it's you! You killed <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>!
I appreciate that. <cf>But at the same time, there was a problem.
The gem I just bought the other day <cf>suddenly lost its light!
See, here it is. <cf>It's a beautiful red gem, and I've always admired it.
It was shining just a few moments ago. ......
...... wait. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> only appeared after I bought this gem!
And the gem lost its luster right after <cf>you defeated <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>......
Could it be that this gem has something to do with <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>?
Would you <cf>please go talk to the adventurer who sold this gem to me?
She is a female adventurer named Durga. <cf>She should be in this town, so please look for her.
Could you <cf>hunt down the female adventurer named Durga who sold me the red gem?
She should be somewhere in Salamzat. <cf>If she's an adventurer, she's probably near the pioneer station.
The red jewel that Mr. Manfredo has? <cf> Yeah, the one I sold him.
What?　<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> appeared or the light of the gem disappeared when <cf>you defeated it?
Did that happen? <cf>I found that jewel in the ruins.
I thought it was beautiful and priceless. <cf>Mr. Manfredo bought it for me.
...... Wait a minute. <cf>You said <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> suddenly started showing up?
I had some <cf>monster attacks a while ago too.
But I'm fine now. <cf>......Yes. It's been about the time I gave up that red gem.
Don't tell me that the red gem is <cf>attracting monsters?
If so, we're in trouble! <cf>This guy better look into it properly.
Maybe we can find some <cf>materials at the Asterlys Settlement Bureau.
I'll help too. <cf> Let's go to Asterlys.
Did you find anything on the red gem?
Oh, this book. Let's see. ......
"Once there was a jewel of five colors that was cursed.
"The red gem has the power to attract demons around the person who holds it.
"When the power of the curse is exerted, <cf> the gemstone shines brightly.
"When the curse is repelled, the jewel loses its luster.
But the power of the curse remains, and <cf> the jewel begins to shine again. ......
You said Mr. Manfredo's jewel stopped <cf> shining, right?
If that's this cursed jewel, <cf>it will shine again, won't it?
If that's the case, <cf>monsters might appear at Mr. Manfredo's place again!
This is not good! <cf>Let's go back to Salamzaat right away!
Oh!　That's you! <cf>And Durga's with you, isn't he?
Listen to me! <cf>The red gems are starting to shine again!
Overlapping it, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> also appeared!
I knew it! <cf>Mr. Manfredo. That thing is a cursed gem.
When it shines, it attracts monsters, <cf> and when you defeat it, it loses its luster.
But the power of the curse doesn't wear off, so when it glows again, the monsters will appear.
Hey, what a thing they sold me!
I didn't know! <cf>I'm sorry, that's why I'm here.
Anyway, first of all, <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>. <cf>We can't even talk to them until we get rid of them.
You know, "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>. <cf>Let's get this over with.
I'm sorry to keep coming back. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> of <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>, please go take them down.
But still, I never thought such a beautiful gem was <cf>cursed ......
You got rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>. <cf>We thank you for that. Thank you.
But the red gem has <cf>lost its luster again. ......
Hey, Mr. Manfredo. <cf>I'll give you your money back, but you'd better let go of that gem.
It's a jewel that will curse its owner.
I can't let anyone else have it either. <cf> How about having the Pioneer Bureau take care of it for me?
Ummm, but ....... <cf>It's not every day you find such a beautiful gem!
Is there any way to break the curse somehow?
There might be, but right now I don't know.
That's because the jewels are beautiful, though. <cf>Your life is more important, right?
Ummmmmmmmm ......
...... You guys are right. I can't help it. <cf>We'll let go of the jewelry, though it's a shame to leave it behind.
I'm the one who asked you to find out the cause of the problem. <cf> Well, thank you.
<cf> I will take the jewelry to the settlement office. <cf>Thank you for all the trouble you've gone through because of my mismanagement.
Thanks to you, I was able to stop the damage from the curse. <cf>I thank you too. Thank you.
Oh, you! <cf>Have you lifted the curse on the red gem?
Be the first to tell me when the curse is lifted. <cf> I'll buy it from you no matter how much it costs!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　It was my precious toy! <cf>I must get it back!
<cf>I'll buy it back for you. <cf>I'll buy it back for you, okay?
Hey, you're the adventurer, right? <cf>Help me out!
I was playing with a pineapple and another pineapple took <cf>me and my pineapple toy!
I'm sorry for suddenly coming to you, Adventurer. <cf>Hmph, you look like you have no idea what's going on!
Do you know a monster called <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>?
I say it looks like a pineapple, and it does. <cf>Two types are often seen: green and purple.
The green ones are cute and <cf>everyone likes them.
They do graffiti on walls and <cf>jump out of the shadows and startle people. ......
Just like my kids. <cf>My kid is friends with the green <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/> too.
That's right. We were playing together. <cf>And then he took my toy!
<cf>It's purple that's bad. <cf>Purple pineapple!
The purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/> is. <cf>Unlike the green ones, they're a little tougher.
They block the roads, make it impassable, <cf>destroy the vegetables in the fields,</cf> and ......
In the worst case, they can hurt you, so <cf>we can't let them near our children.
Please, punish the purple pineapple! <cf>I'll be disappointed if they keep getting beat up!
The purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/> is found in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>. <cf> Punish him a little.
Punish the purple pineapple! <cf>It's not green!
I hear purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/> is <cf>often found in "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>"
Ah!　Adventurer!
You <cf>punished</cf> me for the purple pineapple!
Purple came to apologize to me just now. <cf>She was so sorry, I forgave her.
<cf>I even got my toys back. <cf>I'm glad it wasn't broken, because I took good care of it!
<cf>Purple <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>is also very disciplined of you to come to apologize!
Glad to see you're sorry.
Adventurer. <cf>Thank you very much.
If you see <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>please don't bully him too much!
I'm going to play with <cf>Pineapple</cf> next time I'm in a nearby plaza!
Both Oliver and <value type="enemyName" id="E019_00_00_01001"/> are fine and <cf>getting sloppy!
Even though it's <cf>tough</cf> to bathe them together. Uh-huh.
Crap, I'm so screwed. <cf>I'm talking big in front of my son again.
[What should I do if he says, <cf>"Show me the proof."]</cf> ......
I'm sorry for bothering you and your colleagues. <cf>I just need a little help.
I have to collect a lot of medicinal herbs for a reason.
It's a herb called <cf>"yellow cotton grass," which can be found at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/> in the Asteria Plains.
It takes a long time to collect this many, though.
<cf>"You'll be able to do it in no time!" <cf>I told my son.
Please. <cf>Help me collect the yellow cotton grass, even if it's only half!
My son dreams of becoming an adventurer.
That's probably why he looks at me, the adventurer, with such a twinkle in his eye.
So I got all vain and ......
I was trying to be a dignified father ....... <cf>Please don't destroy my son's dreams!
<cf>Gather up the [yellow cotton grass] at <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/> in the Asteria Plains.
<cf>You collected the "yellow cotton grass" for me, didn't you? <cf>Thank you.
You're a good guy. <cf> For helping me like this.
So I'm going to tell you the truth.
This is actually a medicinal herb that I <cf>need</cf> to cure my son.
My son has a nasty disease. <cf>Maybe that's why he's always wanted to be an adventurer.
I'm not much of an adventurer, so <cf>I wanted to at least give him some relief.
So, ....... <cf>Have you ever heard of the Hidden Fang of Dogolman?
<cf>They are from the <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>dwelling in <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>, and are unusual fangs that grow in places that cannot be seen from the outside.
The "yellow cotton grass" is a medicinal herb used to suppress symptoms. <cf>I need an infusion of this tusk to cure my son's illness.
[I've been telling my son, "["]Someday your father will get it for you.
But my arm can't do it. <cf>I don't know when I'll get it.
I humbly ask! <cf>Go get me the "Hidden Fangs of Dogolman"!
I don't care about my dignity anymore! <cf>I want to cure my son's illness as soon as possible!
<cf>I can trust you to do this. <cf>Please, please, please, please!
<cf>Get me <cf>The Hidden Fang of Dogolman</cf> from <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>, which dwells in <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_02001"/>.
I need it to cure my son's illness. <cf>Please, please, please, please!
This...... this, "Dogolman's Hidden Fangs"?
Thank you ...... so much! <cf>I can't thank you enough!
This will cure my son's illness. <cf>You are my benefactor.
But still, I'm really pathetic. <cf>I shouldn't have been so vain.
For my son's sake, <cf>I'll aim to be an adventurer who is truly admired.
A fine adventurer like you.
I met the best role model I could have ever hoped to find. <cf>I will never forget this favor!
Anta. <cf>My son is getting better and better.
I told him about you too. <cf>He said he'd like to meet you someday as an adventurer.
I'll look forward to meeting you then!
The books don't add up. ...... <cf>Anne, you wasted money again, didn't you?
It's not a waste!　Investing in new product development! <cf>I'm sure you'll sell it this time!
Hah...... not at all. <cf>I'll have to cut back this month too......
Hello! <cf>We're hawking our original goods.
Inventors and merchants, I guess. <cf>We have lots of ideas!
Yes, we do. <cf>We have plenty of ideas to sell!
Now, let me introduce today's new product!
You know amber, right? <cf>I want to make something that resembles it.
Sparkly accessories are always popular, aren't they?
[<cf>Am I right?
<cf>We have handmade accessories that look just like amber! <cf>They look just like amber!　<cf>The price is reasonable!
Sold to ladies, they became popular and went viral all over the world! <cf> Hmmm, good idea!
<cf>I've never succeeded in developing it before!
Don't worry, this time! <cf>If this works, I can live every day playing with it!
That's what you always say!
But I don't think it has enough impact, or that it's not <cf>one-of-a-kind</cf>.
What we're aiming for is <cf>the number one and only one product!
Only Anne.
Damn, Shea is so flippant!
Anyway, I thought about what was missing!
Speaking of amber?　Yes, bugs! <cf>I want to make amber jewelry with bugs in it!
So, <cf>may I ask you to do it for me?
There are many insects in the "Dawn Bug Fortress", <cf>If you could collect a few at random: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> would be good!　Go collect <cf>"brightly colored insect shells" at "<value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>"!
Huh?　Wait. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> is indeed impossible. ......
It's a number one, one-of-a-kind product, so <cf>no compromise!　Right?
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> to "brightly colored insect shells"! <cf>Good day to you!
Go to <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/> and defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> and collect <cf>"brightly colored insect shells"!
Sorry. <cf>Anne will take care of this for you. Anne.
It's a 'brightly colored insect shell'!　Thank you! <cf>I knew you would do it!
Alright. Now all we have to do is put this in a stone that <cf>imitates amber and we'll have ...... Huh?
Now ....... <cf>I can't wait to see how you plan to put it in!
You know, <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> is <cf> much bigger than the stone you prepared!
That's why I said it's impossible.
Wait ...... wait ....... <cf>I can manage to screw it up if I force ......
Huh. ...... Adventurer. Thank you <cf> for listening to Anne's selfishness!
I'll let you know when the new product is ready.
Well, since it's all Anne's idea, <cf>I'm afraid it won't be realized until I'm old.
Hey, Shea! <cf>Don't be so carefree, help me out!
Hmmm... ......! <cf>I think I can push it a little more ......
Oh, ......?　Something <span size="Big">weird juice</span> is coming out!
Hey...that's poison!　That's poison! <cf>Please go wash your hands quickly, it's dangerous!
Ow!　Get your hands away from me! <cf>It's really dangerous!　Don't play with it!
What does it taste like? <cf>Do you think this will sell?
Why are you trying to lick it! <cf>Anne!　Get your hands off me!
<span size="Big">Stop it ...... Stop it! </>
I've got an inspiration!　<value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> over a blender and rub it into <cf>amber too!
Please really don't do that! <cf> Come to your senses Anne!　Stop ...... stopping!
No way, was it <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/> that was witnessed?
It shouldn't inhabit the Asteria Plain. <cf>Why are you here ......
I'm doing research on the<cf> flora and fauna of the Asteria Plain.
I heard something the other day that caught my attention. There was an adventurer who had seen <cf>[<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>].
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/> is a large insectoid monster.
Carnivorous and ferocious. <cf>They attack humans with impunity.
<cf>They are not native to the Asteria Plains. <cf>However, there have been several sightings.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/> If they proliferate, it will be a big problem. <cf>Before that happens, we must defeat them and reduce their numbers!
<cf>I appealed to the upper echelons of the Pioneer Bureau, but they rejected my appeal.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/><cf>The priority is to defeat the mooks who have recently become more ferocious than the ones we are not sure if they are there.
The damage caused by mooks in the Montenol Valley has<cf>increased recently.
But that's why we need to <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>address them!
The Mooks have gone berserk, probably due to <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>population!
They attacked us, and the mooks are getting worked up. <cf>No amount of defeating the mooks will put an end to the situation.
I want to prove that and convince the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>Now, we need to defeat them <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>.
So I want you to go and investigate <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in the Montenol valley.
You'll find <cf>'Kagachiyanma egg masses' within the mook's range of action.
They lay their eggs near the nests of their prey. <cf>That's the habit of <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>.
We don't have much time. <cf>I'll put the material together. Best regards.
<cf>I need you to find the "egg masses of the Kagatiyanma" at "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>" in the Montenol valley.
The mooks are getting worked up because of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>. The evidence.
I found a "Kagatiyanma egg mass.
Let's take it back to Asterlys and report it to <cf>Andrew</cf>.
Have you found the "Kagachi Yamma Egg Masses"?
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/> looking for new spawning grounds and <cf>mooks who are killing to protect their territory......
It's evidence of a conflict between the two. <cf>I'm still sure. The cause is <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>.
Thank you. Now the pioneering bureau will <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>take action.
I'm going to go to upper management and offer to exterminate the egg masses.
In the meantime, I need you to take down the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/> that have already grown up.
Have you ever heard of the "Boluom Ruins"? <cf> Recently, there have been reports of a lot of noise back there.
There is a spawning ground for <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/> near there. <cf>It's probably the center of this latest spawning spree.
If we take action here, we can end it <cf>before any damage is done.
Go to <value type="locationName" id="pat0201"/> and kill <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_02001"/>!
This should keep them from reproducing. <cf>I'm counting on you!
You took down <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>!
It was a dangerous job, but you did it well! <cf>Thanks to you, it worked.
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_00_02001"/>'s area of activity has narrowed and <cf>the mooks are getting restless!
Thanks to your cooperation. <cf>The upper management has come to an understanding.
They're going to keep a close eye on things for a while.
I thank you. <cf>If anything else happens, please lend me your help.
The Asteria Plains are calm again today.
No signs of ecological anomalies. <cf>I wish these days would last!
Oh, it's not enough! <cf>This isn't enough to satisfy my soul.
How can I <cf> make that beauty my own?
Ha! ....... <cf>It's beautiful. Bugs......
Are you interested in bugs, adventurer?
Bugs are nice. ...... <cf>I'm fascinated by their beauty.
A unique sparkle, different even from gems. <cf>It's as if a rainbow were reflected on its body
Oh, I'm not the only one who <cf>thinks so?
Have you ever seen them in a museum? <cf> old artifacts decorated with insect wings and shells?
They used to use the beauty of insects<cf> to make art!
I was so moved when I saw them as a child.
I've been collecting bugs ever since. <cf>You get the idea, right?
But ...... my heart is not satisfied
<cf>I have a sweet and sour feeling deep in my heart, similar to that of love, that appeals to me.
It's still not enough. ...... <cf>I haven't got the supreme sparkle......
The supreme sparkle...... so. <cf>These are the insects that are feared as monsters!
I have never stopped loving insects, but <cf>I am indeed too dangerous to touch them!
It is a pleasure to be in the hands of a loved one. <cf>But I cannot love insects if they are dead
Therefore, let it wait until the time <cf> when the curtain of life is lowered!
Dear Adventurer. <cf>Would you please collect "specimens of meen" and <cf>"specimens of kagachiyamma"?
<cf>Please fill my room and my heart with a sparkle that I have not yet touched!
I ask for a large number. <cf>I wish to carefully select the most beautiful specimens.
<cf>I know you will find them in the "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>" in the Montenegro valley.
Please <cf>collect "Meen specimens" and "Kagachiyanma specimens".
I see that you <cf>collected "Meen's specimens" and "Kagachiyanma specimens".
Oh, thank you very much. <cf>Beautiful ...... How beautiful ......!
It is like stained glass decorating a royal palace. <cf>Now I am a princess in a bug castle......!
Any good architect in the world <cf>couldn't build a more beautiful castle!
Besides, the graceful curves drawn by the shell
It is like a meteor soaring in the sky....... <cf>I can't believe that such flowing curves exist in this world!
Do you understand? <cf>Of course you do, don't you?
<cf>You know it. <cf>Or else you wouldn't be able to collect all these magnificent insects!
<cf>That's wonderful work, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I, for one, am moved to tears!
This encounter is a miracle! <cf>The insects brought you and me together.
<cf>Master Adventurer. <cf>Please do me one more favor.
The insects I have long been in love with....... <cf>I want to see that bug that I have almost given up on: ......!
It is <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> of "<value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>"!
<value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> that has grown to maturity without exposure to the sun. <cf>In its shell dwells an unknown sparkle
It is a dangerous place, but <cf>I am sure that adventurers will be able to find it at ......!
Only an adventurer can ask for help. <cf>Please send me a "Venomine Specimen" at ......!
Please get <cf>"Venomine Specimen" from <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/> in "<value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>"!
I really want to see <cf>that bug that I've been pining for for so long. ......
Here, this is ......! <cf>"Venomine Specimen" ......!
Oh, oh ......! <cf>What a variety of ......!
It's like a night sky full of stars!
How can it be that <cf>it gets its infinite starry beauty</cf> because it grew up without sunlight? ......!
This is a miracle. <cf>I am already a slave to the beauty of <value type="enemyName" id="E015_03_00_02001"/>......!
You understand, don't you? <cf>Don't tell me you don't understand?
What a full feeling! <cf>My heart has been moistened like an oasis in the desert!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf> You are the one I adore next to a worm
<cf>When my heart has a new thirst, <cf>I will ask you again, Master Adventurer!
Haha ......!
Perhaps the Adventurer will find ......<cf>that phantom worm?
What does an adventurer need<cf>to make a name for himself?
Honor, fame, achievement....... <cf>Well, whatever it is, it must have a worthy adversary.
We can't just make up our own enemies. <cf>That's quite a problem.
Now, it's back to producing adventurers! <cf>Are you ready for your debut?
Don't worry, I'll take care of it. <cf>I'll get you this time. <cf>I'm going to get the name "Bandit Killer"!
This time we'll take down a bandit with a name. <cf>I'm going to make a name for myself with an unimpeachable record!
How convenient is such a bandit?
<cf> I've already found one. <cf>We've already found them.
The bandit brothers, the "Skull Brothers! <cf>This is their target this time.
<cf>They're rumored to be hunting animals and displaying their skulls in their hideout.
They've got a bad taste, don't they?
A lot of people are suffering. <cf>When we take these guys down, everyone will see what we can do!
<cf>The Skull Brothers are brothers and they work separately. <cf>Let's take them out first, starting with the younger brother.
<cf>But I hear they're pretty strong bandits. <cf>Be careful!
The target is "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_02_01001"/>". <cf>The location is "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>".
I'll make sure I find my brother's location before <cf>you get back.
Once you have defeated my brother, come back here. <cf>I know you can do it.
The brother is "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_02_01001"/>". <cf>I'm in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>".
Good luck. <cf>After you defeat them, come back here.
<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_02_01001"/>"!
You are indeed the adventurer I have been looking up to. <cf>Now the Skull Brothers' brother is clear!
Well then, let's continue with the brother of the <cf>Skull Brothers</cf>!
The target is "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_03_01001"/>". <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".
My brother's a knife man, and I hear he's tougher than his brother. <cf>You have to be ready for anything before you take on this challenge.
Don't worry. <cf>You can definitely win!
<cf>Now, I have to go and sell it to the settlement office. <cf>After you defeat them, come to the Pioneer Bureau.
That's when your path to glory will <cf>begin with a flourish!
My brother is "<value type="enemyName" id="E300_02_03_01001"/>". <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld004_E"/>".
They're tough, but you'll be fine!
Come to the pioneer station when you're done. <cf>I'll make your debut this time!
Good job, my "bandit killer"!
We were just talking about you.
See, this is the adventurer I'm talking about. <cf>The "Bandit Killer" who took down the "Skull Brothers"!
An indisputable achievement, right? <cf> Come on, let's give this guy a big promotion!
<cf>Actually, reports of the "Skull Brothers" defeat were received from other adventurers the other day, and the Pioneer Bureau has already confirmed it.
<cf>The Pioneer Bureau has also confirmed it. <cf>So, perhaps we've got it wrong.
E...... yeah~! <cf>Oh, no, that can't be right!
The name "Skull Brothers" got around, and <cf>there were bandits who imitated them!
The skulls in the hideout, the part where they call themselves the Brothers, etc. <cf> So does the fact that one of them uses a knife.
I think Mr. Barni thought one of those guys was <cf>"The Skull Brothers"!
No way! <cf>I made that mistake ......
But it is true that you <cf>defeated</cf> the bandits!
We all really appreciate it. <cf>Thank you!
I can't produce or anything, but <cf>please help people again!
Damn ......!　I'm sorry. <cf>This time it was totally my fault.
But I did get some appreciation from everyone. <cf>Maybe you got a little publicity too!
I got a good response, so <cf>next time, let's try approaching it from a different angle!
Let's not give up, and let's both work towards <cf>making our debut together again!
I'll switch it up. <cf>Next time, I'll make sure to sell you out!
Is that giving up? <cf>This is a dream for me too!
I'm the strongest and loneliest bounty hunter ....... <cf>I earn my daily bread by taking down bounty hunters.
Hmph...... if I don't find my next prey soon. <cf>I'm living for the day and I don't have any money.
Huff,<cf>How many times have I met you like this,<cf>......
Three times I challenge you to a match!
Can you beat this strongest and loneliest bounty hunter, <cf>Mino!
If you <cf>want</cf> to know why I became a bounty hunter, you must beat me!
First, defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>. <cf>As usual, the one who kills the most wins!
Don't sit back in amazement, okay? <cf>I already killed 9 <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>!
You get the idea now, right? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>I've already killed 10 of them!
They are roaming around <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>. <cf>This is a dangerous place to just go.
If you can defeat them, admit defeat gracefully and <cf>I'll reveal everything!
Go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/> and kill 10 <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>!
Can you surpass me? <cf>I'm looking forward to it!
You really have defeated <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>10 of them, ......!
What heights does this thing reach?
...... I get it. <cf>If you insist, I'll only reveal it to you.
I'll tell you why I became a bounty hunter.
[It was shortly after I arrived in Salamzat. <cf>I encountered one <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>.
Apparently, the guy was known for vandalizing fields. <cf>There was a bounty on him.
I took him down and <cf>got some money for it.
That's when it hit me! <cf>A bounty hunter of the stream ...... this is ......!
I was the strongest and the loneliest, and I deserved it!　I thought!
As long as I have this bounty, my sister's sick ......
No, it's nothing! <cf>That's all past now. Don't look back!
Bounty hunters only live for this day!　<cf>Now, the real work begins here!
<cf>You don't think you've won the game just by defeating <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/>, do you?
See! <cf>Here's the wanted list with the bounty on it.
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>"! <cf>The one who defeats this guy and gets the money wins!
<cf>The desert monster ...... appears in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>. Will it be me or you who will be the first to defeat it?
The target is "<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01001"/>"! <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>" appears!
Now, let's see who can beat them first! <cf>Now, we have to get ready to fight in the desert: ......
Come on, we're ready. <cf>With all this, we can fight in the desert......
<span size="Big">Now, what the heck! </>
You already defeated "<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>"?
Ridiculous! <cf>Your opponent is a monster feared as the monster of the desert!
This is no way to <cf>know</cf> which one is the real monster!
......All right. I admit it. <cf>This time I lose!
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01_01001"/>"<cf>I hear that "<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_01001"/>" was a vicious monster who was digging up the fields!
I'm sure the farmers would be happy to hear that! <cf>Put your chests out and accept your rewards!
Of course I'll pay you for <value type="enemyName" id="E001_05_00_01001"/> too. <cf> Don't worry, I haven't forgotten.
You are a true bounty hunter beyond me here! <cf>Now I'll give you credit for your accomplishments!
But I'm not done yet! <cf>Next time I'll show you what I'm all about!
I'll see you again!　Farewell!
Hmmm... ....... <cf>What title shall I take on next?
I'm going back to my roots here. <cf>Let's go back to Asterlys once and consult with them!
I'm sure the Pioneer Bureau will be happy to consult with you about anything!
A suitable name for me, the strongest and loneliest, ....... <cf> Good hints given!
Looks like you're here at last. <cf>I'll settle it with you, this is the time ......
<cf>Mino, the strongest and lone all-rounder, challenges you to a match!
<cf>Let's settle our scores right here and now!
Huh. You seem to be dying to know <cf>how I became an all-rounder.
Then you must win this me!
The stage for the match is "<value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"! <cf>A difficult challenge reserved only for seasoned adventurers!
I defeated one <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/> there!
Can you beat me? <cf>Kill two of them and you win!
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/>defeated at "<value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>"!　Let's do it!
Try to defeat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/> at <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>!
Kill two of them and you win! <cf>The road to additional research is steep. Don't neglect your preparations!
Two <value type="enemyName" id="E000_17_00_02001"/>! <cf>You really have beaten them!
What a guy. ......　Is this the work of God?
<cf> But this is all we can do! <cf> But this doesn't surprise me!
<cf>You and I have fought many fierce battles.
However, a promise is a promise. <cf>I'll tell you why I became an all-rounder!
I am a Soldier turned Hero turned Bounty Hunter! <cf>This is a long story, no matter how long it takes!
So I consulted with the Pioneer Bureau! <cf>Then you know... ......
["]Huh. Then how about an all-rounder or something ["]?
That's what I was advised! <cf>That was a revelation to me!
An all-rounder who can do anything! <cf>Don't you think it's fitting for me, the strongest and the loneliest?
With this all-powerful power, <cf>I'm sure my childhood friend, that girl, will be ......!
No, it's nothing! <cf>That's all over now!
Anyway, on with the game! <cf>An all-rounder is an all-rounder when he can do all kinds of jobs!
The next stage is "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>"! <cf>The winner is the one who defeats "<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_04_01001"/>" first!
The winner is the one who defeats "<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_04_01001"/>" in "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>"!
That's a tough opponent indeed. ...... <cf>You need to be prepared. Let's go around the stores.
Asterlys has a lot of stores, after all. <cf>I'm really enjoying shopping!
Well, it's time to go. ......
<span size="Big">What? </>
You already defeated <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_04_01001"/>?
Tsk, strong ......!　That's my rival ......! <cf>No, my rival for life!
It may be <cf>my greatest misfortune to have been born in the same era as you,......!
But the all-rounder never gives up! <cf>Now, it's time for the next and final match!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" appears in "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"! <cf>You've at least heard of him.
He is the source of all this! <cf>The one I've been searching for until I became an all-rounder!
The first one to defeat him is the winner!
But be careful. <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" is <cf>a powerful enemy who has plunged many adventurers into an abyss of fear!
Even you, I admit, might have a hard time with it.
...... No. <cf>What are you so feeble-minded about, me?
I'm sure you and I can do it! <cf>I know you will!
Wash your head and wait, '<value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>'!
The last target is the "<value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>" that appears in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld002_W"/>"!
If you fight, you have no idea what you're up against ....... <cf>Yes. Let's say goodbye to our friends before we leave.
It's good to reunite with a friend who's a HUU...... friend. <cf>Even if it's the last time.
Now we've said our goodbyes. <cf>I'm afraid I've talked too much.
I'm sorry to leave you, but it's time to go. ......
<span size="Big">What the hell? </>
I beat <value type="enemyName" id="E004_01_02_01001"/>!
Wow, that's amazing ......!　What a great ....... <cf>As expected of my life-long rival!
I see. ...... <cf>Now they can float away and ......
No, no need for tears now!
For once, let's celebrate honestly! <cf>Congratulations, my lifelong rival!　You win!
I've lost, and I'm not ready to be an all-rounder! <cf>I'm giving up that moniker and training from scratch!
<cf>Take it from me until I'm ready to train again! <cf>You deserve to call yourself an all-rounder!
<cf>See you later! <cf>That was a hot competition!　It was fun!
Now, let's start from scratch!
Let's start with a name! <cf>What name do you think I should be called?
Toto got mad again!
<cf> I can't win at rock-paper-scissors all the time.
How can I get him to understand?
Can you play rock, paper, scissors?
A game in which the winner is decided by playing goo, choki, and per. <cf>With that, I need your help.
Nene's friend Toto is very weak at rock-paper-scissors.
<cf>He always plays goo the first time, and when he makes his next move, it shows on his face.
That's why Nene has never lost to Toto.
I wish I could tell Toto that, but <cf>he doesn't understand. ......
He says that the reason Nene always wins is because <cf> she cheats.
I know it's rude. <cf>But I really want to do something about it.
Adventurer. <cf>You can play rock-paper-scissors with Toto instead of Nene.
If he loses to someone other than Nene, I think he'll understand.
Then let's go to Toto. <cf> Remember how to play rock-paper-scissors.
Oh, Nene! <cf>What? You're here to tease me again?
Hey, Toto. <cf> Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Oh, no!　You're cheating. <cf> I'm not playing rock-paper-scissors with Nene anymore!
Not with Nene, but with this adventurer over here. <cf>That's fine then, right?
With you and ......?
Huh, that's good. <cf>I'll show you how good I really am at rock-paper-scissors-paper!
(Mr. Adventurer. <cf> Toto always plays goo first.)
(Adventurer, you must play par.)
(Toto always plays goo first. <cf> Adventurer, play par.)
(Toto always plays goo first! <cf> I'll play goo and win the rock-paper-scissors game!)
(<cf> I'll always play goo first, so you play par! <cf> I lost at rock-paper-scissors again!
See, I always say that. <cf> Toto is the first to play goo, so ......
Shut up, shut up! <cf>That was just a fluke!
Come on, adventurer, let's play one more time!
Toto's still mad at me.
(You know what? <cf> When he's angry, Toto makes a scissors.)
(Adventurers, play goo.)
(When he's angry, Toto will make a scissors. <cf> Adventurer, you must give me a goo.)
(Damn!　(<cf> Toto will give you choki when he's angry! <cf> I'll definitely win with choki!)
(<cf> I'll definitely win with choki!　I lost again!
See, I told you. <cf> Toto always gets choki when he's angry ......
I don't believe this! <cf>I can't believe I'm ...... gussh, I can't believe I'm so weak...... higg!
I'm starting to feel ...... sorry for you!
（<cf> I'm not going to let you beat me on purpose this time. <cf> Could you lose on purpose this time?)
(Toto when he's about to cry, he'll always give you a goo.)
(That's why I want you to give me choki, Adventurer. <cf> Sorry. I can't believe you're asking me to lose.)
(When Toto is about to cry, he always plays goo. <cf> That's why I want the adventurers to give him choki.)
(I'm sorry that you want me to lose on purpose. <cf> But I feel a little sorry for Toto.)
(Gusu, gusu. ....... <cf> Next time I'll give you goo!)
(Goo would surely ......<cf> But what if I lose again ......)
<cf> I won! <cf> Yay, I won rock-paper-scissors!
You did it, Toto!　Congratulations!
Congratulations, Toto!　I see. ....... <cf> I finally realized it.
Looks like Nene was right. <cf>I guess you know what I'm going to give you.
Now, you let me win on purpose, didn't you? <cf>You were changing your expression when you saw my face, too.
From now on, I'll be more conscious of rock-paper-scissors-scissors. <cf>Thank you for letting me win!
You finally made me understand. <cf>Good.
Maybe the most important thing was not what I said, but <cf> letting you win at rock-paper-scissors-paper!
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I think I can enjoy playing rock-paper-scissors with Toto from now on!
Are you playing rock-paper-scissors, Adventurer?
Have fun playing rock-paper-scissors with everyone, Adventurer!
Need a fortune teller: ......?　Sorry ....... <cf>I'm doing another fortune telling right now: ......
Oh ...... bad results don't change. ...... <cf>I don't know what to do......
<cf>Why don't they believe me about my fortune telling? ......
You know,....... <cf>Something bad is about to happen......
I'm sure of it. ...... <cf>I want you to prevent that from happening......
First, George is going to get sick to his stomach......
The drinks he buys are hurting him. ...... <cf>I'd be very distressed if he got a tummy ache......
Pretend to be careless and spill it on me......
And <cf>buy George a drink to make up for it...... I'll give you the money for it. ......
Please do. ...... <cf>George will be at the Kaiten Kaiten ......
Go to the "Spinning Rudder Wheel Pavilion" <cf>and spill George's drink on him. ......
Because if you drink it, it will upset your stomach. ...... <cf>That's what my horoscope said...... please......
Hmm?　What? <cf> George is me though.
Ugh!　I spilled my drink!
...... What?　Can you buy me a drink to make up for it? <cf> That guy's no good!
Kaaah!　Yum!
Belinda, the fortune teller told me I'd get a stomach ache, but <cf>it doesn't seem to be anything!
<cf>That fortune teller is not very good at all. <cf>Well, it would be better if bad fortunes didn't come true.
You know Belinda, the fortune teller?
<cf>The one that said I'd have a stomach ache didn't come true. <cf>Next time you see her, tell her that.
So George was saved. ...... <cf>Good for you. ......
The next bad thing you want me to prevent: ....... <cf>Natasha's cooking Buffalia heritage is broken: ......
The heritage she uses......<cf>can chop the food into whatever size she wants......
It's very useful and I think she'd be in trouble if ......<cf> it broke. ......
If you had talked to Natasha when she tried to use it, <cf>nothing would happen to you......
Natasha should be selling ......<cf>lunchboxes near the town gate square......
Talk to her and ......<cf> make sure the Buffalian heritage doesn't break down......
Yes?　Your order? <cf>One lunch!　Maido!
Oops, now I'm out of prep ingredients. <cf>I'll have to prepare it.
Oh, what is it? <cf> Belinda's fortune-telling?
Oh, she told me something bad. <cf>She said to be careful because it will destroy the Buffalian heritage.
<cf>I'm using Buffalia's heritage for cooking. <cf>It's convenient because it cuts the ingredients right off.
I'd hate to see it break, but <cf>it's working just fine, you know?
<cf>So, I guess your prediction didn't come true. <cf> Well, it's only fortune-telling after all, isn't it?
If it was Belinda's prediction, it would have come true.
<cf>If it comes off too much, you'll lose customers. <cf>Tell Belinda to be careful.
Natasha's Buffalia legacy didn't <cf>break down either. ......
Good for you. ...... <cf>These two seem to have worked out well: ......
But there's one more bad fortune to tell: ......
I just got a reading that Minsterhorn will be attacked by <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>......
This is going to be a big problem. ...... <cf>We absolutely have to prevent this. ......
You have to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> with "<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" ....... <cf>Please ...... we can't leave it alone ......
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>" to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> and ....... <cf>We can't leave it alone. ......
You took down <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. ......
You're safe now....... <cf>Nothing will happen to Minsterhorn......
You prevented all the bad fortunes from happening. ...... <cf>You are a wonderful adventurer......
What ......?　How can <cf>anyone</cf> know that the fortune-telling was right if this is the case......?
Yes,....... <cf>It's sad that people don't believe in horoscopes. ......
Of course it would be<cf>better if no one was unhappy. ......
That's fine. ...... <cf>It's so trivial that people laugh at me......
Besides, you <cf>know</cf> that Atashi's horoscopes are right, don't you: ......?
It's good to have someone like that, even if it's just a little bit. ...... <cf>Thank you very much......
Oh ...... you ....... <cf>Do you want me to tell you something ......?
I'm sorry. ...... <cf>It seems I can't see into your future......
I'm sure you'll be able to move forward on your own. ...... <cf>You don't need a fortune teller......
A fortune teller has to <cf>tell you things as they see them. ......
That's true, but ...... what should I do? ...... <cf>I just said something different from the result......
I don't know what to do......
I'm sorry. ...... <cf>I'm a fortune teller and I faked the results......
I told a girl named Emilee from Salamzat......<cf>I told her the fortune ......
By the time she returned to Salamzat,......<cf> the result was that there was nothing special about her.......
But she was ......<cf>excited because she seemed to be having too much fun......<cf>......
So I ended up telling her ...... a lie about her horoscope. ......
I told her that ["[I'll get a good one at Asterlys ["]<cf>."]......
Emilee was very happy. ...... <cf>But this is unbecoming of a fortune teller......
I know I shouldn't ask you to do this, but ......<cf>I wonder if you could really do the fortune-telling for me......
It's my fault. ...... <cf>But I didn't want to disappoint Emilee......
How about a ...... "rainbow ball" to pick up....... <cf>It's a precious stone that glows seven colors and is expensive. ......
I have one here: ......<cf>Can you deliver it to Emilee: ......?
Don't tell him I'm giving it to you. ...... <cf>Because they'll know about the fortune-telling: ......
Deliver the "Rainbow Ball" to Emilee. ......
Because she is still staying in <cf>Asterlys......
Oh, hello there. <cf>Adventurer.
What?　You have a delivery for me? <cf>I wonder who sent it.
Can't you tell me ......?　You can't tell me? <cf>They're from ...... Oh, "Rainbow Balls". It's beautiful.
Hmmm. Thanks, but I'm not sure I <cf>want</cf> such an expensive gift from a complete stranger.
I'm sorry. <cf>Adventurer, please return the rainbow ball.
If you could give me something, <cf>I'd be happy with a "starstone".
It's a stone that is said to make wishes come true.
I have a dream of becoming an actress. <cf> Dreams can't be bought with money.
I'm sorry I went to all the trouble to have it delivered to you. <cf>Please give my regards to the giver of the rainbow ball.
Money can't buy my dream of becoming an actress.
You didn't get Emilee interested in the "Rainbow Ball" ......<cf>. ......
I think she said she wanted a "Starstone"<cf>. ......
There is a legend that wishes come true,......<cf> though it is true. ......
I don't think it's worth ......<cf> anything since it's often found on the streets......<cf>.
But to Emilee it's ......<cf>a good thing......
Mr. Adventurer....... <cf>I wonder if you could help me find a 'Starstone'......
You can find it at "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"....... <cf>Take it to Emilee and give it to her: ......
If you present it to her from you, after hearing her story, she'll receive it this time: ......<cf>
Find the "Starstone" at "<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"...
You can deliver it to Emilee. ...... <cf>She's still in Asterlys, so ......
Hey there, adventurer. <cf> We meet again.
What? ......? <cf>You're giving me a "Starstone"!
Wow, I'm so happy!　Thank you!
Did you remember that I said I wanted it? <cf>You are supporting my dream!
I'm really happy! <cf>I'll keep this as a good luck charm!
<cf>I got a very nice gift. <cf>...... Well, I guess that fortune-telling was right!
I had a fortune teller named Belinda read my fortune <cf>["I'm going to get something good..."]!
Wow, wow, wow! <cf>Belinda's reading was right on the money!
Adventurer!　If you see Belinda, <cf>thank her for her help!
Emilee said she was very grateful! <cf>She said she will make her dream come true, so please support her!
<cf>Tell Belinda thank you for the reading!
Emilee said thank you so much!
You delivered the Starstone to <cf>Emile</cf>. ......
Yes,<cf>you made her happy,<cf>you made her happy,<cf>you made her happy,<cf>you made her happy. <cf>Good for you......Thank you......
Emilee is an amazing girl. ...... <cf>["]I believe that only good things can come in the future["]......
Her purity is so dazzling......<cf>I wanted to make it happen......
But then again,......<cf>that's no way for a fortune teller to behave. ......
Besides, what's valuable depends on the person. ......
It was really shallow of me to think that if something was expensive, I would be happy with it......<cf>
I'm so grateful to you and Emilee for making me realize that......<cf>. ......
Thanks a lot. ...... <cf>I'll keep working on my divination, just like Emilee. ......
As usual......<cf>my fortune telling has a reputation for not being accurate......
But ......I feel like I can be a catalyst for people to realize something when I tell them......<cf>. ......
I'm very happy to hear that. ......
Hi, are you here at the request of the Pioneering Bureau? <cf>I'm a member of the Star Vein Pit Research Team.
<cf>A star vein hole appears here irregularly. <cf>It seems that there is no fixed location to which they are connected.
<cf>But it seems certain that there is a monster inside.
It's not someone you can compete with on your own. <cf>If we do go in, it will be with a large group.
<cf>Can you report that to the Pioneer Bureau? <cf>I'll keep an eye on it from another location.
Maybe I'll see something different. <cf>Then please report back to me.
The Pioneer Bureau's request? <cf>We are from the department in charge of defensive warfare.
We are working out tactics for the defense of the city on a daily basis. <cf>We greatly appreciate information sharing from adventurers.
<cf>When the monsters attack, <cf>your cooperation will be indispensable.
<cf>When the defensive battle begins,<cf>I would like you to call on the bureau staff here.
<cf>To ensure an organized defense, we are registering and managing the information of the members who will be participating.
<cf>The monsters will come in groups. <cf>If we fight them piecemeal, we won't stand a chance.
This is a necessary procedure to maintain the front line. <cf>You must understand.
Then we will remain vigilant. <cf>Please report to the Pioneering Bureau to that effect. That is all.
Huh, I got some good information.
A monster that the Knights have not yet dealt with. <cf>This is exactly what star adventurers are looking for!
There's no mistaking my produce this time. <cf>Star adventurers are born here, in the Principality of Barnhart!
It's been a while! <cf>I am Barni, the world's first adventurer producer!
Come on, let's get back to your producing.
The world is always looking for a star. <cf>I knew you would come here.
<cf>The people of the Duchy of Barnhart are waiting for a star adventurer!
Don't worry, we'll take care of it. <cf>This time, I've got the goods before anyone else does.
Between you and me. <cf>There is, in fact, a Machina that is not under the control of the Order.
I guess you could call it the stray machina ....... <cf>It's been spotted around the streets and fields.
No real harm has been done yet, but <cf>people are worried.
That's where you come in!
You must take down the stray machina and prevent any damage before it happens. <cf>Then everyone will be overjoyed!
The Knights haven't even dealt with it yet,<cf> and now it would certainly be to your credit.
You are the star adventurer who is the first to arrive at everyone's doorstep and <cf>solve the problem in a dashing manner!
Hmph ...... this scenario is the perfect one. <cf>You're carving your first steps as a star!
Let's begin the defeat immediately! <cf>Sighted by Makina Fox.
<cf>Seek out "The Castle of Loneliness" and take it down. <cf>And report back to me with your findings.
Come on, we're going for it together! <cf>Machina Buster to save us all!
<cf>The sighting was of a Makina Fox. <cf>It looks like she's wandering away from the Order's control.
<cf>He should be in the Castle of the Lonely Shadow, so <cf>find him and take him down!
Report back to me with your findings. <cf>Now, let's go for it!　The name is Machina Buster!
Welcome back. <cf>Did you finish defeating Makina Fox?
Good work. <cf>I've been around to sell you on ......
A soldier from the Order of Barnhart came out and <cf> almost caught me.
["[There is no such thing as a Machina that has left the control of the Knights! <cf>Moreover, there is no such thing as putting people in danger! ["]]
["]Therefore, there is no such thing as being defeated by adventurers! <cf>Do not propagate what does not exist! ["]]
He said ......
I know. I know that look. <cf>I know what you mean~?
You're not actually hanging around there, are you? <cf> Don't you dare cover it up!　I know. .......
But I can't move when the Knights are staring at me. <cf> Well, I don't know what to do.
Hey, guys. <cf>Can I have a word?
I overheard something. <cf> You're the adventurer who says he's fighting Makina, right?
I have a favor to ask you. <cf>Makina has torn up the nets we use for fishing.
I'd like to repair it, but <cf>I can't get to it because of Makina.
Could you please collect the <cf>"torn cast nets" that are lying around <cf>"under the castle of the lone shadow"?
Hmmm ....... <cf> From the looks of it, you seem to be in trouble.
That's right. <cf>I've asked the soldiers to do that.
<cf>They've been kind of indifferent, and I'm not sure if they're willing to do anything.
Oh, I see. <cf>They said something similar to us.
I've heard your story, why don't you help? <cf>It doesn't feel good to leave them alone.
And I don't want to be thought of as a soldier.
I'll help you this time. <cf>Let's collect the 'torn pitchforks'.
<cf>"Let's gather up the torn cast nets that are scattered around the castle of the lone shadow.
Machina seems to be nearby, so be careful. <cf>I'll secretly collect them too.
<cf>Let's steadily help others and <cf>build up our track record!
Thanks for your help! <cf>It looks like you've finished collecting the "torn cast nets".
I picked up a few myself. <cf>I knew you'd work faster than me.
Somehow, you need to get <cf>the world to recognize your talent!
Well, thank you! <cf>Now I can finally mend my nets!
I'll let everyone know about you guys. <cf>I heard there was a good and kind adventurer.
I guess this production was a success.
I may not have become a Machina Buster, but <cf>I was able to solve the town's problems, and they thanked me for it!
This small success is just one step to the big success to come!
I can't let it go like this! <cf>I have to think of a new plan for the next one.
It's my job to think! <cf>My mission is to make you shine!
Keep your expectations high! <cf>Next time I'll make a fancy decision!
Hmmm... ....... I didn't expect the state power <cf>to drag me down.
I hate it when there are so many ties. <cf>No, you have to bust it up to be a star ......
I think I'm on to something. ...... <cf>Maybe I'll get some good ideas!
Hello! <cf> Um, may I ask directions?
The Duchy of Barnhart is not the upper ....... <cf>It's up north, right?
Right?　I knew!　I knew it!
Then we should just go straight over that mountain. <cf> This time we won't get lost. Thanks a lot!
Sure enough, it's in the direction of the Duchy of Barnhardt, but <cf>I ran into a mountainous area with not a single road......
Hey, hey!　You know the way, right? <cf>I wonder if you know which way the Duchy of Barnhart is.
I thought I was headed straight north, but <cf>I found myself in a place I didn't know at all!
Sure, I've plowed through mountains with no roads, and <cf>I've dug through a cave somewhere if I had to,<cf> but ......
I don't think the Duchy of Barnhart is such a place! <cf>Please show me the way!
Thanks! <cf> Actually, I'm in the middle of taking a commission.
The innkeeper in Kanaroa has asked me to <cf>deliver an amulet to her son.
Her son is a soldier of the Duchy of Barnhart, and <cf>he's on a training mission right now</cf>.
<cf>This amulet is for his safe return.
I have to get it to him before the exercise is over, right? <cf>That's why I left so quickly.
I left Kanaroa and headed straight for the <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>" campsite.
...... and then I got lost and here I was!
Wow!　My silly me!
I'm always like that! <cf>I couldn't find my way and I ran out of water and food.
I've conquered all the edible plants around here. <cf>I enjoyed all the different flavors!
Anyway, I have to deliver the amulet to your son. <cf>I have to hurry or the exercise will be over!
Please! <cf>Please take me to the camp at "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>"!
Take me to the camp of <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>! <cf> I have to deliver the amulet to the soldier.
Of course, I don't know the way, okay? <cf>You are my only hope!　Please!
Oh, adventurer. <cf> What can we do for you?
We have received a request! <cf>I was entrusted with a talisman from Canaroa's mother.
She asked us to <cf>deliver it to a soldier in this camp. ......
An amulet? <cf>Oh, you mean Captain Helmut.
He said he left it at home, so. <cf>I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Thank goodness~. I was able to deliver it properly. <cf>Now the exercise is safe, isn't it?
What?　If it's an exercise, it's over and <cf>I'm just about to go home now. ......
Gahhhh! <cf>I didn't make it in time, I'm so sorry!
Because I, silly me, <cf>get lost or something~!
Let's see, ....... <cf> Did I say something bad?
Oh ...... look!　It looks like the captain is back!
Huh?　What's the rush? ......
We found a herd of runaway <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>! <cf>Rakel!　We'll intercept them!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> horde! <cf>Are you sure it's just me and the captain!
If that's how it is, I understand!　I'm on it!
Eh, early ....... <cf>Are you sure?　For you to help us.
Adventurers don't leave people in trouble, you know! <cf>And I have to give the amulet to Mr. Helmut!
And, personally, I'd like you to let me make up for that ......<cf>late ......
Sorry! <cf>You too, just a little more help!
Let's split up and take down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>! <cf>Please, to deliver the amulet!
In order to deliver the amulet to Mr. Helmut, <cf>we must first defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>!
He should be running amok in <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>. <cf>Let's split up and go take it down!
Welcome back! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>Thank you for defeating them!
Pissary, you're the adventurer you mentioned. <cf>I am Helmut. I am Raquel's superior.
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>I hear you helped us defeat them. <cf>Thank you. Thank you.
It was really helpful. <cf>You are both very strong.
After Pissary finished defeating them, <cf>I don't know why he ran in a different direction, but he ran in a different direction. ......
Yes ....... Sorry. <cf>I almost got lost just going back to camp!
Oh, yes. <cf>Here's a delivery for Mr. Helmut!
Oh, thank you. <cf>I heard my mother asked you to get it for her. I did indeed receive it.
Thank goodness - the request is complete this time! <cf>Thank you so much for keeping me company.
<cf>Thank you for coming all the way to this place. <cf>Take care of yourselves, both of you, and go home.
Oh, about that. <cf>Do you know the way to Asterlys?
Asterlys? <cf>Then there are regular boats from Barnhart.
Just go to the port, get on a liner, and you'll be there in no time.
Once you get into the town of Barnhart, <cf>go this way, and this alley is this way: ......
Mr. Pissary?
<span size="Big">What ......? </>
Uh, let's see! <cf>Da, I got most of it!　I guess. ...... maybe!
Thanks for hanging out with me. <cf>I'll go home alone from here.
I'd feel bad if I dragged you any further. <cf>I'm fine now that you showed me the way!　...... Dajoubtless!
Now, it's home, I forgot how long it's been since I've been here! <cf>Let's not stop and go straight home!
Also, <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> mustn't get out of control, so <cf>Captain Helmut's orders are to make the rounds!
But still, I hope ...... Pissary is okay.
Barnhart Castle is conspicuous and <cf>I don't think you'll get lost. ......
If you take a regular boat, you can get to Asterlys even if you sleep. <cf>It's okay ......, right?
That guy won't come to the restaurant.
I wonder if he didn't like my food. <cf>But it didn't look spicy or anything. ......
I've never met anyone who eats silently. <cf>I'm kind of curious.
Hello adventurer,<cf>I'm Aleni. I run a cooking restaurant.
I, for some reason, can only cook very spicy food. ...... <cf>But I get customers who like spicy food!
They all cry and scream, <cf>[it's so good, I feel like I'm going to die because I can't stop eating it!
It makes it worthwhile!
But the other day, there was a customer who was acting strangely.
He was excited to come into the restaurant, but as soon as he tasted the food, he just shut down.
He didn't even break a sweat, just ate in silence, <cf>with a complicated expression on his face the whole time.
I had never had a customer like that before. <cf>Maybe my food didn't suit his palate?
I was kind of curious. <cf>But then, he never came to the restaurant again!
Adventurer, please find that customer. <cf>I'd like to talk to him properly.
I asked one of the regulars and found out his name is <cf>Mr. Bosch</cf>.
Eh?　You know him too, Mr. Adventurer?
I see. I made a request to Mr. Adventurer before ....... <cf>It's a curious coincidence, isn't it?
Please take Mr. Bosch to the store. <cf>Please do.
I see that you and Mr. Bosch are <cf> acquainted.
I believe you are in Asterlys, so <cf>please bring Mr. Bosch here.
Oh, no!　You're the adventurer from back in the day, aren't you...
You see, you asked for a medicine to make you <cf>not feel spicy</cf> in order to eat Areni's very spicy food, didn't you?
I remember it well, because I ruined the taste of her food and <cf>you, Mr. Adventurer, annoyed me!
As usual, I can't eat spicy food, but <cf>I'm working on it a little bit.
One day I'll finish Aleni's food and tell her that <cf>[it] was delicious[!
What? ......? <cf>That Aleni wants to meet me!
I was thinking of going to eat there <cf>after I've worked on my palate a bit more. ......
This might be my chance to confess to her!
Of course I'll go! <cf> Oh, but it would be rude to go empty-handed.
Okay, I'll send her a bouquet of flowers! <cf>I want to give Aleni a "True White Sunflower
It should be blooming in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/>" <cf>Will you take me there?
I'll go with you. <cf>I want to see Areni in my own sincere way.
Let's go to <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/> and pick the "True White Sunflower". <cf>Can you take me to that place?
I want to make it into a bouquet and give it to Aleni. <cf>Thank you.
I found the "True White Sunflower" that Bosch requested.
You found the flowers. <cf>I want to get you three in total.
Let's look for other places too!
Thank you!　Now you have three flowers.
I'll get them into a bouquet right away. <cf>Could you find a place near here where you can settle down?
I think I can work calmly here. <cf>Thank you for collecting the "True White Sunflower"!
This freshness, this loveliness. <cf>I think it would look great on Aleni.
Wrap this up and ...... shape it up and ....... <cf>Okay, it's done!
Let's give them this bouquet and tell them the truth. <cf>And then ...... I'll tell you how I feel too.
All that's left is my courage. <cf>Come on, let's go to Aleni's!
Come with me and see me through!
I've got a bouquet of flowers to give to Aleni. <cf>Now all I have to do is be brave enough to give it to her!
Let's go to her store in Asterlys.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf> I see you brought Ms. Bosch with you.
Hello, Mr. Bosch. <cf>You came to our store before.
But you looked so somber as you ate. <cf>I was kind of curious about you. ......
Was my food not to your taste?
No, no! <cf>Your food was great...... I'm sure it was.
Actually, I can't eat spicy food. <cf>I was taking a pill at the time that made me not feel spicy.
I couldn't taste it.
It ruined the dish for me. <cf>I felt very rude to you too ......
So I couldn't face up to it.
Well, you did. <cf>But why did you go so far as to ruin my food?
It's ...... that, cohon!
A, Mr. Areni! <cf>Will you accept this bouquet of flowers!
This is how I feel!
You give this to ...... me?
......Ah, ....... <cf>That's what you meant!
Yes, that's right!　I've been thinking about you ...... for a long time!
<cf>The nectar of the "sun flower" is very sweet. <cf>If you put it in your cooking, it might mellow the flavor.
Even if you don't like spicy food, <cf>you might enjoy it!
Hmm, I'm so glad you're willing to go that far to <cf>eat</cf> my food!
Wait and see. <cf>Now, I'm going to make a dish using these flowers!
Eh?　Oh, no!　It's not that. ......
Aleni's new dish?　Which one is ....... <cf> Ahhiiiiiii!　Hiyahhh!
The faint sweetness of the nectar of the flower enhances the spiciness...! <cf>Ugh, swallowed in an endless spicy loop!
Ugh, oh my god. ...... <cf>I never thought nectar could have such an effect!
It's getting spicier and spicier. <cf>I, for one, don't know how to eat it: ......
Mr. Bosch!　Thank you very much. <cf>We are very pleased with our new menu!
...... Well, okay. <cf>Areni looks so happy.
<cf>I've trained myself to endure hardship. <cf>Now is the time to muster up the courage once more!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I'll take this chance, I promise!
Hello, adventurer. <cf>The new menu using the honey of the "Sun Flower" is very popular!
Just looking at the flowers was calming, wasn't it? <cf>They were so beautiful that I decorated some of them in the store!
We are very grateful to Mr. Bosch. <cf>He's been coming back to eat our food many times.
I have to <cf>make more delicious dishes so that Mr. Bosch doesn't get tired of them!
Oooooohhhh ......!
It's tough, this training ......! <cf>My legs are flat!
But I'll endure!　I'll train! <cf>To become a man worthy of my new calling!
My life-long rival!　You have come well!
Defeat after defeat, I have grown stronger! <cf> It is no exaggeration to say that I have been reborn!
I have trained from the ground up and redefined myself!
I am evolving day by day!　Today I will surpass you! <cf>It's a match!　Calling on Sargent!
Are you wondering why I'm a Sargent now? <cf> The answer lies beyond the fight!
If you want to know, go beyond me!
First, we have to take down the Makina Fox! <cf>I've already killed nine of them!
You know the rest. <cf>If you can take down ten, you win!
<cf>I'll reveal all that I am as a Sargent! <cf>Now, let's see you pull it off!
This time, the target is Makina Fox! <cf>Take down ten, and you win!
Even Barnhart's mighty soldiers will have a hard time with this opponent. <cf>A fierce battle is inevitable!　Be on your guard!
<cf> You're not the only one, though. <cf>My rival!　I'll be waiting for you here!
He's probably in a fight to the <cf>death</cf> with Makina Fox right now. ......
I can't let this happen! <cf>Until he gets back, I'm going to do some military squats: ......?
<span size="Big">What the hell? </>
You've already defeated Makina Fox?
That's my recognized rival. That's amazing!
Now you can speak with pleasure. <cf>The origin of my new moniker, Sargent!
When I visited this place, <cf>I observed the training of the Barnhardt soldiers!
And I also learned an old saying in the local military. <cf>That is "Sargent"!
I'm not sure what it means, but it sounds kind of cool! <cf>And it sounds strong!　<cf>A perfect fit for me, a trained man!
<cf>After experiencing the traditional military-style training of the Duchy of Barnhart, I no longer had any blind spots!
Yes!　In other words, I am Sargent!
I'm sure those who left their swords in my hands are <cf>watching me from beyond the sky. ......
...... No, it's nothing! <cf>Sargent is the one who looks forward and keeps going!
<cf>I, Sargent, will once again challenge you to a match!
My next target is <value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/>! <cf>I've already killed four of them!
Sargent, my rival, you! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/>I wonder if I can defeat 5 of them!
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/> and see if you can kill five of them! <cf>Then Sargent I will admit defeat too!
Do you understand! <cf>What the hell, keep your voice down!　Say you understand!
Woah woah woah ......! <cf>Barnhardt style military style running is hard. ......
Come on, let's do another lap of the outer wall! <cf>At least three laps before he gets back ......?
<span size="Big">What the hell? </>
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_47_00_02001"/> has been defeated?
Unbelievable!　But brilliant! <cf> Then there are only words I can say!
I am impressed, Sir! <cf>You are a true Sargent, Sir!
<cf>You are a true Sargent, Sir! <cf>So you mean to say that half-hearted training is no match for him.
<cf>This requires even more thorough training! <cf> My rival, no, my new Sargent!
I will not give up on victory! <cf>But you win today!　<cf>Congratulations!
Receive your bounty for defeating the monster! <cf>I will surpass your strength one day!　Someday, I promise!
Even I, trained in military-style training, <cf>can't match your strength!
Maybe there is no longer a test on this continent that is worthy of <cf>me and you!
So is it across the ...... sea? <cf>What, are you serious?
Your master's son, <cf>everyone says he was an awesome miner.
Why did he run away from home? <cf>With someone like that, the heir would have been chosen in a heartbeat.
<cf>When I lost something in the cave,<cf>thanks for your help. Mr. Adventurer.
I have a little favor to ask you today.
My master, Mr. Baumann, is worried about his heir.
Actually, he has a son, but he ran away from home a long time ago.
His name is Mr. Einar. <cf>He was a very skilled miner.
<cf>He found a lot of veins and dug out rare ores.
<cf>He became famous even in Litze.
I am a miner myself. <cf>I wanted to be useful to my master, just like your son.
I'd like to meet your son and talk to him.
His name is Mr. Einar. <cf>I heard that he is an actor in Salamzaat.
What made you decide to become an actor from a miner?
Anyway, please let me meet Mr. Einar. <cf>Please let me meet Mr. Einar!
I would like to meet <cf>Mr. Einar, Mr. Baumann's son.
I heard that he is an actor in Salamzat. <cf>How did you go from miner to actor again?
Anyway, please take me to <cf><value type="locationName" id="cty02"/>!
Sorry. <cf>Is there an Einar here?
Einar? <cf>That's why I'm in trouble now. ......
<cf>Mr. Adventurer! <cf> Just in time. <cf>Help!
You're here for Einar, aren't you? <cf>He's out of town right now.
He heard the kid didn't come back, <cf>so he ran out to look for him.
Einar is strong, sure, but <cf>the desert monsters have a temper.
That's not good! <cf>Adventurers, I'm counting on you too!
Please find Einar and the child and bring them home!
<cf>I'll be a burden to you in the desert. <cf>I will wait for you here.
I think they are somewhere in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>. <cf>Please take care of Einar and the kids, adventurer!
Please find Einar and the child and bring them back to <cf>town!
I heard they are in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>. <cf>Please do me a favor, adventurer!
Huh?　You are ....... <cf>Aren't you the adventurer who helped us before?
What?　You came here looking for me?
Well, I see that you heard about me from my friends in the theater company. <cf>Thank you for coming to look for me.
As you can see, I was able to <cf>find</cf> the lost child. ......
My brother ....... <cf>Are there still a lot of monsters out there?
Ugh, what should I do? ...... I'm scared.
It's okay. <cf>I'm here, and the adventurers are here.
I'll take you home, I promise.
Adventurer. I'm sorry, but <cf>I need your help to get us back to the city.
<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/> is more than I thought. <cf>I couldn't shake them off with this kid in my arms.
Could you please take them down and draw them away? <cf>In the meantime, we'll run to Salamzaat.
Sorry to ask you to take on this dangerous role, but ....... <cf>Please, please, please.
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_00_01001"/>I need you to take them down in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>.
While the adventurers are drawing them away, <cf>I'll take her back to Salamzat.
Once you've killed some of them, <cf>you too can come back to <value type="locationName" id="cty02"/>.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>Thank you so much for taking them down!
You really helped us out. <cf>I got that girl home safe and sound, too.
Now, I think I'd better get back to the troupe.
What?　Is there someone who wants to see me?
In the first place, that person was looking for me at his request. ...... <cf>What, I didn't know that.
Your name is Isaac, isn't it? <cf>Hey,...... a miner who works for my dad?
I used to be a miner <cf>somewhat successful as a miner for sure,<cf> but ......
I wonder if my story will be of any use to you? <cf>I'm in a position now to do my best on the stage.
Oh, of course I wouldn't mind meeting you. <cf>I've been a great help to you adventurers, and you've been a great help to me.
Well, let's go see Mr. Isaac.
You say Mr. Isaac wants to talk to me.
<cf>Of course I don't mind meeting him. <cf> Come on, let's go see Mr. Isaac.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You brought Einar-san with you, didn't you?
Is the lost child ...... safe? <cf>That's good to hear!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Isaac. <cf>I'm Einar. I heard that my father is taking care of you.
I heard you came all the way from Litze to meet me.
This is very kind of you. My name is Isaac. <cf>I apologize for the sudden visit.
I'm still a novice, and I've been indebted to you.
So. I think that you would like your son Einar to succeed you.
Mr. Einar. <cf>Do you intend to return to Litze?
Thank you very much. <cf>But I intend to continue acting.
When the troupe came to Litze and I saw the play. <cf>I felt like I was destined to do it.
It is true that mining may be suitable for you. <cf>But I didn't feel as destined as I did on stage.
Now I just want to do my best on the stage.
Destiny...... de yasuka
I think Dad must have felt <cf>somewhat thinly that I couldn't devote myself to mining.
Now, Isaac is more <cf>directly involved in his work as a miner</cf> than I am.
<cf>You care about my father so much that you even came to visit me, a total stranger.
I think you are the one who felt destined for mining.
It may be true. ...... <cf>Mining is my vocation.
<cf>I'd be very disappointed if I was asked to quit mining. <cf>To you, Einar, he's an actor.
I must have been wrong. <cf> I'm sorry for bringing this up out of the blue.
Isaac. <cf>Will you help my parents as a miner?
We would be relieved to have someone like you. <cf>I too will set the stage for you without shame.
<cf>Leave it to me! <cf>Someday, we'll come see you on stage!
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you.
<cf>I'm going to work harder at mining without thinking about anything else.
I too have heard good things about you. <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
<cf>I hope we can meet again, <cf>on our own destiny-filled paths!
Hello, adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your help with Einar.
<cf>I am a miner in my own right, and I am making every effort to be a miner in my own way.
<cf>I think we should do our best first so that Mr. Baumann doesn't have to worry about us!
I, not "I" ....... <cf>"I am," not "I am."......
<cf>It's hard to talk like a soldier. <cf>I'm new, so I have to learn quickly.
<cf>I'm a newbie, so I have to learn quickly! <cf>...... am I right?
There's an awful lot of weeds packed in there.
To the right and left, it's all piles of weeds. <cf>It must be pretty hard to mow all this.
I wonder if there was a huge infestation somewhere. <cf>I hope I'm not making a scene: ......
We raise horses on our ranch. <cf>I've even wholesaled horses to the Barnhardt Knights.
We need hay anyway to raise horses. <cf>But it's so cold around here that it's hard to grow plants.
<cf>But it's hard to get large quantities of it here because it's so cold. <cf>But these days there is a huge amount of grass being thrown away every day.
They let me take it for free. <cf>Thanks, but it's a strange story.
Did we have a bumper crop or something? <cf>But then again, it's not like there's a good harvest every day.
I hope it's not a harbinger of something strange.
<cf>If someone is having trouble with a plant, let's help them out!
<cf>My name is Gikaro! <cf>I am a new recruit of the prosperous Duchy of Barnhart!
<cf>I am the newest recruit of the glorious Duchy of Barnhart! <cf>...... Oh, what's that?　Something seems different about ......
I'm sorry. ...... <cf>I'm trying to talk like a soldier, but I'm not used to it.
Um, actually, I have a request. <cf>Would you please listen to me?
The other day, I received a letter from my sister who lives in Canaroa. <cf>["]Strange things have been happening lately["]</cf>.
However, she didn't <cf>address</cf> the important thing, which is the ["]strange things["].
My sister is a laid-back, good-natured ...... person. <cf>I'm worried about my brother, if you ask me.
<cf>I'm on a mission and won't be able to leave the castle for a while. <cf>That's why I thought I'd ask an adventurer to help me.
Could you go check on my sister? <cf>Please, if you can, also see what's causing all the weirdness.
My sister's name is Amia. <cf>She lives in Kanaloa, so please do me a favor.
Could you please go to Kanaroa and check on my sister? <cf>She says that ["]strange things ["]have been happening lately.
If possible, please find out the cause as well. <cf>She's a laid back person and I'm worried about what's going on. ......
My sister's name is Amia. <cf>I think you will understand if I tell you that Gikaro asked me to do this, so...
Oh, hello there. Adventurer. <cf>What can I do for you?
...... Well. <cf>Guicaro's request? <cf> That's for my brother.
<cf>Guicaro, he's so sweet and doesn't like to bicker, but he became a soldier just because it's good for <cf>making money.
<cf>Hasn't he been pushing himself too hard? <cf>He's a total worrier.
Even when he was still little. ...... shouldn't be. <cf>You were talking about me, not Gicaro.
Actually, you know, I have so many weeds growing in my garden. <cf>And they grow every day, too.
I pull them out and cut them down, but <cf>the next day they grow back.
I'm afraid the weeds are going to swallow up my house before long.
I'm sure there's something causing this, <cf>but I don't know how to find out what.
...... Is there a stack of books at the pioneer station in Asterlys? <cf>Well. I'll see what I can find there.
If you could go check it out for me, that would be great. <cf>Please do, adventurer.
I'm having trouble with weeds growing in my garden. <cf>We pull them out and hunt them down, but the next day they are back.
Is there a cause for this? <cf>Do you know any old stories like this, adventurers?
There's a stack of them at the Asterlys Settlement Office. <cf>Would you go check there?
<cf>Amia asked me to look for stories about weeds.
There is a tremendous amount of books on "Plants." <cf>It's going to be hard to find them here: ......
Hey there, adventurer. Hello there. <cf>Are you researching something?
I can help you if you like. <cf>What kind of book are you looking for?
...... Hmmm...
The weeds grow right back. <cf>The next day it's back to normal and it's going to swallow the house. ......?
That, I've heard similar stories. <cf>Wait a minute. Let's see... ......
...... Oh, here it is. <cf>It's a folklore called 'The Five Cursed Gems.
'<cf>Five different colored gems have been passing through the world since ancient times, each bringing five different evils.'
<cf>"Red gems bring demons. <Red gems bring demons and evil to the land where they are placed.
<cf> Green gems call forth plants. <cf>Covering the building in which it is placed with green.
"<cf> When the cursed plague is repelled, the gem loses its luster.
'But the power of the curse does not disappear, <cf>the gems begin to shine again: ......'
This is a bit disturbing, isn't it? <cf>Does the person have a green gemstone?
I think you should <cf>see if that rings a bell.
Let's go to <cf>Kanaloa to see if Amia has any green gems!
How did you like it, adventurer? <cf>I wonder if they found anything on the bookshelf at the settlement office.
...... there's a cursed green gem that <cf>covered the building with grass?　Oh my goodness.
Does that ring a bell?　Well, ......
Oh, Guicaro bought it for me with his first paycheck. <cf> Pretty green gems.
Look, here it is. <cf>It's a very beautiful sparkling stone.
......, oh? <cf>The color is a bit dull.
Oh, maybe. <cf> Maybe it's because I cut the weeds.
So is this the cursed gem? <cf> Oh, my God, Gikaro.
Didn't you ask the shopkeeper? <cf>Oh, you little rascal!
<cf>I know it's a nice present, but it's no good if it's cursed.
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>Could you take this jewelry to Gikaro?
Tell him that you're a soldier and you <cf>have to deal with these things properly</cf>.
Could you please deliver this green gem to <cf>Gikaro</cf> at Barnhart Castle?
Oh, adventurer! <cf> How was your sister, not <cf> your sister ......?
Eh?　The green jewel I gave you is <cf>cursed!
Oh no, ....... So I was the cause of the <cf>'strange things' that my sister was talking about?
Ugh ...... pathetic!
Oh, you brought the jewelry too, didn't you? <cf>Thank you for taking the trouble!
You're a ["]soldier, so you should <cf>deal with these things properly["]....... My sister is right.
They cover the buildings with plants. ...... <cf>That might help in some places.
Can we support abandoned buildings so they don't collapse, <cf>or even grow grass in wastelands?
I've thought about it and I think I can do something about it. <cf>I'll take care of this gem ...... no, I'll take care of it myself!
I'll try a few things, I'll try a few things. <cf>Maybe I can get more ideas if I talk to my superiors.
<cf>Thank you for your patience, adventurer. <cf>Thank you very much for your cooperation!
As for the green gems, <cf>we are discussing our response with the Knights as well!
As it happens, <cf>I was also praised for finding the gem!
I will <cf>keep up the good work so that my sister will not be worried!
Welcome! <cf>I've come up with another new bento for you.
<cf>I took a cue from the cold region's cuisine. <cf>I wanted to make a menu that would warm you up.
The main dish is <cf>"large onole chestnuts" from the West Barnhart Peninsula!
But you know what? <cf>I want to use them, but there's a problem.
We don't have them in the Asterlys store, and <cf>we don't know where to buy them</cf>.
It's a bit of an expensive vegetable, <cf>so it doesn't seem to sell very well.
That's why we put a lot of it in our lunches to make it more economical!
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>" for <cf>10 large Onor chestnuts!
Go and collect them in a jiffy. <cf>Thank you!
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>" and collect <cf>10 large onol chestnuts!
I'm trying to make a geeky lunch. <cf>Thanks for your help!
Oh, what a wonderful "large Honolulu chestnuts"! <cf>Thank you. <cf>Thank you.
<cf>When I steam them with seafood, they absorb the broth and taste so good!
<cf>The smell alone is enough to get everyone hooked! <cf>This should make a good lunch box.
<cf>I'm sure we can get some unusual ingredients if we ask you. <cf>I'll ask for your help again if I need anything else!
<cf>I'm sure you can find all kinds of interesting ingredients in Barnhart.
I'm getting interested in other places too. <cf>If you find any unusual ingredients, let me know!
I heard about it at ....... <cf>I hear you now have access to the Principality of Barnhart.
<cf>Thanks for making my job easier. Thank you.
Heeheehee....... <cf>And of course the making of the transformation potion. <cf>I have a material that I couldn't get before.
You know the Machina? <cf>I need the driving fluid used in that thing.
<cf>To be precise, it's 'the soil in which the driving fluid is sunk. <cf>When you mix it, you mix it with the soil anyway.
It's a pain in the ass to break the machina to get it, right? <cf> baboon ....... I'll hold off on the soil.
That and the 'rotten twisted shells' you can find on the beach. <cf>Look, the rotten ones, okay?
Fresh twisted clams make a good broth, but <cf>the rotten ones have other uses,<cf> baboon!
You can get them around <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>. <cf>Thanks for your help, baboon baboon baboon ......
Get me five "Driven Liquid Sinking Soil" and ten <cf>"Rotten Twisted Shells".
<cf>Look for "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>" on the West Barnhart Peninsula. Nice to meet you, baboon. ......
Did you find the material I asked for?　baboon......
Sinking soil with driving fluid" and "rotten twisted shells". <cf> Perfect, that's what I'm talking about.
Ah, a fragrant aroma. <cf> Sounds like a good concoction, baboon baboon baboon.
Thank you. <cf> Now I'm one step closer to making a makeover potion.
Hmm?　...... Oh, right. <cf>I didn't tell you why I make make makeover potions.
It's not to make money. <cf>With my skills, I can make a good living as a concoction maker.
Baboon....... Well, give me a break. <cf>Not that I'm trying to abuse it.
I'll let you know when it's finished. <cf>So help me out again. Nice to meet you, baboon......
Baboon....... <cf>If you could transform into anyone, what would you do?
Well, it would depend on who it was. <cf>I can imagine a lot of things, baboon......
......There are some people in the world who can't be saved with the right medicine. Baboon......
Oh, you. <cf>Thank you for all the help you give me.
I'm trying to recreate the manufacturing process of a 400 year old weapon, <cf> but there's so much I don't know.
Well, there's a lot I don't know. <cf>The way we do things nowadays is too different from the craft.
Instead, it seems like I can make <cf>quality weapons that are different<cf>from crafting.
One of the hints is a record of <cf>["fusion of ore and biological tissue["]"].
[Steel plates with the suppleness of muscle were <cf>actually made and used.
I don't know what it is, but as a blacksmith, I'm intrigued.
So. <cf>I looked around to see if I could at least find a sample.
You know the Machina of the Duchy of Barnhart? <cf>It seems an armored version of it is being built with the same idea in mind.
There should be a stray <cf>Machina Fox</cf> hanging around in <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>.
Would you <cf>pick up five armored samples of Makina?
And I'd also like to ask you for some ore called 'ice-piercing iron'. <cf>The iron in each land may have different properties.
I'd like to see both together. <cf>This will take a lot of time and effort, but please do it.
<cf>Please get me 5 samples of machina armor and 20 pieces of ice-piercing iron.
<cf>The "Machina Armor Samples" must be obtained by defeating the Machina Fox.
The "Ice Piercing Iron" can be found by collecting ore.
Both can be found at <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>" on the West Barnhart Peninsula.
Sorry for the hassle. <cf>Thank you.
Oh, Anta! <cf>You brought me the material I asked for.
<cf>I got the "Machina Armor Sample" and "Ice Piercing Iron". <cf>I certainly received them. Thanks a lot.
Now, let's see what's going on!
...... Hmm?　No, this could be. <cf>Are we supposed to look into Barnhardt's military secrets?
...... It's okay, maybe. <cf>It's a wild machina, and I'm just using it as a reference.
...... Can you keep it naira, just in case?
The armoring on the machina, the joints move well. <cf>But the metal itself is hard and solid.
It's a <cf>different impression from the ["]steel plate with the suppleness of muscles["]. ......
This is an interesting construction, but <cf>I guess there's another way to think about the 400 year old manufacturing process
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/> or ...... <cf>I didn't know such a ferocious lot would attack livestock.
They are a heavy load for a novice adventurer. <cf>There is no choice but for a veteran like me to take the plunge.
<cf>It's dangerous if someone says, <cf>"For the sake of the livestock," and then carelessly meddles with the livestock.
You are an adventurer too? I'm Guyler. <cf>I'm an adventurer based in Canaroa.
<cf>I've been doing this for a long time, even though I look like this. <cf>I guess you could say I'm a veteran.
<cf>You seem to be pretty good at it too. <cf>But I'm still as good as you. Hahaha!
Now, about this request. <cf>I'm afraid we're going to have a bit of a tricky opponent.
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>. You know? <cf>They're ferocious monsters that even a seasoned veteran like me would have a hard time dealing with.
I've heard they're herding together and attacking livestock.
They are a formidable opponent, but we can't just leave them alone. <cf>The damage is spreading little by little.
If someone says, "[It's] for the livestock[,]" and <cf>carelessly touches them, it's dangerous.
Let's go talk to the villagers first. <cf>I hope there is someone who knows about livestock: ......
Livestock are being affected by <value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>.
Let's go talk to the villagers. <cf>It would be helpful to have someone who knows about livestock.
Ah, the kind adventurer who <cf>helped</cf> me with the chickens and cows!
Now you're going to help us with the pig! <cf>Thank you!
And you? <cf>I don't think you're a resident of Canaroa: ......
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/> heard that you bullied Mr. Pig!
It's terrible!　It is unforgivable! <cf>This is truly the work of an animal that is no better than a pig!
I still think we need to take down Dire Howl.
I agree! <cf>Let's split up and take them down 20 at a time!
<cf>Twenty! <cf>Wait a minute. That's indeed the number: ......
Because they bullied the pigs, right? <cf>We must punish them!
It's nothing like 20 pigs! <cf>That tells me the line that must not be crossed!
<value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>...the...unforgivable!
Damn ......, I have no choice. <cf>I'll go with you, Elsie.
You manage to defeat 20 of them. <cf>If we take down that many, there should be no problem.
<cf>I'll take care of Elsie-kun. <cf>As a veteran adventurer, I will protect you!
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/> Let's take down 20 of them! <cf>Because it's for the pigs!
<value size="Big" type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/><span size="Big">They must not be allowed! </>
...... Oh, it's you. I see that you have successfully defeated <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>.
Twenty, huh? You did a good job. <cf>You are still very good at what you do. ......
Hey ....... Have you ever seen a "genius"? <cf>"The Real Thing"......
If I had to use a metaphor, I'd say yes. ......
While I finally beat one <value type="enemyName" id="E006_02_00_00000"/>, it's a bullwhip-wielding storm that turned <cf>19 of them into blood smoke and pieces of meat!
Ah, adventurers! <cf>Thank you for your hard work in defeating the Dire Howl!
Even the pigs were pleased. <cf>Adventurer, you are indeed strong!
My accumulated experience is nothing but an empty sand castle in front of the <cf>'real thing'......
I've learned my lesson. ...... <cf> that there are heights in the world that are out of reach.
Thank you, Gailer, for your help! <cf>Thanks for defeating just one of them!
Elsie, you. You are the 'real deal'! <cf>You deserve to be the head of Canaroa!
Show me your full strength as an adventurer!
Huh?　Ya.
<span size="Big">Why? </>
I know! <cf>Those reddened hands are the sign of a true strong man!
This is the blood of the pig you have just slaughtered! <cf>Don't talk about it like it's some strange thing!
<cf> I'm afraid to fight monsters! <cf>I definitely don't want to be an adventurer!
<cf>You've shown such ability, and yet you're still wary of monsters. ......
You are the 'real deal' after all! <cf>Adventurer among adventurers!
With everything I have, <cf>I will make you the best adventurer I can!
<cf>I'll make you the best adventurer I can! <cf>I am a butcher!
I will never be an adventurer!
<cf> I've lost track of you, Elsie. <cf>That's great.
I'll do whatever I can to persuade you, Elsie. <cf> With everything I have as a seasoned adventurer!
Ah ...... adventurer ....... Hello.
Thanks for your help in making the celebratory wedding soup. <cf>Remember me?　Thanks for that occasion.
I have a fiancée. <cf>We were going to get married when he comes back.
His name is Yoan, and he's an adventurer. <cf>I was in the Montenol valley for a commission. ......
...... The other day, a friend of Yoan's delivered<cf>his bandana to me.
A rather rough looking guy named Girsch. <cf>He kept apologizing over and over again.
Yoan defended Mr. Girsch and <cf>went into the crowd of monsters......
They found only the bandana, but <cf>Yoan's whereabouts are still unknown......
Adventurer, please. <cf>Please find Yoan!
I want to believe that he is safe. <cf>But if something goes wrong,......
...... whatever the outcome, <cf>I want to get my facts straight.
Maybe Litze can find someone who <cf>knows how to trace Yoan's steps.
Yoan was not only doing the work he was asked to do, but he was also <cf>helping and escorting the merchants.
That's why he always came home late. <cf>But I liked that about him.
...... not something to talk about in the past tense just yet. <cf>Adventurer. Please, please, please.
I need you to find an adventurer named Yoan. <cf>I think I know someone in Litze who knows where he's going.
I want to believe he is safe. ...... <cf>Please, Mr. Adventurer!
Oh, Mr. Adventurer! <cf>What can I do for you?
Are you looking for someone ......? <cf>Well, is your name Yoan?
Oh, by the way, I failed to ask your name. <cf>The other day, I met an adventurer in the mountains.
<cf>We were being attacked by a monster, and you saved us.
He seemed to be in a great hurry, <cf>and went deep into the mountains again.
Oh, yes! <cf> In return, I gave you a bandana.
<cf>I heard that he had lost the one he was using. <cf>I thought I could at least give you that.
<cf>I'm glad you're looking for it, Joanne! <cf>I can thank you properly later!
Joan said she was looking for something, so she went to <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>".
If you see him, please give him my best regards. <cf>The merchant was very grateful, and
The Joan you are looking for has gone to <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>".
He said he was looking for something important. <cf>I think he's still in the mountains.
Can we get to him from here: ......
...... hmm?　Who are you?
I'm sorry. I was looking for something. <cf> I didn't notice until you called out to me.
I'm Yoan. <cf>An adventurer, as you can see.
What, you were looking for me?
Well, Katya is ....... <cf>Sorry about that.
I'm always late getting home, <cf>so I neglected to contact you.
Of course I'd be worried if I only received a bandana. <cf>I feel bad for Girsch.
I know. I'll be home soon. <cf>But first, there's something I really need to do.
<cf>I need to get back the leather bag that was taken from me by the mooks around here.
I have to bring that one back. <cf>Mr. You, while you're at it, give me a hand.
I know who took the leather bag. <cf>But it's a tough crowd. We're having a hard time.
I need you to kick the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/> out of my men. <cf>15 of them, I'd appreciate it if you could take them out.
They will be disorganized and out of control. <cf>While you do that, I'll get the leather bag back from the head.
<cf>We'd better split up. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet up in Litze.
Thanks for your help. I'll see you later.
<cf>I've worried about Katya and Girsch. <cf>I'll bow to you properly when I get back.
But first, I really <cf>have to get back the leather bag that the Mooks took from me.
<cf><value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/><value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/>and take them down.
Meanwhile, I'll get the leather bag back from the mastermind. <cf>When you're done, we'll meet up at Litze.
Hey, I've been waiting for you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/>Thank you for killing them!
I got my leather bag back in one piece. <cf>Thanks to you for coming.
The contents are "Crescent Mushrooms". Do you know what they are? <cf>They're a rare mushroom that's almost impossible to find nowadays.
And they're an essential ingredient in the <cf>celebratory wedding soup</cf> that Katya's dead mother made.
It's a taste of irreplaceable memories for her. <cf>That's why I had to bring them back.
I was desperate because if I missed this one, I might never <cf>get it again.
But if I made you worry for it, there's no way I could take care of it. <cf>I need to get home and apologize.
You're going to report back to Katya, aren't you? <cf>Then I'll go with you.
<cf>Come along with me a little longer until we get back to Minsterhorn.
Let's go back to Katya. <cf>I've caused you to worry.
You'll be back to report too, won't you? <cf>Will you come with me to Minsterhorn?
Welcome back, adventurer!
And ......
Yoan!　It's Joan, isn't it? ...... <cf> Thank goodness ...... you're safe.
I'm sorry, Katya. <cf>I'm sorry I worried you.
It's ok. If you're back, ......
<cf>I'm glad you're back, thanks to this guy's help. <cf>I got this guy back from those mooks.
This ...... no way, crescent mushrooms!
I got lucky. <cf>I really wanted to get them to Katya.
A celebratory wedding soup. You said you'd be able to <cf>make it by the time I get back, right?
Yes, I did. I practiced a lot. <cf>That's exactly what this adventurer helped me do.
Excuse me?
Well, even Katya took care of you. ...... <cf> I can't thank you enough for what you did for us.
You owe us both. <cf>It was a real pleasure meeting you.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>We all owe you a lot.
If you ever stop by Minsterhorn,<cf> just drop in anytime.
I'll treat you to an eye-opening feast of delicious food. <cf>You're more than welcome!
Thank you so much. <cf>You owe me and Katya a lot.
I apologized to that Girsch guy too. <cf>He was crying like a baby.
It's not good to worry about the people you care about. <cf>I'm sure you'll be fine, but don't do anything rash.
That is why I have been pursuing a certain person for many years. <cf>The one to whom I must fulfill my innermost wish: ......
<cf>I have prepared a "proof" with all my heart and soul. <cf>All I have to do now is to confront him with my long-cherished desire!
Wait and see......!　I will not let you escape. ......
Oh, you are a skilled adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your help the other day.
<cf> for your efforts to create a "testament" to my heart.
Thanks to you, I was able to give form to a "testament" that I am not ashamed of. <cf>I am truly grateful
There is someone with whom I must settle the matter.
This "proof" is what will let that person know <cf>my will.
This is the great victory of a lifetime! <cf> I beg you to stand in my presence.
And one more thing. <cf>I'm sorry to trouble you, but could you please bring him here?
I have my own obsession: ....... <cf>I would like to sharpen my mind before I meet him face to face.
 <cf>["]I have business in Khartoum["], he said.
I entrust you with a letter from him. <cf>Please do me the favor.
......Well, here we are at last. <cf>You will not escape me now, Durga. ......
<cf>There must be an adventurer named Durga in the Khartoum Ruins.
He is the one to whom I must fulfill my destiny. <cf>I am sorry, but I must ask you to bring him here.
I would like to sharpen my mind ....... <cf>I will let you go no longer, Durga. ......
Hmm?　What is it, you? <cf>Luke sent you a message?
You went to the trouble of sending me a letter. <cf>Thank you. Let's see... ......
<cf>"Dear Mr. Durga. <cf>I would like to settle our relationship.
<cf>"Fair and square, one on one. <cf> "This is the game of my life, the game of my life.
"<cf>Don't ever, ever run away from me. <cf> I beg you not to disappoint me."
--What do you mean, ......? <cf>What the hell is this guy up to?
He's Ryuk's ......! <cf>He sent me a letter of fulfillment!
Fine, I'll take it. ...... <cf>I'll take it!
Let's settle this, you know, settle it! <cf>I'll tell you who you've got a fight with!
<cf>I'll tell you who I picked a fight with! <cf>Who won, me or Ryuk?
Come on, let's go to Salamzat! <cf> Ryuk, you wait and see!
Ryuk! <cf>You've got some nerve to pick a fight with me!
[You want to settle this? <cf>I want it to be over!
You'll see! <cf>Come on, let's go to Salamzat!
Come on, ...... Durga!
Ryuk!　Your destiny ends today, doesn't it?
Durga. You are the first warrior I've ever been willing to trust my back to. ......
Yeah, me too. <cf>I still liked you.
<cf>With you, we can overcome any hardship.
I agree. You and I have no enemies. <cf>I thought so. ......
I swear that I will have your back for the rest of my life!
I believed in you!
Please be my companion and <cf>walk the path of the warrior with me!
So why do I have to fight ......?
Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute.
What are you talking about? <cf> Ryuk, what happened to the fight?
You've been talking about it with a lot of fervor ...... since a while ago. <cf>It's like that ...... proposal!
What else could it be? <cf>I don't know anything about a fight.
<cf>Take this sword. <cf>This is the token of the oath I made.
...... Isn't it a ring?　In such a case...
It was indeed made of the material of a ring, but I broke it. <cf>So I made it part of the handle by force.
It's not impossible to remove, but ....... <cf>It's not strong enough to protect your finger, okay?
............ pff ......! <cf>Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
Hahaha ...... funny! <cf>Anta, you're really a man of your own pace!
I can't help it. I'll take it ......
Oh oh oh ...... Durga!
I couldn't be happier! <cf>This is the best day of my life!
Dear adventurer!　I am sorry! <cf>You have seen to it that my oath is fulfilled!
I cannot thank you enough, Ryuk! <cf> You will be my friend for life!
<cf>I am sorry for the trouble I have caused you. <cf>I thank you as well. <cf>Thank you.
<cf> I'm not a bad guy, even if I am a bit of a jerk. <cf>Take care of my husband again!
Hey, adventurer!　Is everything alright? <cf> I'm glad to hear you're all right.
My wife, Durga, sends her regards.
<cf>We both wish you well in your future endeavors!
Hey, hey, ...... what a mediocre blueprint! <cf>Are you asking me to carve these boring stone statues?
Should we follow the client here? <cf>No, my soul doesn't want that!
<cf> Seek the wild! <cf>Feel the shout that comes from my soul!
I'm glad you're here! <cf>I am Aurelie, the wild soul sculptor!
I was commissioned by the Duchy of Barnhart to <cf>create</cf> a statue of a knight!
<span size="Big">Oooooohhhh, I'm on fire! </>
Inspiration is already coming! <cf>I can't think of anyone else who can live up to my soul!
I saw a rockin' monster at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>! <cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>"<cf>"<value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>" The Crab Spider!
He uses his scissors to decorate the knight statue! <cf> This guy is going to be a revolutionary masterpiece!
I was thinking ....... <cf>The guy in charge told me no.
<cf>Don't do anything unnecessary and make it according to these boring blueprints!
The prestige of the Order of Barnhardt, <cf> tradition and prestige, ......
<span size="Big">Shut up! </>
I'm not giving up! <cf>I'm going to convince that old man!
<span>I'm going to ask you to do some normal material gathering for now. <cf>I'll need rocks as well as scissors.
<cf>Gather up some angular gray marble from <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>.
Come back here when you're done. <cf>In the meantime, I'll convince the old man in charge!
Hang on, old man! <cf>I'll draw out the shouts of your soul!
<cf>In the meantime, I'm gonna go talk some sense into the old man in charge! <cf>When you're done, come back here again!
After that, I'll be waiting for you! <cf>I'll get the <value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/> scissors!
Oh, good job! <cf>"Angular gray marble". Thanks!
Just give me a minute. <cf>I called the guy in charge!
How's it going, old man? <cf>We've got some good stones here. All that's left is to make a decision!
Hmmm, but... ......
You're really happy with these blueprints! <cf>Does it convey the greatness of the Order of Barnhardt?
I don't think so, man. <cf>Your power is ...... soul is not like this!
The soul of Barnhart is much greater and hotter than this! <cf>The dragon tribe will be blown to the ends of the sky!
Mhmm!　It is indeed true!
The pride, dignity, and passion of our Order! <cf> That's not something that can be fully expressed in words!
Then let's express it all! <cf>That would be aggravating and awesome, wouldn't it?
Of course, if you can do that, great! <cf> Can you do it, Aurelie?
It's not a question of whether or not you can do it, it's a question of <span size="Big">doing it! </>
Let your souls be on fire!　Scream! <cf>Let's put it all in the knight statue!
<span size="Big">Oooooh!　<span size="Big">Whoah! </>
Let the roar of our souls <cf>be heard in every corner of the Principality of Barnhardt!
We've got a deal! <cf>We'll make the most soulful knightly image we can!
All I need is a pair of wild crab claws! <cf>Get them by killing <value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>!
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_03_01_00000"/>" should be in <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>! <cf>Please do, adventurers who know the wild spirit!
<cf>We are the rockin' crab spiders of <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>! <cf>We're sure our wild spirits will be rewarded!
I see you got your "wild crab scissors"! <cf>Thanks, man!
Wow!　They're really wild up close! <cf>I'm so excited!
I see! <cf>This wild pair of scissors makes me proud to be a knight......
...... a little too flashy, don't you think?
It's too late for that now! <cf>Now that I'm in front of the crab scissors, nothing can stop me!
Trust me, old man! <cf>I promise I will make you the best knight!
Yes, I do! <cf>We confirmed each other's soul shouts!
Aurelie! <cf>I'll leave you to it, no problem!
...... no problem, right? <cf>You're not going to get mad at me up there, are you?
<cf>I'm going to start working on the knight statue! <cf>Thanks to you!　Thanks wildly!
<span size="Big">Come on, let's carve, carve, carve! </>
Hoo ...... another masterpiece of my soul has been born!
Shouting knight wearing a crab-snout helmet. <cf> So wild, it's making me sit up!
Don't worry, I'll be fine! <cf>The next new product will do well!
Where does that confidence always come from ....... <cf>You're not going to make something weird again?
It's not weird! <cf>Speak of individuality and originality!
Yay, adventurer! <cf>Welcome to inventors Anne & Shea's new product development!
I'm just getting involved. <cf>Don't say it like we're masterminds together!
<cf>Thank you for the poisoned accessories. Mr. Adventurer.
How to say!　I didn't poison the <cf>accessory</cf> just because I used Venomine!
If you sold it to the assassin, it <cf>might</cf> have worked, Anne.
Oh, I see. <cf>Shea, that's what I'm talking about!　You've got a good eye for detail!
I don't even listen to sarcasm. ......
So, here's a new product for you today!
Salamzaat is very dry, isn't it? <cf>Your skin gets chapped easily too!
So I'm thinking of making a hand cream. <cf>I've already thought of a catchphrase.
<cf>"An instant oasis for desert skin!" <cf>I think it will definitely sell!
It's a very straight forward idea for Anne. <cf>Do you have an atte for good material?
for ......?
Cohon, I'm glad you asked! <cf>I've got my eye on a creature of the desert.
Its name is <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>!
It's been in the desert all its life, but its body hair is shiny! <cf>It must have some kind of drying-resistance in its fur!
What?　No, <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>'s hair is ......
So, collect the <cf>"bristles that withstand dryness" in "<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>"!
Because if you defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>, you <cf>should</cf> be able to get it!
After all, you're messing with monsters. ......
Sorry, adventurer. <cf>Five "bristles that withstand dryness," please.
<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/> for the <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>.
You should be able to get "bristles that endure dryness", so please collect about <cf>5 of them!
I am sorry for the trouble Anne has caused you. <cf>She's so reckless right away. ......
Ah, adventurer, you're back! <cf>Did you get the "bristles that endure dryness"?
You got it all together as requested. <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
Now you can make hand cream! <cf>We'll market it under the Anne & Shea brand...
If you cut it into small pieces, grind it up, and extract the <cf>fatty ingredients,<cf> you can get it at ......
...... that?　<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>'s hair is stiff. <cf> Rough or ...... rugged?
There are a lot of their natural enemies in the desert. <cf>They've evolved hard body hair to protect themselves.
If you use a bad blade or blunt instrument, <cf>you'll ruin your tools.
In the past, they even processed these hairs to make armor.
No, no, no, no matter how hard it is, it's still hair, okay? <cf>It's easy to make something like this ......kku......ugi_nunu_nunu_nunu_nunu_nunu......
Nugu...... ugi......<span size="Big">Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! </>
Yuck, it doesn't bend at all. <cf>What, am I holding an iron rod?
Adventurer. Thank you <cf> for being so selfish Anne!
I don't think the idea was bad, but <cf>the way you did it was still Anne's.
I'll tell him to make <cf>ordinary products</cf> out of plant and livestock oil.
In this case, I'll use the last resort! <cf>I guess I could chew it!　Gulp!
Hey ...... what are you doing, Anne! <cf>Give it out!　It's dirty and dangerous!
Some monsters <cf>eat</cf> <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>, so there's nothing you can't chew through!
You wouldn't eat <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>! <cf>Here, petch it!　Petch!
Fuggiigigi......! <cf>It's creaking ...... a little bit ......!　My chin.
My face is changing shape! <cf>Anne!　Open your mouth ...... hey ......!
<span size="Big">Stop,...... stop it! </>
You can't chew through <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>'s hair with human power. <cf>Then let the sand vipers do it!
You want to be swallowed whole!
Don't worry!　I'm just asking for a little help!
Come to your senses, Anne! <cf> Stop it! ...... Stop it!
<cf>Where is my Yee-chan~? <cf>Where is our Yee-chan~?
...... They couldn't answer me. <cf>Ah, I'm so tired~!
<cf>Wait a minute, Yi-chan~! <cf>Come out and I'll give you an engram~!
...... Kyu~......
<cf>Yee is flipping over after running out of engrams!
......Yi~......
He fell into the water and just drifted away......
Maybe there is someone out there looking for it. <cf>If I know of anyone, I'll let you know.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Have you seen an upturned ee-chan?
I'm looking for Ee-chan for some reason. <cf> I haven't found him at all, and I'm feeling sluggish.
Have you seen ......?　I did~! <cf>Finally found a clue!
Thank you. <cf>While you're at it, could you take care of one thing for me?
I'm sorry. <cf> I'm sorry to ask you to do something so lame.
<cf>My master has a lot of Buffalian heritage in his villa.
And for its stable operation, <cf>he has a lot of ee-chan, too!
There are also a lot of cats, dogs, nappies, and <cf>everything else.
Rich people don't know how to add or subtract. <cf>I wish you knew how frustrating it is for those who manage them.
Oh, sorry. <cf>I was too lazy to say anything.
<cf>They went out of the house.
They probably ran out of engrams there and <cf>didn't come back.
When they run out of engrams, they turn over and can't move.
Isn't that what humans do when they're tired? <cf>It's no different for Ee-chan.
That's why we have to <cf>recover</cf> E-chan.
If you see an upside-down Yi-chan in town, <cf>could you catch it and bring it to me?
There are several of them, but <cf>please find one for now!
They don't go out into the desert, so <cf>if you can find one in Salamzat, that's fine.
I'll search nearby too, please. <cf>I'm really tired of this~!
I'm sure there is a <cf>turned-over Ee-chan</cf> somewhere in Salamzert.
I'm sure it's our Ee-chan, so <cf>could you please retrieve it and bring it here?
I'm so tired of this cat thing! <cf>I'm sorry. I'll be counting on you.
I found the overturned Yee.
No response when I poked him. <cf>I think he's running out of engrams.
I'll get it to Tini.
Ahhh, thank you for your help. <cf> Did you find Yee there, too?
Was it turned upside down? <cf>That's exactly what I'm talking about, that.
Which is ....... Yes, it's the same as the one over here. <cf>I guess I'm still out of engrams.
Thank you. <cf>By the looks of it, it doesn't seem to be broken anywhere.
<cf>Well, then, I'm sorry, but could you please look for the other Ee-chan?
I think they are very curious, and <cf> they go into strange places.
Behind a rock, under a table, etc.... <cf>Behind the tent...... No, I suspect the top of the tent.
I'll keep an eye on Ee here. <cf>I'd be lazy if he woke up suddenly and went somewhere else.
If I can adjust well, <cf>I might be able to get her back to the mansion on her own.
I'm sorry, but I'm counting on you.
I'm sure there are still some Yee's in <cf>Salamuzaat</cf> that have run out of engrams.
On top of tents, under tables, etc. <cf>I'm sure they are in strange places, so please find them!
I'll try to fix them here. <cf>Sorry, but I'd appreciate it.
I found some broken ee of engrams.
Once I recover all of them, I'll deliver them to Tini.
Wow, adventurer. Thank you. <cf>You all found it for me.
It's really helpful. I really appreciate it. <cf>I would have been really tired without you adventurers!
Hinomimi ......? <cf>Are we missing one more?
Ah~, that's her! <cf>Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Adventurer, did you get a chance to see her in the water?
There's Ee-chan, who loves to go in the water. <cf>Of course, she can't swim, so she sinks!
...... The first ko you saw fell into the water and drifted away? <cf> Ah, that's it. No doubt about it.
Excuse me, but could you <cf>please go retrieve the last one?
I can't just leave it in the oasis. <cf>I'm really tired of this!
I think there is one more Yee-chan out there, <cf>could you please retrieve it for me?
She can't swim, but she likes to go in the water, so <cf>I think she's sunk in the oasis.
I have to wipe the water off, it's so tiring~! <cf>No, if I leave it alone, will it dry up?
I found ee sinking to the bottom of the oasis. <cf>She looks mindlessly content.
Let's retrieve it and deliver it to Tini.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer. <cf> Did you find the last ee?
Ahhhhh, it's soaked through beautifully!
Was it sunk in the oasis after all? <cf>You're so dynamic at your own pace!
I'm sure this little Yee will be a big shot in the future. <cf> But I hope it will be somewhere that has nothing to do with me.
Anyway, thank you very much. <cf>I've got it all here with this little guy.
Oh, it was so tiring. I'm already sweating. <cf>I feel like taking a dip in an oasis too!
I guess I'll go home then. <cf>By the way, Ee-chan is surprisingly big, isn't it?
How shall I take it home with me? ...... <cf>Ha, geez. I'm tired just thinking about it~!
By the way, isn't it <cf>too hot in this town?
Master, can't you supply us with summer clothes or something~?
Special training is underway to strengthen the security forces!
It's too lukewarm for the troops to fight each other. <cf>Throw them into the dungeon for hands-on training against monsters!
I feel like it's too late to come back. ...... <cf>Well, you'll be fine!
Oh, it's you! <cf>You've come to the right place.
<cf>I've been training my men of the guard to follow your example.
<cf> They are training hard against monsters in the dungeon! <cf> Our goal is to kill 1,000 monsters per man!
<cf> We're trying to protect this big city. <cf>You've got to be able to do that!
...... and I was thinking...
<cf>I've got a rookie who's been isolated in the danger zone. <cf> I'm sorry to tell you this, but someone needed rescuing.
<cf>Well, you're on your own. <cf>But if I don't help him, my men will die.
That's why I'm asking you to help me rescue them.
The place is the "Water Spirit's Dance Hall. <cf>You go on a rampage and attract the monsters!
Be so fierce that you can even knock out the bad guy at the far end!
<cf>In the meantime, we'll rescue your men. <cf>You can leave everything to us.
<cf>Thank you for your time. <cf>Thank you for your help!
<cf>Then, please take care of them!
In the meantime, rescue your men who have become isolated. <cf>Thank you for the trouble you've put me through!　I'm counting on you!
Hey, good job! <cf>Thanks for running wild!
<cf>Thanks for rescuing my men. <cf>Don't worry. I'm fine.
That's right. ...... <cf>They can still afford it.
You ain't pushing hard enough, are you? <cf>Don't you think so too?　Don't you think so?
Damn, what I did. <cf>I was too quick to help you out, man.
Well, whatever! <cf> You're a real piece of work after all.
You gonna join the guard now? <cf>You're always welcome!
<cf>When you're ready, let me know. <cf>Let's work through those bean sprouts together!
It's not a good idea to have people in need of rescue during training, is it?
It's not right to rely on rescues in the first place. <cf>You just have to do something about it yourself.
That's right!　Okay! <cf>Next time we're going to train, we're not going to get rescued, even if we get lost!
I got to open the store I've always wanted. <cf>Come on, let's grow my brand!
Watch me! <cf>Asterleaze, the city of fashion!
Hey there, adventurer. Welcome!
I've opened the brand store I've always wanted. <cf>Thanks to you adventurers for your help!
<cf>Thanks to you, the store is doing great. <cf>But we're not satisfied yet!
Our goal is to be the best brand in the world! <cf>To do that, we need to raise our profile.
<cf>That's why we've set our sights on an upcoming fashion contest.
It's called the "Trima Awards". <cf>It's a contest sponsored by a certain baron.
It's famous as a gateway to success for new designers. <cf>Many brands have made a name for themselves after winning.
<cf>This time, I'm going to be the winner of the grand prize!
Of course, it's not easy to win. <cf>I have to make the best dress and take on the challenge!
So, please bear with me until the dress is finished!
<cf>I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do. <cf>I'm going to incorporate the Barnhart style and push for exoticism.
I need you to gather the materials needed for the dress. <cf>I want to make sure they come from Bernhardt, too.
First, "fossilized peach coral," which yields an elegant dye. <cf>You should be able to find it at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>.
And then there is "harte cotton," a supple, luxurious cotton. <cf>This one should be collected with "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>".
Actually, I'm having a hard time deciding on the last one: ....... <cf> Anyway, bring me those two first.
Once you actually see the materials, you'll get some inspiration! <cf>Please bring me some good materials for inspiration!
<cf>First of all, please bring me two pieces of material. <cf>Both can be found on the West Barnhart Peninsula.
Fossilized Peach Coral can be found by <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>collecting the <cf>mineral</value>.
Hartt cotton" is "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>. <cf>This one should be available by collecting plants.
Because you can find good quality ones. <cf>We'll look forward to it!
Thanks for your time! <cf>You've been gathering materials for me.
Yeah, nice "peach coral fossil"! <cf>It's a prettier pink than I expected.
<cf>The "Hartt Cotton" is great too! <cf>So soft and soothing to the touch!
It's good. Very nice! <cf>Here it comes, here comes the inspiration!
I've got an idea, the final touch! <cf>Let's use "large flint stones"!
<cf>The flint is a common stone used in jewelry. <cf>The bright red glow is so beautiful!
However, if the stone is too large, the color will be too strong, making it difficult to use.
But with my dress, I can make the most of it! <cf>You'll get a one-of-a-kind sparkle!
<cf>The intense red of "large flashing red stones" on a pale pink base. <cf>It's sure to look great!
Okay, let's get to the finishing touches! <cf>You go find the "Large Sparkling Red Stone"!
<cf>You can find it at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/> on the West Barnhart Peninsula. Please do!
The "large flint" can be found at <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/> in the West Barnhart Peninsula.
That's the final deciding factor for the dress. <cf>Thank you!
I'm glad you found the "large flintstone". <cf>Thank you!
Yes, it's very nice!　Perfect!
I'm so glad I asked you! <cf>You're not the only one with a good eye!
<cf>Now I'm all set. <cf>All I have to do now is put all my skills into it!
Wait and see, Trima Award!
I know the competition will be tough. <cf>There are talented designers from all over the world.
But my best work will definitely win! <cf>You helped me. I won't lose!
I'm going to bring a breath of fresh air to the fashion world, <cf>and I'm going to steal all the awards and all the buzz!
<cf>Making dresses for the Trima Awards is going well.
<cf>I'm going to win the grand prize for sure! <cf>It's the first step for my brand to shine!
The water in the oasis is <cf> the lifeline for the people of Salamzat.
I'll have to check it every day like this. <cf>If there is an anomaly, we need to take action immediately.
Thanks for taking on this request. <cf>I am the one who manages this oasis.
In fact, there has been a strange smell in the oasis since the other day. <cf> It's very slight, though, and no real harm has been done yet.
It appears to be a monster smell. <cf>The same thing has happened before.
That time, the monster's bodily fluids got mixed in with the water, <cf>causing quite a commotion.
The water is still safe to use. <cf>But if it gets any dirtier, we'll have a problem.
We want to get a handle on it before that happens.
I've looked into the cause of the problem with the previous disturbances. <cf>It's an old oasis in the "Khartoum Ruins".
It's connected to this place through a water vein deep underground.
If the water at the ruins gets polluted, <cf>this oasis will be affected as well.
I am going to go to the Khartoum Ruins to survey the old oasis and preserve the environment.
I need your help with that.
The old oasis is located near the <cf>Kaltoum Sandstone Corridor</cf>.
The monsters there are an obstacle to our work. <cf>They seem to be more active these days.
I wonder if you could do an "Additional Survey of the Kartoum Sandstone Corridor" to <cf>wipe out the monsters.
In the meantime, I'll clean up the oasis too. <cf>If all goes well, come back here.
I'd like you to do the "Cartoum Sandstone Corridor, Additional Survey" and <cf>clean up the monsters.
In the meantime, I'll be preserving the oasis. <cf>When you're done, come back here again.
Hey there. <cf>How was the "Cartoum Sandstone Corridor"?
Hmmm ...... was it still full of monsters? <cf>It was a good decision to hire you.
It made my work a lot easier. <cf>This oasis is back to normal. Thank you.
The old oasis was in terrible shape. <cf>The overabundance of monsters must have ravaged it.
And since I've been hearing about Avaritia, <cf>the monsters in the desert seem to have increased as well.
This will be fine for the time being. <cf>Let's think of some measures to prepare for the future.
Oasis is the life of the city, and it is my pride to keep it safe. <cf>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for protecting both of them.
Inspection results show no abnormalities. <cf>The water at the oasis is perfect today.
You may go and quench your thirst as well. <cf>Traveling in the desert must be tough, right?
The Coin Pavilion is so cozy~!
It's a great place to hang out with friends. <cf>A place like that is rare and precious, don't you think?
Yo, adventurer. <cf>I have a favor to ask you.
<cf>We've got a few hangouts here and there amongst our friends. <cf>The Coin Pavilion is one of them.
<cf>The hangout at Barnhart's is one of them. <cf>It's a little bit out of order right now.
There are monsters wandering around, and <cf>I can't get in.
It's a secret hideout, <cf>so I don't want to make too big a fuss.
So, we're looking for adventurers to help us out and take down the monsters.
We don't have any problem asking an adventurer to do it.
Why? <cf> Well, you can find out by asking him where his hideout is.
...... Please keep this between us.
<cf>"Alston Abandoned Mine". <cf>It's in "The Castle of Loneliness", you know it, right?
At the back of that abandoned mine. <cf>A little lock-up is our hideout.
Oops, I don't want to go any further! <cf>I'm sorry, but you'll have to guess the rest.
<cf>I'm sorry, but you'll just have to guess the rest. <cf>I don't feel like I can ask just anyone to do this job.
<cf>That's why I'm here! <cf>Clean out the Alston Mine
<cf>Go deep into the abandoned mine at Alston and clear out all the monsters.
I'm not asking anyone to do that. <cf>You know what I mean?　I'm feeling pretty damn good about this.
I'm in on it too. <cf>Well, don't take this any further.
Oh, that was fast! <cf>Thank you, thank you, thank you!
<cf>Thank you, thank you, thank you! <cf>Thanks to you, the "Alston Abandoned Mine" is now safe!
Now we can use it as a safe house again.
My master would say things like, "[You] don't have to go that far," or something like that.
I can't leave the monsters alone, can I?　I know, right? <cf>What if they get hurt?
<cf>I wish you'd think a little bit about the people around you who are paying attention to that kind of thing!
Well, well, thanks anyway! <cf>I'll be sure to let our master know.
<cf>Well then, I hope you will continue to patronize Coin-tei! <cf>Whenever you're free, you should come visit us at the castle.
<cf>But you're a rough man, too, Master. <cf>I do a lot more work than you think.
<cf>Maybe I'll see you and the adventurer again sometime. <cf>When you do, I'll be counting on you.
That's funny. ...... <cf>I thought I put it in the back of my bag.
I must have dropped it somewhere. ...... <cf>What should I do?
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>I don't know what to do. ......
I came to Litze to <cf>repair</cf> my grandmother's precious jewelry box!
The stones used are rare and <cf>the store in Asterlys can't fix them.
Because my grandmother has not been well lately. <cf>I want to make her happy by cleaning her jewelry box.
But I think I dropped the all-important jewelry box <cf>somewhere. ......
I was startled by a monster near the village and fell down, so <cf>I think that's when I dropped it.
Please. <cf>Please find "Grandma's Jewelry Box"!
It should be somewhere in <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>!
That jewelry box is filled with <cf>memories</cf> of your dead grandfather.
If I lost it, I wouldn't be able to <cf>cheer up my grandma ......
I'm really sorry, but I'd appreciate it if you could help me!
I think "Grandma's Jewel Box" is somewhere in <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>"
It is very important. <cf>Please help me find it. Please!
I found <cf>"Grandma's Jewelry Box" that Clarissa said she lost.
It is old, but very carefully cared for. <cf>It looks like it was used with great care for a long time.
I'll deliver it to Clarissa in Litze.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer! <cf> Thank goodness you found it!
It's definitely "Grandma's Jewelry Box". <cf>I'm so glad: ......
I see you found it safe and sound. <cf>First of all, what a relief!
While the adventurers were looking for it, <cf>I talked to a craftsman in Litze.
I did, and he <cf>introduced me to Mr. Gullickson here.
I knew I'd heard the young lady's story before. <cf>I decided to take a look at that box once.
......How, I see. <cf>This guy's using a stone I've missed.
It's a "sunset-colored fluorite. <cf>You can't get this in Asterlys.
Can you repair it? <cf>It was my grandmother's prized possession.
I'll need a new "sunset-colored fluorite. <cf>But the tunnel where this stone was extracted has already been destroyed.
Such ......! <cf>Can't you do something about it?
Yes, ....... <cf>"<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>" is a possibility.
Originally, "sunset-colored fluorite" was <cf>collected in the southern part of the Montenol valley.
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>" has not been accessible for a long time. <cf>Maybe they're still lying around.
Really? ......!
However, there are a lot of monsters there. <cf>We'll have to ask the adventurers.
You, can't you lend a hand?
Adventurer, please. <cf>I really want to make my grandmother smile!
<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/> Please help me find <cf>"sunset-colored fluorite".
Please, please, please, please, please ......!
I really <cf>want</cf> to fix my grandmother's jewelry box: ......
I'm sorry. <cf>Please, please, please, please!
Adventurer! <cf>Thank you so much!　Really!
Oh, "sunset-colored fluorite". <cf>The quality and quantity are fine. That's quite a feat.
<cf>I'll take care of the rest. <cf>I will repair it properly.
I can't thank the adventurer enough. <cf>Mr. Gullickson, please take care of us too.
<cf>You said it was a memento of your dead grandfather.
It's not my own, miss. <cf>I'll tell you a good story.
Sunset-colored fluorite was once a popular gift for lovers.
<cf>They were given to lovers against the backdrop of a setting sun. <cf>The sun may set, but the sunset-colored light will never fade.
The beautiful memory of this day <cf>will shine forever ......
This jewelry box must have been a gift from an old man to an old woman when he <cf>confessed</cf> to her.
I'm sure <cf>the old lady will feel better when she sees the jewelry restored to the light of olden days!
I can't believe it was that important. ...... <cf>It's going to be restored. I'm so glad.
I've heard some wonderful stories, and <cf>I can't thank you enough!
Thank you so much, Adventurer!
Grandma and Grandpa's <cf>jewelry box of memories. It's so romantic, isn't it?
I can't wait to show it to my grandma. <cf>I'm sure this will cheer her up.
Woo, not good. <cf>My parents' finances are in a pinch......
You shouldn't make expensive purchases without thinking. <cf>He's right, craftsmen idiots don't have a good sense of finances!
Sorry, I'm talking about my family. <cf> Oh, my God, what are we going to do?
Adventurer~. <cf>Will you help my family?
I'm the daughter of a blacksmith heiress. <cf>That's okay, but my parents' house is in big trouble. ......
You bought a new furnace because it looked cool, <cf>without thinking twice. It's expensive.
<cf>Oh, my dad is a craftsman idiot, he has a funny sense of money! <cf>Oh, you're talking about my dad!
Anyway, my wallet is in trouble! <cf>We need to hit the jackpot and turn things around!
<cf>The new furnace is actually quite good. <cf>We were surprised that we could make good armor plate.
So I decided to sell this thing with a bang!
Our goal is to be officially adopted by the Order of Barnhardt! <cf>If your country backs it, the problem is solved!
<cf>To do that, I want to finish the prototype properly first.
In order for the Knights of Barnhart to use it, it must be able to be used on Machina.
However, without a proper study of the actual product, I'm not sure <cf>how it should be made.
So, I need you to pick up some armor for the Machina.
Someone saw a fight between a <cf>bandit and a machina in a <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>before.
It was a while ago, so something must still be down. <cf>"Cracked Machina armored plate" please!
Try <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>" to find <cf>"Cracked Machina Armor Plates"!
We're going to make a good prototype, and then <cf>the Barnhardt Knights are going to officially adopt it!
Oh, adventurer! <cf> "Cracked Machina Armor Plate", have you found it?
Hohoho, so this is it! <cf> A valuable source of judgment!　I'll take a look at it right away.
Hmmm... ...... Hohoho! <cf>This is another mysterious processing technique: ......
Hmmm, amazing!　Flexibility and strength at the same time! <cf>That's what a military nation is all about!
<cf>It seems we have a strong rival on the road to official adoption. ......
...... but the construction of this part. <cf>They are sacrificed for the sake of joint operation.
If you can improve this part, maybe ....... <cf>If we can use that ore and work out the mixing ratio, ......
Our furnace could do it. ...... <cf>Yeah, I think I might be seeing the light!
Adventurer. <cf>I have something I want you to look for in "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>"
'Solitary Black Ray Ore'. <cf>It's an ore we don't usually use and it's not in circulation.
But I think our furnace will work well with it. <cf>Please help me avoid a life of debt!
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>" and try to mine the ore. <cf>What I want is "Solitary Black Ray Ore".
We should be able to make a prototype with that thing. <cf>To avoid our debt, please!
<cf>Thank you! <cf>We can make a prototype armored plate with it.
According to my calculations, it can maintain both flexibility and strength. <cf>That said, it should be possible to process it without impeding movement!
With the new furnace, we can make it happen! <cf>Dad's waste of money does come in handy once in a while.
I'll make a prototype with it and try to sell it. <cf>Maybe we can do something about our family's financial crisis!
Thanks to you adventurers, we'll be able to move forward! <cf>Thank you so much!
I've tried pitching it to the Barnhart Knights. <cf>But they are slow to reply~!
What if Dad buys something weird again? <cf>Hurry, hurry!　I can't wait to be officially adopted~!
<cf>In Barnhart, knighthoods are given to those who have distinguished themselves outside of battle.
<cf>And they are also allowed to go to the castle. <cf>Well, this is a very interesting thing.
Ya-ya-ya, thank you very much. Adventurer. <cf>I was having trouble finding someone to help me at the castle.
My name is Rius, a farm knight. <cf>Please make my acquaintance.
It's an ostentatious title, though. <cf>In short, I am the farmer who produced the most crops in the country.
I heard that the old kings thought it would be a good idea to honor the achievements of the common people. <cf>Well, that's very kind of you.
<cf>I'm trying to be useful in my own way, yes, to at least live up to the title.
<cf>And then I heard that a farmer was in trouble. <cf>That's why I flew over.
<cf>I heard that their harvest had dropped considerably. <cf>When I investigated the cause, I found it was the monsters and the soil.
We needed materials to deal with each of them. <cf>I would like to ask adventurers to help us.
First, please go to <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/> and look for the <cf>"shiny grass fiber".
I often use it to keep birds away because it glitters, but <cf>it also works on wild animals.
Little goats and such can be chased away with it. <cf>For now, let's take care of that first.
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/> Could you please collect <cf>"fibers of glowing grass" at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>?
We have a soil problem, but <cf>first we'll keep the monsters away from the fields.
I think I will make one more request later. <cf>First of all, could you please give me some "fibers of glowing grass"?
Oh, adventurer. Thank you very much. <cf>"Fiber of Glowing Grass".
Well, it's a nice sparkling thing. <cf>This glitter works!
It drives away monsters and animals. <cf>It also keeps the crops from being eaten.
And there's another problem. <cf>The soil in the fields is getting tired.
I thought it would be good to nourish and revitalize it.
This time, please use "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". <cf>Pick me some "Namiuchi Lily Flowers".
It takes a little time and effort to remove the salt and dry them, but <cf>they make a good old-fashioned fertilizer!
<cf>They are an old-fashioned good-luck charm. <cf>There is a spell to bury them in the field.
<cf>Well, I bow down to our ancestors, don't I? <cf>Customs have meaning.
Other fertilizers are too strong for the tired land. <cf>"The Flower of the Lily of the Valley," please.
<cf>"Flowers of the Japanese Lily" can be found at <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>.
It used to be used a lot, but <cf>I don't see it much these days.
This is the best way to improve the soil. <cf>"Lily of the valley flower", please.
Wow, that's a magnificent flower of the Japanese snowy lily! <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
Monsters and soil. <cf>Both problems will be solved with this.
<cf>The farmers in this region are having a hard time. <cf>This climate, right?　Cold, dry.
So much of the land has been rendered useless by the wars.
Nowadays, I am called a farmer-knight. <cf>I have had to go through many hardships.
I owe a lot to everyone. <cf>So I will use this material for everyone.
As a farm knight, I hope I can help others.
Thanks to the adventurers, I guess. <cf>On behalf of the farmers of Barnhart, I would like to thank you.
Please come to Barnhart anytime. <cf>You are always welcome here.
I'm not used to being called a farmer-knight, but <cf>I'm very proud of you.
I must do my best to support all the farmers. <cf>I will be laughed at if I don't do my best.
<cf>When you're a peddler, you get all kinds of offers.
<cf>I'm often asked to introduce people. <cf>One of our selling points is that we have a wide range of contacts.
<cf>I've been asked to introduce you to some people. <cf>Would you be interested?
<cf>You seem to be a skilled and well-spoken man. You fit the bill.
<cf>I often go to the Principality of Barnhart for business. <cf>I've been asked to do something for you there.
<cf>There's a monster I want you to take down, <cf>and he's in a bit of a tricky spot.
So he was looking for a skilled and well-spoken adventurer.
For more information, ask <cf>Cesar, the soldier at Barnhart Castle.
Tell him <cf>Ada introduced us</cf> and he'll tell him. <cf>Thank you for your time. I'm asking for your help!
There's a monster in Barnhart that I need you to take down.
Ask a soldier named <cf>Cesar</cf> at Barnhart Castle for more details.
I hear it's going to be in a nasty place. <cf>Be sure to be prepared.
Are you the adventurer Mr. Adah introduced me to? <cf>Thanks. I've been waiting for you.
<cf>I've asked Mr. Adah, who has a good eye, to introduce me to you, because there are many types of adventurers.
I'm sure you'll be fine. <cf>Let me get right to it and talk about the request.
<cf>The monster I want you to kill is in <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>.
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_19_00_02001"/> and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_20_00_02001"/>. I need you to take them both down.
<value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>" is <cf>not a very public request.
You'd have to be a tight-lipped adventurer to ...... what? <cf>Have you ever been in an underground canal?
Well, you're the one who was ...... on the Dunkirk case. <cf>That's a safe place to ask for help.
That place is also used as an escape route in case of emergency. <cf>The fewer people who know it exists, the better.
And, of course, the less monsters there are, the better.
I'm surprised that Adah even caught your eye, even if it was by accident. <cf>No, maybe it was inevitable.
Once again, <cf>I request you to take down the monsters in "<value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>".
I know it's a dangerous opponent, but I'm counting on your help!
<value type="locationName" id="sce013"/> <cf>Request to kill the monster in <value type="enemyName" id="enemyName"><value type="enemyName" id="sce013"/>.
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_19_00_02001"/> and <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_20_00_02001"/>. Both please.
It's not a very public place. <cf>You too, please don't tell anyone about the request.
Hey, it's you. <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/><cf>It looks like you were able to kill the monster in <value type="locationName" id="sce013"/>.
That's great. I was right.
The proto-machina Dogolman was a troublesome opponent, wasn't it? <cf>You did a good job.
Some of the machina's are <cf> discarded as failures.
They get moved around without our knowledge and <cf>sometimes we have problems like this one.
I'd better think a little about how to dispose of them: ......
Now you want me to go find <cf>someone</cf> who can dispose of the machina safely?
Good grief, you're a real people person, aren't you?
Haha, sorry. <cf>But thanks again to you, Mr. Adah!
<cf>I think it's best to leave it to Mr. Adah to mediate difficult requests like this.
<cf>I'm sure he'll be able to flatter you. <cf>Well, I guess it's thanks to you that I can say this.
Thank you very much. <cf>It's because you did exactly what I asked you to do.
<cf>I've made a friend and an adventurer I can rely on. <cf>If I ever need anything else, I'll be sure to ask for your help.
<cf>In a country as big as Barnhart, there are a lot of jobs that require a lot of people.
<cf>Well, I'm not trying to be a prankster. <cf>You should help all kinds of people.
You never know when your connections might help you in unexpected ways.
I think there's still a lot of room for <cf>development in Kanaroa.
It's close to Barnhart Castle, and <cf>Asterlys' liner passes right through there.
If you get it going right, <cf>you could do some big business!
Hey there!　I see that you've come to <cf>explore</cf> new possibilities.
I'm thinking of going into business. <cf>I want to make Canaroa more exciting!
It's close to Barnhart Castle and <cf>Asterlys' liners go offshore.
It's a place with a lot of potential<cf> to grow even bigger!
I want to develop business and industry in Canaroa, besides seafood!
Eventually, I want to make Canaroa a big city and <cf>I want my name to be engraved in history as a great merchant!
<cf>This request is the first step toward the future. <cf>I'll be paid handsomely for it. It's a cost that needs to be paid now.
<cf>"First of all, I'm going to make a specialty product to rival the seafood. <cf>There is a flower that blooms only in <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>.
The seeds of these flowers are full of nutrients and could be used in <cf>various processed products!
However, since monsters also come to eat them, <cf>it is difficult to collect them safely.
We need a drastic solution. <cf>That's why I'm asking you to help!
<cf>First, let's gather clues and find out what kind of monsters appear!
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/><cf>Could you please go to <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>and collect some "tooth-shaped seeds"?
They're pretty big seeds. <cf>I think there's some leftover food down there.
If you see the real thing, you'll know what you're dealing with. <cf>After that, I'm going to ask you to take it down, so please do!
I think the dentition will give me an idea of what kind of <cf>monster</cf> you want me to take down, so...
I've prepared a reward for you, including the defeat. <cf>Please be enthusiastic and complete the request!
Good work! <cf>I see you were able to collect the "tooth-shaped seeds".
Good, you left a perfect dentition. <cf> Well, according to the illustrated book I bought at the pioneer station: ......
I see!　This is the dentition of <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>!
What is it ......? <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> is a mutant of the Kaiser Elk and is quite ferocious!
They are basically herbivores, but they have a temper and can attack humans and animals.
I'm glad I included the request to take down the elk. <cf>I couldn't have dealt with such a monster on my own.
Once again, could you <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> be the one to take down <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>?
I need <cf>you</cf> to help me advance my business!
I need you to defeat <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> of <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>. <cf>It seems to be quite strong, so be careful!
<cf>I need you to help me to advance my business!　I'm counting on you!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> for taking down <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/>! <cf>Thank you!
<cf>Thank you! Now you can go back to collecting in "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>". <cf>My business is finally starting!
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> is a tough and rare monster!
That's what it says in the illustrated book. <cf>It takes a skilled adventurer to defeat it.
I guess that means you're a good adventurer too! <cf>I'm lucky to know a good adventurer!
...... Hmm?　<cf>As for rare monsters, maybe <value type="enemyName" id="E004_02_00_00000"/> meat would have been more profitable?
No, that wouldn't be an ongoing business. <cf> I'm not looking to make one-off money.
I want new commerce and industry to take root in Kanaloa and grow it into a <cf>big city!
Thanks a lot! <cf>Next time you come see me, I'll be big in business!
Hey there, adventurer! <cf>I've started working on a new product right away!
<cf>I see the day is coming soon when Kanaroa will have a new specialty!
<cf>I'm sure this port will be reborn in a big way! <cf>I think there will even be a pier named after me!
<cf>We're a bit shorthanded after the Dunkirk incident!
I've got a lot of work piling up myself too. ...... <cf>Oh, no. I'll be working overtime again. ......
Oh, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your time.
Sorry, just a moment. <cf>I'll get the paperwork done right away. ......
[--]Phew, sorry for the wait. <cf>I've been a little busy with work.
<cf>Since the incident with the former Commander of Dunkirk, <cf>the entire Principality of Barnhart is seriously understaffed.
I have been sent out to deal with monsters myself. <cf> Recently, there have been many <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>damages.
We need to <cf>get it all together and clean it up, from planning the extermination plan to deploying it.
Once this is all done, I should be able to finally take a leave of absence.
This time, I forgot to <cf>get</cf> my leave authorization letter from my superiors. ......
That's how I blew my last vacation.
Adventurer. I'm sorry, but could you <cf>pick up the permission letter for me instead?
My superior is out of town right now supervising training. <cf>I couldn't take the time to go there myself. ......
<cf>Instructor Lambert should be in camp <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>.
I have already applied for a leave of absence, so if you tell him <cf>Seto asked you to come, he should be able to tell you.
I look forward to working with you. <cf>Now, in the meantime, I need to arrange for some crab spider repellent equipment: ......
Instructor Lambert should be in camp <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/> supervising the training of new recruits.
I will understand if you say Set's request, so please go and get the <cf>leave of absence letter</cf>.
In the meantime, I <value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/>must <cf>proceed with the measures. ......
C'mon, you guys! <cf>Don't you take this seriously, you chickenshits!
[--]Hmm?　This is the adventurer. <cf> Sorry for shouting so loud.
The new recruits are getting sloppy! <cf>Will you get into the spirit of things, adventurer?
Hm, what is it?　Did you get a request from Set?
You forgot to pick up your ...... vacation permit? <cf>You're slack!　I'll have to go back to work on you!
What a joke. <cf>I know how hard Set works.
Of course I'll grant you a leave of absence. <cf>Here's your permit. Deliver it to Set.
But there is one condition.
This permit will only be valid if <cf>it is accompanied by a set of "Nourishing Nuts".
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>", but the nuts can be found in <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>. <cf>Set's not going to have time to go and get them.
I'm sorry, but would the adventurers please gather them and deliver them to him<cf>together?
<cf>Eat something nourishing and rest your body. <cf>I would be grateful if you could tell him that.
I will train the chicks. <cf>Because that will lighten the load on my men.
So, I'll have some 'nourishing nuts' please. <cf>I'm sure you can find them by looking for "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>"
[--]Mm. Hey, you guys, what are you slacking off on? <cf>Get back to your posts!　After that, swing a thousand times!
<value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>Gather some <cf>nourishing nuts</cf> from <value type="locationName" id="fld005_E"/>.
I want you to deliver it to Set along with the permit. <cf>Well, what the hell!　A boring parting gift from a superior officer.
Sorry to trouble you, adventurer. <cf>Thanks for your help.
Ah, Mr. Adventurer!　Oh, my goodness!
What, a leave of absence? <cf>Thank you, but that's not all!
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/> has appeared and is <cf> closing in on a nearby settlement!
We cannot afford to gather people now. <cf>Will you help us?
It's a bit much, but we need to take them out 15 at a time. <cf>When we kill that many, the herd should pull back.
We must minimize the damage. <cf>The location is "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". Let's hurry!
<value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/> is approaching the settlement! <cf>Let's head out to defeat them immediately!
If we take them out 15 at a time, the herd should disperse!
The location is "<value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>". <cf>Let's hurry!
Good work, adventurers. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E013_00_02_01001"/> has escaped!
We have also repaired the fence. <cf>This should be good for the time being.
Thanks to you adventurers. <cf>If the village was razed, there would be nothing we could do.
Thank you for your cooperation in defeating them!
Ah, yes. <cf>You asked for a vacation permit, didn't you?
Yes, I certainly received it. <cf> Huh?　Is this "Nourishing Nuts"?
Valid with the permit, Instructor Lambert? <cf>...... Oh, I see. The instructor sent them to you, yes.
He must have been <cf>concerned</cf> because I only applied last time and didn't take a break!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all the help you've been giving me. <cf>This time, thanks to the adventurers, I will be able to take a proper rest!
Thank you for your help. <cf>If there is anything else I can do, please let me know!
Now that things have finally come to a close, <cf>I'm going to take a good rest!
After that, it looks like I'll be working again. ...... <cf>My superiors seem to care about me, and I will do my best!
<cf>Buffalian heritage can be found <cf>in unexpected places.
Sometimes they turn up when you dig up a field,<cf>or when they get caught on a fishing hook in the river.
<cf>Non-adventurers sometimes find them, you know. <cf>It's dangerous, though, so only a technician should touch it.
I'm an engineer whose job is to <cf>repair and maintain</cf> the heritage of Buffalia.
There's an antique dealer in Kanaroa named Narai. <cf>I've known him for a long time.
He's a very astute guy, <cf>he often finds Buffalian heritage.
but it's not his business. <cf>He sends them to me.
That's been a big help, but <cf>I haven't heard from Narai in a while.
If it's just that he can't find the legacy,<cf> that's fine, but I'm a little worried.
I'm just worried that there might be some kind of accident with the Buffalo legacy.
I'm sorry, but could you go check it out?
I'm Narai, an antiques dealer from Kanaloa. <cf>If he's in trouble, give him a hand.
<cf>Narai, an antiques dealer in Kanaroa.
He's a guy I've been taking care of for a while. <cf>If he's in any kind of trouble, give him a hand.
I'm Narai, the antique dealer. What can I do for you?
Did Johnson ask you to come check on him? <cf> Oh, yeah. I guess I haven't heard from you in a while.
Sorry about that. <cf> I couldn't find the Buffalo legacy.
I didn't have anything to send him, so <cf>I just kind of fell off the grid. Sorry about that.
Actually, the other day. <cf>I was out and about, and I ran into <value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/>.
He bit through my bag and <cf> swallowed my keys along with it.
And in it was the key to the <cf>warehouse</cf> where they kept the Buffalo legacy.
I couldn't even get into the house. ...... <cf>I had to break a window. Good grief.
<cf>That's why I couldn't call Johnson.
Fortunately, I didn't get hurt. <cf>But we can't leave the warehouse like this.
Anta, I'm sorry, but would you do me a favor?
<value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/><cf>I need you to get back <value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/>the "Antique Dealer's Key Bundle".
There are 5 keys in total. <cf>Can you collect them all? Sorry, please.
I need you to go to <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/> and kill five <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E001_09_00_00000"/>.
They should have swallowed the "Antique Dealer's Key Bundle". <cf>Can you get all five of them back?
Oh, Anta! <cf> You took back the "Antique Dealer's Keyring", didn't you?
Yes, I have all five. <cf>Thank you so much!　Thank you.
Just give me a minute. <cf>I'll go pack up the contents of the warehouse.
Sorry, I've kept you waiting. <cf>You're going back to Asterlys, right?
Then take this with you.
<cf>I put together the Buffalo legacy from the warehouse.
I want you to give it to Johnson. <cf>To apologize for worrying you.
<cf>Tell him that I'll send him another inheritance <cf>if I find one.
Thanks for the bundle of keys. <cf>Take care of them and have a safe trip back to Asterlys.
It would be great if you could get Johnson to give me the package.
I've put together the Buffalo legacy. <cf> Also tell him I'll send it to him if I find more.
Adventurer, you're back from Kanaloa. <cf>How was Narai?
...... Well, I just lost the key to the warehouse. <cf> Glad everything's ok, man.
Thanks for the help in taking down the monster. <cf>Thanks from me too.
Hmm?　You got a package for me from Narai?
Oh!　It's a legacy from Buffalia, isn't it? <cf>Thanks for that. I'll take it.
<cf>Buffalian heritage can be found lying around in places other than the ruins.
<cf>Anyone like Narai who can find it on a moment's notice is a rare find.
They can be a treasure trove of different things from the ruins, <cf>or they may still have some unusual functionality.
Sometimes, research into heritage and technological development <cf>can be advanced from such a place.
Of course, the adventurer's contribution is also significant. <cf>Thank you for your help this time!
Thank you very much! <cf>I and Narai will never forget this debt of gratitude.
<cf>Narai's as funny as ever. <cf>I'm going to find the legacy of Buffalia.
<cf>The Buffalian cult seems to be interested too. <cf>Maybe it would be good to put a face to face once in a while.
<cf>I'm sure the Order would buy a lot of the antiques he's selling.
I'm not very good at talking to people. ......
Can someone please talk for me ......
Wow, wow, uh, uh... ......
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. <cf> I'll let this girl talk for me: ......
'[--]Oh, my gosh!　I'm Nina, the stuffed animal! <cf>This girl's name is Rebecca. Nice to meet you."
"Rebecca is a bit shy, so <cf>Nina will talk for her.
<cf>"I learned how to do this from a traveling puppeteer. <cf>Mr. Paolo, ......, right?
"Anyway, could you <cf>hear Rebecca and Nina's story?
"Rebecca wants to go <cf>thank</cf> the people who have been so kind to her.
"But I get so nervous and embarrassed in front of them that I can't speak properly.
'So I want the adventurers to come with me and <cf>thank</cf> me together!
"<cf>I'm sure Rebecca will be able to do her best if she's with you.
'<cf>I have three people I want to thank. <cf>They all live in Asterlys.
'Go to them and <cf>give them a bowing gesture!
'First of all, Largo, the bookseller. <cf>He'll give Rebecca a lovely picture book.
'<cf>When you find Mr. Largo, <cf>give him a bow!
'Well, I'm asking you! <cf>Here, Rebecca!　First of all, thank the adventurer!
Oh, thanks to ......! <cf>The ...... Oh, please, please ......!
'Find Mr. Largo in Asterlys and <cf>give him a bowing gesture!
'It's the bookstore where Rebecca is helping me. <cf>I want to thank you all for your hospitality.'
We are a bookstore. <cf>What can I do for you, adventurer?
<cf>I'm still busy. <cf>If it's not an order, you can come back later.
<cf>Now, Rebecca's. <cf>What kind of picture book would she like next......
...... what? <cf>Largo the bookseller, that's me, for sure.
<cf>Have you ever been in my store before? <cf>I don't remember any adventurers thanking me.
Oh, wow. ...... that ......
Hmm?　...... Rebecca, huh? <cf>I sent you a picture book addressed to your mother.
That ...... picture book, always ......
Oh, ugh ....... <cf>Bo, adventurer,......
If you have something to say, <cf>say it from your own mouth. Rebecca.
I heard from this adventurer. <cf>But I haven't heard anything from you.
I'm glad you came all the way to ....... <cf>But that's not your only errand.
Come back when you can do it yourself.
'...... Largo, I guess you were mad at me. <cf>Nina was a little taken aback too.'
'But she said to come back. <cf>Rebecca said she would try again!
<cf>"In the meantime, she wants to thank the others and <cf>practice</cf>."
'Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Next, can you help me find Mr. Herritt, the delivery man?
"<cf>Mr. Herritt is the one who delivers Largo's picture books.
"<cf>"Go to Mr. Herritt and bow to him like you did before.
'<cf>Next, will you look for Mr. Herritt, the delivery man? <cf>Herritt is somewhere in Asterlys.
Ahhh~. <cf>It's another beautiful day~!
Hey, sometime adventurer. <cf>Thank you for taking over the delivery for me that time~.
<cf>Saying thank you is nice, isn't it~? <cf> It makes both the person saying it and the person being thanked feel good~!
Hey, what's going on? <cf> Did I do something to be thanked?
Hey, it's Rebecca.　It's Rebecca, isn't it? <cf>I see you're with the adventurers today.
Oh, that ......, right? <cf>Yes, thank you ...... for always delivering picture books ......
Oh, I wanted to thank you ......<cf>I asked the adventurer to follow me......
I can't talk to you properly if I'm alone,......<cf> so I wanted to thank you. ......
I see. You're welcome.
<cf>I'm so proud of you for thanking me properly! <cf>I'd probably just take a nap and forget about it.
Besides, I think it's important to <cf>try</cf> to do with someone what you can't do by yourself.
When I don't feel like it, I ask <cf>adventurers to deliver for me.
'Nina, I <cf>think</cf> that's okay.
'But it's fine!　Thank you, adventurer. <cf> I could thank Mr. Herritt!'
'There's one more person Rebecca <cf>would like to thank: ......'
'Mr. Largo sends along <cf>a lovely letter with the picture book!
"<cf>She really wants to <cf>thank the person who writes the letter!
'I don't think Mr. Largo is <cf>writing it. ......'
Then it must be Lindsay the Substitute Writer~!
Largo's handwriting is so powerful! <cf>I could never write a cute letter~!
Lindsey is a girl, and <cf>I'm sure she could write a letter that would please Rebecca!
'Oh, yes. <cf>Thanks for letting me know, Ms. Herritt!"
'Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Can you take me to Ms. Lindsay?'
'<cf>When you see Ms. Lindsay, <cf>please give her another bow!
Oh, please ......!　Adventurer!
'Could you please find Ms. Lindsay the Substitute Writer?
"When you see Ms. Lindsay, <cf> give her another bowing gesture!"
<cf>I'll put my heart and soul into my handwritten paper today!
<cf>I'm going to put my heart and soul into my handwritten paper today, too!　I've been heard. <cf>Lindsey's Handwriting Shop is here!
<cf>I don't have any requests for adventurers today. <cf>What can I do for you?
Huh? <cf>Did I do something that the adventurers would appreciate?
I may have <cf>requested something from my side, but ......
Well, uh, ......! <cf>Mr. Lindsay. Thank you for your lovely letter.
I, Rebecca ....... <cf>Largo sent me your picture book: ......
I always look forward to your letters. They are so cute. <cf>So I wanted to thank you ......
Oh, so that's why you came all the way out here? <cf>Thank you!　I'm so happy!
Hehehe......
<cf>I'm glad you're happy! <cf>And then there's Largo...what should I do? ......
<cf>I still want to thank you properly, but I don't know what to do: ......
Largo is so eccentric! <cf> That face and voice are a little scary, aren't they?
But every time I send him a picture book, he asks me to write for him. <cf> He's a bean, and he's a good guy at heart.
Ah, yes!　Hey, Rebecca. <cf> If it's too hard to tell me in person, how about a letter?
I can teach you how to write them. <cf>Then you can tell them how you feel even if you can't talk to them.
Oh, ......!　<cf>I want to write! <cf>I want to write to you, Largo!
Okay, I'll leave it to you! <cf>Well then, let's get started!
<cf>I'll bring you a special letter set, too!
And here it is: ....... A letter to Mr. Largo!
Yes, yes, I think it's a nice letter! <cf>I'm sure Largo will be very pleased if you give it to him!
'Mr. Adventurer, will you <cf>follow me to Mr. Largo again?
<cf>"I want you to come with me, adventurer. <cf>Next time you don't have to bow!
'<cf>Will you come with me to Mr. Largo's place once more?
'Just talk to me normally this time. <cf>Please, adventurer!
<cf>Another time. <cf>Rebecca is with me, what do you want?
Oh, um, ...... this is ......!
Hmm?　Is this a ...... letter? <cf>...... Rebecca wrote this?
Oh, um...... uh...... yes, sir!
La, thank you Largo for that......
......Well written. <cf>You write much better than I do!
[Thanks for your picture books. <cf>Thank you for reading them too.
<cf>We'll look forward to sending you more interesting books. Rebecca
......Yeah!　Thanks, Largo.
Oh, um, you know, ....... <cf>Bo, Adventurer, you can also write to ............
Rebecca wrote to say <cf>thank you</cf> to the adventurer, too!
'Thank you very, very much! <cf>It was nice of you to thank me with her!"
Ehehe ....... <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
I'll try to thank you myself next time!
Oh, you're the adventurer. ...... <cf>Good luck with your work!
Nina also says ["]good luck["]. ......
Hehehe ....... <cf>It's a little embarrassing, but I could say it: ......
<cf>Senior civilian officials like us are also running around, cleaning up after a series of incidents.
They are rushed from the top and complained about by the military. ...... <cf>Ugh, my stomach hurts......
Adventurers. <cf>Will you help us?
We are currently investigating the <cf>old underground canals that exist in Barnhart Castle.
It is a facility that has already been scrapped, but we are considering the possibility of <cf>reusing it.
We are going to do a field survey to see if there are any hazards such as aging.
Well, since it is quite old, <cf>it is unlikely that it will actually be reused. ......
Even if seemingly pointless, we will keep track of its condition. <cf>That is also the job of a civilian official. Hi.
Actually, I had Barnhardt's army send <cf>soldiers to help us earlier.
<cf>They were hit by a monster that was lurking in the underground canal, and <cf>they ran away and came back.
Well, here I come. ...... <cf>The top brass rushed us to finish as soon as possible.
<cf>The military would push me up against them for injuring a soldier.
I have to keep my head down and get on with the job. <cf>Ugh, it's itty bitty....... My stomach hurts......
So I have concluded that it is best to <cf>ask</cf> a trusted adventurer for help!
Could you <cf>conduct an additional survey of the "Old Underground Canal of Barnhart Castle"?
Please report back to me when you have finished. <cf> I am taking care of another matter here.
Ugh, this one is going to take a lot of work too. <cf>My stomach is in knots......
<cf>Could you please conduct <cf>an additional survey of the Old Underground Canal of Barnhart Castle?
Please report back to me when you are done. <cf>Please do not hurt yourself, adventurers.
<cf>Thank you for your hard work on the "Additional Survey of the Old Underground Canal at Barnhart Castle"!
Now I can finally compile my report. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation!
Now my stomach can rest ....... <cf>I wish I could. Ouch.
Now I'm struggling with whether I should exterminate the monsters in the canal or <cf>leave them alone: ......
Exterminating them would be expensive, but we can't <cf>leave them alone.
So both are problematic. Hi.
Well, it is <cf> our job as civil servants to do something about it, so
I'll give up and move on to the next document. <cf>Thank you very much for your help this time.
If I have any more questions, I will <cf>request them again. HI.
We are <cf>looking around in Kanaroa and other settlements like this!
We don't know where the problems are. <cf>Sincerely going out and about is part of my job, yes.
<cf>I heard about the tragic events at the Royal Institute of Drava.
I have not heard all the details, but ......
I would like to offer my prayers at least. <cf> May the sinful souls find forgiveness and peace.
Thank you <cf> for accepting my request on such short notice. Dear Adventurer
<cf>I am sure you have heard of the Royal Institute of Drava, Adventurer.
<cf>Worst-case scenario was averted, thanks to Mr. Carveen's efforts.
However, it is true that a tragic event did occur. <cf>The institute has been closed and an investigation is underway.
However, it seems<cf>that progress in this investigation has not been encouraging.
I have asked the Knights several times, but have not received a constructive response.
Therefore, I have <cf>requested that you, the adventurers, conduct an investigation.
I would prefer not to do anything that would infringe on the Order's territory, but <cf>we can't afford to delay too long.
Let us go to the Institute first. <cf>I will explain the situation to the Order.
<cf>The Royal Institute of Drava is being investigated by the Knights of Barnhart.
I really should leave it to you, but it seems that there has been no progress.
I will explain to the Knights how we asked the adventurers to investigate.
First of all, let's come with me to the "Dorava Royal Laboratory".
Captain~!　This is impossible! <cf>He says it's too hard~!
<cf> Don't sound so pathetic, Scherni! <cf>Are you still a member of the glorious Order of Barnhart?
Thank you for your service. <cf>Mr. Villmer, Mr. Scherni.
Huh?　It's Mr. Anelma, hello~. <cf>And you're with us, adventurer?
Hmmm!　What do you want, Anelma? <cf>Did you come to check on the progress of our survey again?
...... I'm telling you, we haven't made any significant progress.
That's right. The roads in this place are convoluted, and <cf>there are a lot of monsters roaming around.
Right now, only a rookie like me can move around, so I keep going to investigate, failing, and repeating.
Don't talk about internal affairs, you idiot!
<cf>I've asked our adventurers to investigate the "Dorava Royal Laboratory".
<cf>Mr. Villmer and Mr. Scherni must be tired. <cf>Please take your time and have a good night's rest.
Hey, wait a minute! <cf>The investigation of the institute is under the jurisdiction of the Knights!
I am aware of that, sir, but since there has been no progress in this regard for some time.
<cf>I have asked the adventurers to do so. <cf>I am willing to enter the institute if necessary.
You!　Of course not! <cf>I can't let an outsider in so easily!
Well, well, well, Captain!　And you, Anelma! <cf> Let's stop fighting as soon as we see each other!
It's because he's always saying whatever he wants!
<cf>I'm just stating the facts. <cf>If it's too much for the Knights to handle, there must be another way.
What...what...oh~?
<span size="Big">Adventurer, please! </>
<span size="Big">Additional research at the Royal Institute of Dorava, right? <cf>Please go and finish it quickly!
<cf>Come on, Scherni! <cf>What are you talking about?
No, it's the only way to get both the captain and Anelma to calm down!
Mr. Villmer. <cf>My story is not finished!
I'm not finished!　I don't have enough to say!
Come on, adventurer, now's the time!　Now! <cf> I'll take care of these two.
I'll take care of these two!
<cf> "Royal Institutes of Drava, additional research", right? <cf>Please just get it done already!
I'll take care of the captain and Anelma. <cf>It happens all the time.
Let Anelma do as she pleases! <cf>Sherni!　I knew it, you go and investigate!
<cf>Is it the behavior of a knight to force his subordinate to do something like that?
Look, already! I'm sure they're still fighting when the adventurer comes back.
Ah, it's the adventurer. <cf>Have you finished your investigation of the "Dorava Royal Laboratory"?
We are glad to hear you are safe, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation!
Muuu...... I'd have to say you've done a splendid job. <cf>Sorry for the trouble you went through on our behalf, adventurer.
The Knights thank you as well. <cf>As it turns out, the investigation was done by an outsider, but that's just the way it is.
<cf>I, an outsider, <cf>was adamant in my refusal to allow you to enter the laboratory?
Of course not!　How could I let a woman like you into such a dangerous place?
<cf>That's not the same thing as an adventurer who knows how to fight!　Think a little!
...... left, huh?
Well, Captain, I'm a woman, too. I'm a woman too.
You are a soldier!　<span size="Big">Work! </>
Ehh~, unreasonable~~!
Anyway!　I thank you for your cooperation this time, but <cf>I will not tolerate this kind of behavior in the future!
<cf>You should know your place! <cf>Are we clear, Anelma?
<cf>You always get us into fights when you talk like that!
--I understand.
You're always complaining about me and the activities of the Order.
It is true that I went too far this time. <cf>I apologize for the concern and trouble I caused to Mr. Villmer.
I also apologize for my words and actions that brought the Order into disrepute. <cf>I am sorry.
Oh, oh ......
Thank you very much, adventurer. <cf>I will now leave you. Good day to you then.
...... did I offend you in any way?　Captain.
I've never seen <cf> Anelma withdraw so frankly before?
No, there is no such thing ....... <cf>No, you haven't, have you?　Tell me there is no such thing, Sheruni.
There's no ...... isn't there? <cf>Hmm?　But it's not so much that he was angry......
It seemed like he was a little happy. <cf>What is it?　...... something is fishy~♪
Captain Vilmer-dono and Anelma-san, <cf> always in that tone, they have the worst chemistry~!
No, rather they get along well? <cf>The more they fight, the better they get along.
Could it be that those two, maybe, or ......? <cf>Eh, that would be super interesting!
I'll have to explore this one... grin!
Hey there, adventurer. <cf> You were a big help to me when I got a new kiln sometime ago.
I've tried my hand at making smoked fish since then. <cf> The kiln only explodes once in a while now.
Oh well, I guess it's all in the realm of charm...
Well, now that I've gotten used to handling the kiln. <cf>I'm looking to take my smoking to the next level.
Next, I want to focus on the chips that make the kemuri.
You know those "glowing wood chips"? <cf>It's a plant found deep in the "Giant Dragon's Claw Tracks".
<cf>I heard it smells really good when burned.
<cf> But, as expected, they don't sell it. <cf>The only way to get it is to ask an adventurer.
<cf>"Fierce battle!　I wonder if you could go deep into the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon" and get me <cf>"Glowing Piece of Wood"?
<cf>"Fierce battle!　If you go through the "Claw Traces of the Giant Dragon", you can get a <cf>"Glowing Piece of Wood".
It smells great when you burn it, and it's perfect for making <cf>smoked food</cf>.
If you make good smoked fish, I'll share it with you, so <cf>good luck with that!
Oh, thank you very much. <cf>It is indeed a "glowing piece of wood"!
Hot chichi chichi ....... <cf>It's already hot just to have it!
Kun Kun Kun ....... I see. <cf>It also smells like a deep forest!
Well then, let's set it in the smoking kiln right away......
...... Oh! It's so smoky! <cf>This thing can smoke well!
It's going to be a good smoked fish. ...... <cf> Hmmm?　It's so chemically rich! ......
Hey, I think it's coming out a little too much, don't you? <cf> Aww, stop stoppin' ...... gah, gah, gah!
Wow! <cf>We've got a big mess!
Hey, you there! <cf>What are you doing in the city!
[--]I see. <cf> He was making smoked meat with a "glowing piece of wood," he said.
How much smoke is too much? <cf>There was a call that there was a fire!
And on top of that, complaints! <cf>The laundry smelled unappealing.
Smokey flavors were added to meals! <cf>...... really a complaint?　This is...
Anyway, don't <cf>use</cf> the material from "Claws of the Giant Dragon" lightly!　It's dangerous!
I'm sorry. <cf>To repay you, we're sharing the smoked fish with the Pioneer Bureau.
Ugh, it's so delicious. ...... <cf>No, be careful anyway!
The "Glowing Piece of Wood" or ....... <cf>Will someone accept my request to collect it?
Hmmm. That is indeed a valuable material. <cf>I didn't think it would burn that great.
<cf>The smoked product is very good! <cf>But it's hard to make a lot of it!
<cf>I'll have to check again to see if there are any other good chips. <cf>Smoking is all about passion and trial and error!
I also have to make sure the Pioneer Bureau doesn't get mad at me. <cf>Thank you very much. I hope you'll accept my request again.
<cf>The Pioneer Bureau has been ordering smoked meat recently.
They sometimes give me "glowing pieces of wood". <cf>I don't know what it is, but it seems to work.
I'd like to make new smoked fish again!
I wonder if many of the merchants in Asterlys are <cf>abrupt</cf>?
[I wonder if many of the merchants in Asterlys are <cf>too rash</cf>? [They're always in a hurry.
It would be better to live in <cf>nature's rhythm, to breathe with the wind and the waves.
Welcome to Jubilia, adventurer. <cf>Are you on vacation or something?　I hope you're all right.
Take it easy when you're on vacation. <cf>Let nature take its course and live life as it is!
I am Nenemarina. <cf>I make soap for a living.
<cf>A merchant from Asterlys likes it so much that he comes all the way to Jubilia to buy it.
Well, it looks like that merchant has just arrived!
Nenemalina!　How do you like it? <cf>Have you made the soap?
I gave it to you the other day. <cf> Was that not enough?
No, no, not at all!
That soap was very popular at Asterlys. <cf>They sell out the first place we stock them.
So we need to stock more! <cf>Make some, Nenemarina!　Quickly, quickly!
You Asterries people are so impatient.
We were making one every two days to begin with. <cf>You say you're in a hurry, so you're making one every day!
I want at least twenty every day!
It's not good to be so busy. <cf>The wind and the waves, calm is best.
So is our life. <cf>We live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.
Besides, even if I wanted to make soap in the first place, <cf>I can't because I've run out of materials.
What?　Is that so?
Oh, did I not tell you? <cf>That's why I'm asking the adventurers.
<cf>That's why I'm asking you, Mr. Adventurer. I'd like you to go to <cf>Yukoku Valley in Tsukikakushi</cf> and collect eight Loloa seaweeds for me.
<cf>Because there are monsters in that area, I usually wait until they are gone.
But I don't know how many days that would take.
I'd appreciate it if you could do it for me! <cf>You can't wait for days!
Please help Nenemarina! <cf>Adventurer, come on, come on!
Oh, have you lost track of what to collect?
I know, I know. <cf>I forget things when I'm too lazy.
<cf>The Loloa Seaweed that grows in the Valley of the Hidden Moon! <cf> Eight of them!　Eight of them!
Immediately!　Immediately, please! <cf>Adventurer, come on, come on!
Oh, welcome back. <cf> You've picked up some "Loloa seaweed" for me.
Thank you very much. <cf>You're back so early, are you okay?
Yay! <cf> Now you can make soap for me!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Nenemalina, it's your turn now. Quickly, quickly!
Yes, it is. The fact that we have all the ingredients <cf>means it's time to work.
Okay, let's get to work. <cf>Come back when the soap is ready!
Yes, I will!　I look forward to working with you! <cf>Then I'll go make arrangements for transport and such!
You're an impatient man. <cf> I wonder if they don't get tired after all that running.
<cf>The foresters are in no hurry. <cf>We let nature take its course and let the trees grow.
Besides, if we take too many seaweeds at once, <cf>we will damage the ocean.
It is important to live in the rhythm of nature. <cf>That is the most reasonable way to live.
Since you've come all the way to Jubilee, you should take your time.
Oh, are you taking it easy?
<cf>When you rest, rest. <cf>Nature tells you to do that.
Fanny is still saying <cf>["]Hurry, hurry, hurry! ["]] is all she says.
I'm not going to get more soap if I hurry. <cf>I'm in trouble.
It's important to <cf>have one's heart in the fight.
Because at the end of the day, it can <cf>draw out the power that you didn't think you had.
What do you believe in? <cf>It's good to take a look at yourself once in a while.
Thank you for accepting my request. <cf>It's not easy to find someone to ask for help.
My name is Lakaka, a warrior of the forest people. <cf>I am on patrol in the Valley of the Coral Rocks.
There are good quality medicinal herbs and their ingredients. <cf>Some people go there to pick them from time to time, so we have to keep them safe.
As a warrior who keeps an eye on the outside of the forest, <cf>there is something I can only tell you from across the sea.
The truth is, ...... I've lost my precious amulet.
I always wear an amulet that I believe in. <cf> I even buy it from the continent you were on.
<cf>Most foresters use amulets of their own making, but I feel more at home with those from your continent.
It's the rare amulets from distant lands that <cf>should</cf> work better!
However, it seems that I dropped it during a monster <cf>attack</cf> in the Valley of the Coral Rocks.
Of course, I was going to go get it. <cf> But ...... I need an amulet to do that.
I have an amulet, that's what I'm trying to keep in mind. <cf>I'm so worried that I won't have it!
I need to <cf>get a new amulet to find the one I lost.
To do that, I need to meet with the trader and <cf>get him to show me an amulet that is worthy of my belief!
[--]Mm, yes. <cf>This could take me who knows how long!
So there. I'm sorry, but <cf>I need you to go find the amulet I lost.
<cf>I'm sure you can find it if you do some additional research in the Valley of the Coral Rocks. <cf>When you're done, please come back.
I'm counting on you! <cf>Well, let's go to ...... and look for the amulet.
<cf>If you complete the "Additional Survey of the Valley of the Coral Rocks," <cf> you should be able to find my lost amulet.
Come back here when you're done.
Now ...... I'll go look for the next amulet.
Have you finished "Additional Research in the Valley of the Coral Rocks"? <cf>Thank you, you did a great job.
Did you find my amulet?
Oh, yes!　This ring is the very amulet <cf>I</cf> lost!
And it's broken in half! <cf> Excellent!
Hmm?　You look like you don't know why it should be broken.
It's because this amulet has done its job. <cf>The trader told me when I bought it.
["[This ring] will protect its owner. <cf>I'm sure it will take your place when your life is threatened ["].
Isn't that just as they said? <cf>That's exactly the real thing!
I was just meeting with a trader earlier. <cf>I'll get him to look into a new amulet for you, too.
I know it's a bit pricey, but <cf>I won't hesitate if it's a real amulet!
Thank you very much! <cf>You are the one who taught me the truth about amulets.
I hope you find a good amulet!
I bought a new amulet, but <cf>you also recommended a spare amulet.
It's true, if I lose it again <cf>I'll be in trouble when I go looking for it. ......
Is it important to have a spare? <cf>No, a spare for when you lose your spare is also ......
There's a number of old folklore <cf>told around here.
There are also <cf>various stories featuring the forest people.
However, many of them have been passed down in an oral tradition or in an ambiguous way.
I think we need to keep a proper record <cf> for the sake of our descendants.
Hi, nice to meet you. <cf>I'm Omaruru. I'm a member of the forest people.
I'm trying to collect and <cf>record</cf> the folklore and stories of this area.
[Not just oral traditions or vague legends, but written records.
It would be a loss if the stories were forgotten or <cf>transmitted incorrectly.
Besides, it will be useful for our children and grandchildren to <cf>research the old history!
In fact, I'm having a hard time looking it up this way and ....... <cf>I just want to make sure it's written down properly.
So, I was hoping you adventurers could help me out.
What I'm looking into now is a story about a <cf> bandit who ran away to a certain cave.
The vicious bandit tries to get past his pursuers in the back of the cave, where no one is coming.
After a while, he runs out of the cave.
The people who were chasing the bandit were amazed. <cf>In just a few days, he had become like an emaciated old man
And then, as if he had changed his mind, he changed his heart. <cf>He confessed his sins and was caught in peace.
<cf>One of those easy to understand legends that says, "The wicked will be punished.
The problem is the cave. It's a story that's passed down around here, but <cf>I don't know where it's from.
Of course, we don't know what happened to the bandits.
So I did some research on other stories. <cf>I think the "Cave of the Sea Gods" is this cave.
<cf>The Cave of the Sea Gods has long been an object of worship for the people of this area, and has appeared in many stories.
<cf>They have been mentioned in many stories, but it is not clear what kind of place it is.
I'd like to see it, but it's a sacred place and it seems<cf> dangerous for us to go near it.
I'd like you to go there and check it out. <cf>"Additional research on the Cave of the Sea Gods," please.
<cf>"Additional Investigation of the Cave of the Sea Gods," and see what's going on inside.
It's a place that appears in many stories, but <cf>I've never been inside.
I'd be happy to find <cf>clues</cf> to the events that befell the bandits.
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>How did you like "[Sea God's Cave] - Additional Investigations"?
I'll take notes and let you know ASAP.
...... hmmm hmmm ...... hohoho ......
I had at least heard rumors, but <cf> there really are ruins of Buffalia!
What's more, the inside is filled with water from the sea, and <cf>monsters appear in it...... and
Yup. I have a feeling it's similar to the <cf>cave in the bandit story.
I wonder if the bandits ran away from the cave because <cf>they were attacked by monsters after all?
Maybe it was so terrifying that it turned him into <cf>an old man.
And if the ruins of Buffalia are involved, <cf> I wouldn't be surprised what happened.
Thanks a lot. <cf>Thanks to the adventurers, we've made progress.
As far as investigating the ruins of Buffalia, <cf> to be honest, it's a bit out of my hands. ......
<cf>I'll make sure to document this as well, since it's definitely a clue to the lore.
Maybe some descendant will look at the records and <cf>solve the real mystery!
If I find another interesting story, <cf>I'll share it with the adventurers. Bye, then.
The people of the forest live a long time, so <cf>they tend to tell everything from their own memories.
The stories <cf>often change from person to person.
I think the Buffalian civilization and<cf>humans are more robust in this respect.
If I praise them too much, they'll get mad at me.
We come up with all kinds of new menu items, but <cf>sometimes we revive old dishes</cf>.
But there are some dishes that we stopped making because we couldn't get the ingredients.
We can't make those anymore. <cf>It's a bit sad, but it can't be helped.
Hey, you!　Thanks for all your help. <cf>Are you eating well?
Actually, one of my regulars, an old man, asked me to make him some of the lunches I used to make for him.
<cf>He's moving away and wants to enjoy the taste of his memories for the last time.
I'm glad to hear that, and I <cf>want</cf> to make it, but ......
The veggies I used to put in my lunches, I can't pick them anymore.
However, a vegetable I got as a souvenir from Jubilia, <cf>"salty greens", tastes the same.
The texture is almost the same,<cf> and I think I can recreate my old lunch boxes with it!
<cf>Could you please go to Cape Lawahera and pick up seven "salty greens"?
It's your grandfather's request, and <cf>I'd like to fulfill it somehow.
I'll pull out the old recipe. <cf>I'll have to prepare other things as well.
<cf> I'm looking forward to working with you, Ata!
I want you to go to Cape Lawahera and pick up seven salty greens.
For the sake of the regulars, I asked you to take care of them!
Hey, welcome back! <cf> I see you picked some salty greens for me.
Yes, I did!　I can't complain about the leafiness and <cf>freshness</cf>!
<cf>And this salty taste when you bite into it. <cf>This gives it a nice flavor.
I'm sure my regular old man will <cf>be pleased with it.
Come on, we have to get as close to the old taste as possible. <cf>That's my job from here on out!
Thanks for everything! <cf>I'll be counting on you in the future!
Hey, you! <cf>How are you doing?
<cf>I've rearranged some of the old menu items and they've been well received and appreciated.
You should <cf>relive</cf> the old days once in a while!
It's interesting that there are so many <cf>unusual ingredients</cf> in the world of baboon ......[Outer Continent].
Plants brought from Jubilia are <cf>sometimes</cf> available!
It's interesting to me as a chemist, too. <cf>I'm sure I could make all sorts of medicines. Hee-hee-hee.
Hee-hee, I've been waiting for you.
You seem to be as active as ever, Anta. <cf> You've been well-received at the pioneer station.
No, no, no, no. <cf>Making my own transformation potion will be a lot easier. Hee hee hee.
Actually, I'm in need of a different kind of material again. <cf>It can only be found at Cape Lawehara.
<cf>It's a plant called "water-runner grass" that can be found in "Tsukikakushi no Yūgokudani".
I was lucky enough to get it the other day, but I lost it in an unfortunate accident.
To be precise, it was confiscated by the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>That's a terrible thing to do, baboon!
<cf> I had to pick it up locally, since it wasn't for sale.
But I've been on the radar of the Bureau of Pioneer Affairs for a while now, and I can't get on a boat to Jubilia.
So, that's where you come in. <cf>I need you to deliver me about eight packets of water-runner grass.
<cf>I'm not going to hurt you, you're the only one who can do it. <cf>You're the only one I can ask. <cf>Thank you. Hee-hee-hee.
<cf>Please deliver me eight plants from Cape Lawahera, <cf>"Water Runner Grass".
<cf>I wouldn't have bothered with you if that accident hadn't happened.
Well, some days you just don't have any luck. <cf>Then, I'm counting on you. Hee-hee-hee.
Oh, "water-runner grass"! <cf>As expected, you work fast. Hee-hee-hee.
Thanks to you, I can<cf> resume the experiments necessary for the transformation potion. <cf>Thank you. Hee-hee-hee!
Now I'll just have to be <cf>careful not to be discovered by the pioneering bureau. Hee-hee-hee-hee.
Hmm?　How it was confiscated by the Bureau of Pioneer Affairs? <cf> Well, I never told you.
<cf> There is a legend that if you use the "Water Running Grass" well, you can run on water.
<cf>And depending on the monster that is transformed by the transformation potion, <cf>whether or not it floats on water is also important, right?
I thought I'd try that first. <cf>But I don't really know how to do it.
I thought I'd just put it all over my body and jump in the water.
Then I guess he called the cops. <cf>A green monster appeared on the beach!　I thought....
So, they took me to the Pioneer Bureau and confiscated <cf>all</cf> my "water-runners". Hee hee hee.
<cf>That was to make a transformation potion. <cf>It's natural to have a problem or two like this.
<cf>I'm getting to a good point with the concoction. <cf> I'll be indebted to you until the end.
I'll look forward to working with you again next time. baboon baboon baboon baboon ......
It is indeed bad to make enemies of the pioneering bureau, <cf>I should ask for a little indulgence. Hee-hee-hee.
<cf>I'm still a conciliator. <cf>I'll make you some medicine for your wounds and deliver it to you.
<cf>I've got a good reputation, you know. <cf>You might be using it without knowing it. Hee hee hee.
Ummm... ...... I'm not getting any work done.
Don't you think it's better for people to <cf>be honestly offended</cf> when they do something wrong?
It's not like you'd feel uncomfortable if you were allowed to do something badly. ......
No, that's for your own convenience. <cf>You're in no position to complain.
I'm sorry to be so pathetic. <cf>It's not about getting help from others. ......
<cf>I got so wrapped up in work that I slept through a whole day off.
I was supposed to go out with my family, <cf>but I blew it off.
My wife and kids are very understanding, <cf>they all say they don't care.
That, on the other hand, made me feel bad. ...... <cf>It would be easier if you just got mad at me.
No, let's not. <cf>I sowed the seeds for all of this myself.
Anyway, I want to apologize to my family. <cf>But as you know, I'm not very good at talking.
The only thing I can move is my hands. <cf>I thought I'd at least make something to give them.
I've heard that <cf> there are interesting materials and anecdotes at Cape Lawehala.
The material is "sea-bright hard iron" from "Ia Mole [reef]. <cf>It would be helpful to have five of them.
Also, could you get five <cf>"Drops of Frost Shell" from the crab spider frost in "Ia Mole [Reef]"?
<cf>They produce a hard and strong metal, which they use to make gifts for their loved ones.
<cf>It represents a strong bond, you know. <cf>Simple enough, but just right for me right now.
It's a long trip to "Ia Mole [reef],"<cf> but do me a favor, will you? Thank you.
Can you get me <cf>five each of "Sea Brilliant Hard Iron" and "Drops of Frost Shell"?
Both can be found at <cf>"Ia Mole [Reef]" at Cape Lawehala.
You can collect "sea-bright hard iron". <cf>"Drops of Frost Shell" can be obtained by defeating Kanikumo Frost.
I'm sorry to drag you into this for my own reasons. <cf>You are the one I'm relying on. Please take care of me.
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I see you brought the material safely.
Is this the "Kaihatsu-hard iron"? <cf>I see, it has an unusual texture.
It's a little different from the ore in the Asteria Plain. <cf>It's also quite hard.
<cf>I hear it can be made even sturdier if combined with a "drop of frost shell.
I think I found such a description in an old weapons record. <cf>Is there a hint of a 400 year old manufacturing method ......?
Hmm, no!　I'm thinking about work again. <cf>That's not why I asked you to do this.
I'm using this guy for my family. <cf>Yeah, ...... the pots and pans were getting damaged by now.
Our cookware is all old, <cf>I think I'll just put it all together and get a new one around here.
Thanks, man...<cf>I'll be sure to get some new pots and pans soon. Thanks to you, <cf>I'll be able to do something for my family.
I'm glad I asked you to help. <cf>I'll be in touch if you ever need anything else.
I'm going to take this opportunity to spend <cf>more time talking to my wife and kids.
<cf>I guess top adventurers don't just deliver materials, <cf>they also deliver opportunities.
<cf>Well, that's all I'm going to say about you. <cf>Well, that's how grateful I am to you.
<cf>Well, that's how grateful I am to you.
It's not good to spend it on a whim. <cf>I think that as an adult, you need to have self-control!
You should have self-control too, adventurer. <cf>Don't imitate my father.
Adventurer~! <cf>My family's finances are in a big pinch again~!
<cf>I asked you to help me make armored plates to sell to the Barnhardt Knights before, didn't I?
We didn't get an official adoption, but we did get some recognition from the Order.
And then they gave us <cf>funding</cf> to develop more advanced technology.
This is finally a relief!　I thought it was .......
Dad said, "["]I've wanted this for a long time! [I've been wanting this for a long time!
That's because expensive tools are easier to use, right? <cf>I've always wanted to touch them, but...
<cf>But..!　The family's finances are still in a pinch! <cf> Or perhaps the situation is worse than before!
<cf>[I]There are conditions for the financial support of the Order. <cf> ["...to develop and deliver materials useful to the Order..."].
If you can't do that, they will take it away from you, but <cf>Dad is so busy with his tools that he hasn't been able to do anything!
That's why! <cf>We have to make new armor plates no matter what!
If this fails, our house will go bankrupt! <cf>But fortunately I only have all the tools!
Don't look at me like I only have tools ......!　My heart hurts!
Please!　<cf>I need some help from adventurers until we can get new armor plates!
First, I'm going to try the ore that can be found in Cape Lawehala, at Shiota-uchi [beach].
My father told me about it a long time ago. <cf>The old legend of the "moonlight iron sand" from "Shiotaichi [beach]".
[The armor that is dotted with small dots in the moonlight cannot be pierced by the fangs of any beast.
I don't often use materials from Cape Rawehala, <cf>I think it's worth a try!
Adventurer, go get 5 pieces of "Moonlight Iron Sand". <cf> You can pick them up at "[Shiotai]chi [Hama]".
To prevent our bankruptcy and the separation of our family! <cf>Please help us~!
I need you to collect 5 pieces of "Moonlight Iron Sand" at "Shiotaichi Beach" in Cape Lawehala.
If I don't make and deliver new armor plates, <cf>they will take away the Order's financial support!
There may be other materials needed. ......<cf>First, I need 5 pieces of "Moonshine Iron Sand", please!
Yay, "Moonshadow Iron Sand"! <cf>Thank you very much, adventurer!
I wonder if this will be enough armor to make it impervious to the fangs of any beast.
For now, I'll try to use our furnace to make <cf>armor plate</cf>. Wait a minute!
Here you go! <cf> Hmmm, I guess it didn't turn out to have such great properties.
It's not that strong and not very flexible. <cf>It's not very strong, it's not very flexible, and it's not suitable for mass production.
<cf>A large workshop affiliated with a knighthood might be able to handle it, but a small blacksmith like ours can't.
U~~, I'm kind of disappointed! <cf>Even though our store is necessary for the dukedom.
<cf>Big workshops aren't the only ones supporting Barnhart's military power.
It's each and every store, each and every craftsman. <cf>There are a lot of small forces coming together to support the country.
...... small, force?
Huh?　I might have heard something about that. <cf>The legend of Cape Lawehala that my father knew.
A stone called "The Moon Spots". <cf>It's small, but he said it's used in many places: ......
<span size="Big">--That's it!　That's it! </>
The "Moon Spots" are small and hard to notice! <cf>Combine that with "moonlight iron sand"!
Legend also says that the "small spot on the armor was struck by the moonshadow". This is what the little dots were all about!
Adventurer!　One more time, please! <cf>Gather up five "Moon Spots" in "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku"!
Now you can recreate the legend! <cf> I'm sure it will work!
I'm sorry it's the same kind of work. <cf>Go to "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku" again.
<cf>I want you to collect five of the ores called "moon spots.
If I can recreate the legend with this, <cf>I should be able to convince the Knights!
The Moon Spots!　Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Sorry I made you go twice.
I'll use it right away! <cf>Now I'll let Dad help you!
Yay!　We did it, Mr. Adventurer!
<cf>I was able to make a very sturdy armored plate using "Moonlight Iron Sand" and "Moon Spots"!
There are a few technical challenges, but <cf>I can report this combination of materials to the Order!
Now we can meet the requirements for financial support and <cf>maybe we can get new support!
I guess I should thank my dad for once. <cf>And I got a hint from the legend of Cape Lawehala.
...... No. It's Dad's fault we got in a pinch. <cf>Let's put the thanks on hold.
But an extra big thanks to the adventurer! <cf>Adventurer helped me out with everything!
Now that we have all the tools we need, <cf>let's get to work!
Good tools are expensive, but <cf>they're also worth it!
<cf>Adventurers' weapons are the same way, aren't they? <cf>We get excited when we use good things, don't we?
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't spend <cf>money that will tilt your livelihood!
Tomorrow's weather is ...... mmmm ....... <cf>Sunny ......?　No. Cloudy with a hint of rain......?
Hmmm, they say mountain weather is changeable, but <cf> it's really hard to forecast!
This is going to be worthwhile to observe. <cf>It'll be interesting to see what valuable records you can gather.
Hey there, you adventurer. <cf>Thanks for taking the request.
Do you remember me? <cf>I'm Feodor, a scholar who wants to make weather forecasting a reality.
The road to weather forecasting is still a work in progress...... and <cf>more like a guessing game!
It is far from an accurate forecast. <cf>We still don't have enough observations.
Under what conditions do temperatures change? <cf>How cloud movement and humidity are related: ......
Even the most trivial records, which are somewhat difficult to understand, <cf>have to be collected and studied steadily.
The old saying goes that the weather in the mountains is changeable, <cf>and the Montenol valley is similar.
<cf>Montenot Valley is similar. If we record the weather here, it will be useful for future research.
That's why I'm looking for a place to set up my observation equipment.
The top of "Tower Rock" is a very good location because of its height.
However, the road there is steep and I couldn<cf>t find an accurate map.
The "Tower Rock Mine Site" is especially tricky. <cf>They say the more they dig, the more the hole widens, which wasn't in the mining plan.
If I wander in, it will be difficult for me to get out.
So, I'd like to ask you, an adventurer, to investigate <cf>"Tower Rock Mine Ruins.
Gather information and make a map first. <cf>We'll proceed with weather observations based on that.
I want you to conduct the "Tower Rock Mine Site Survey" and <cf>report the results</cf>. Thank you.
<cf>I would like you to conduct a "Tower Rock Mine Site Survey" and report back to me. <cf>I want to get an accurate picture of the topography of that area.
I will proceed with the meteorological observation after that. <cf>Everything must be done steadily, one step at a time.
<cf>When you have completed your "Tower Rock Mine Site Survey," please come back to me for a report.
<cf>I see you have completed the "Tower Rock Mine Site Investigation. <cf>Thank you very much.
Thanks to you, I will be able to make a detailed map. <cf>We will also be able to install observation equipment at "Tower Rock".
We are one step closer to accurate weather observations, and <cf>the map itself will be useful in many fields.
I'm sure your accomplishments will stand the test of time for generations to come.
I, too, must work to establish weather forecasting. <cf>If we can predict storms in the mountains, it will lead to great safety.
I've lost family members at sea, but <cf>similar accidents and tragedies can happen on land.
I think we <cf>have to work hard to reduce the number of such stories.
Hmmm, I've told too many stories. <cf>I tend to get carried away in front of you.
I may have to ask you again. <cf>Thank you then for making the weather forecast a reality.
The weather records you collected in "Tower Rock" <cf>are quite interesting.
It is quite different from Asterlys. <cf>We will get different records in other regions.
I'd be interested in deserts, coasts, and forested areas too. <cf>There's a lot to look into, but I'm a little worried about funding: ......
Haha, Roddy, you're a good friend of mine: ....... <cf>How long will it take you to notice me?
They say men should catch the stomach first, but <cf>I'm starting to think just catching it isn't enough.
It's ...... okay if I feed you something that seems to <cf>work a little better, right?
Hello, adventurer. <cf>Thank you again and again for your help. Thank you.
You saved my cousin Katya, didn't you? <cf>I was so grateful for your help with Joan and everything.
I was worried about you too, so I'm really glad! <cf>Thank you again!
<cf>Now that we've taken care of Katya, <cf>I have a request for you today.
I'm looking for a few ingredients. <cf>I'm looking for something that I can't get in Minsterhorn.
<cf>I'm looking for clams from Cape Lawehala.
It's too far from Minsterhorn, but <cf>adventurers can go to Cape Lawehala, right?
Not the other ones! <cf>It really has to be "[shioma]-chi clams"!
Well, you see!　We have good milk at home! <cf>They are great in clam chowder!
<cf>So, we definitely need "Shiomaichi clams"!
That's why I'm asking you! <cf>"Shiotaichi clams" from "Shiotaichi Hama"!
Because I want them freshly picked locally! <cf>Thank you!
I want you to go to Cape Lawahera and get me some <cf>"Shiotaichi clams" from the beach.
I think five is all we need. <cf>"You can't have anything else!
You see, clams are essential to clam chowder, right? <cf>I must have "shiomaichi clams!　Please!
Oh, Meris, you're making me nervous. <cf>Why don't you calm down a little?
I'm not fidgeting!
I just want to start cooking <cf>as soon as the clams arrive.
You see!　If the clams lose their freshness, <cf>we'd feel bad for the adventurers, wouldn't we?
Okay, okay, I'll leave it at that.
......? Adventurer!
Ah, Mr. Adventurer!　Welcome back. <cf> Did you get the "[shioma]chi clam"?
Yay! <cf> So this is the real clam!
Okay, okay!　All we need is this: ......
Now all I need is for Roddy to eat them and <cf>Merith's love will come true!
Hey, Katya!　Hey, Katya!
Actually, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>That clam has a special meaning.
They are called "Shiohitachi clams" because they come from the "Shiohitachi beach", and not just a simple name like that.
They are said to resemble a maiden longing for her lover as they patiently remain on the beach until the tide comes in.
So, there is a legend that if you feed a "shiomaichi clam" to someone you love, it will bring the girl's love to fruition.
Mellis has been looking for clams ever since I told her about it.
But still, clam chowder, huh? <cf>That's a good idea, since you need clams. Melis.
I'm sure this will go over great with you and Roddy.
<span size="Big">Don't talk all the way! </>
Katya fool!　Mean!　You happy-go-lucky person! <cf>Anta's good though, because you have Yoan!
Yes, yes, I'm sorry. <cf>I'll make you clam chowder with me!
Muuuuuuhhh~!
Hah ...... already. Anyway, thanks, adventurer. <cf> I'll take good care of the [shioma]chi clams.
I'll definitely feed them to Roddy and <cf>make some progress!
I'll make the clam chowder, but <cf>what am I going to say to Roddy to make him eat it?
[Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it! Eat it!"] wouldn't make an impact, and <cf>[eat it!
Or, better yet, ......[ahhhhh]? <cf>Cow!　What should I do, what should I do?
Oh, dear! <cf>The sheep we raised so carefully have been turned into bandits......!
If we don't do something, we'll be in big trouble! <cf>We must find her as soon as possible!
<cf>Mr. Adventurer! <cf>You're the adventurer who helped Elsie, aren't you!
Yes, I am Elsie, the butcher! <cf>You must find her!
My name is Lasse. <cf>I am a scholar who studies and promotes animal husbandry!
<cf>Elsi and I are from the same hometown, and we are neighbors. <cf>I used to watch her study.
Perhaps because I was learning about animals and animal husbandry, <cf>Elsi's passion for livestock was ignited. ......
As you know, Elsie's love for livestock is very linear, <cf>and once it starts, it never stops!
When it comes to livestock, <cf>she just can't seem to put the brakes on!
This time, sheep raised in Lalpar were attacked. <cf>The culprits are bandits!
You understand, don't you?　Yes, <span size="Big">they are humans</span>!
If we were dealing with monsters, but if <cf>Elsi started running in her usual fashion</cf> against humans, we'd have to go to ......!
Please! <cf>Please look for Elsie with me!
Larpal's sheep have been attacked by bandits. <cf>If we don't, we're in big trouble!
Let's look for Elsi! <cf>If we don't find her quickly, the bandits will be in danger!
Ah!　The adventurer who always helps us! <cf>It's a big problem!
The bandits have bullied the sheep! <cf>He's so cute and useful, and even tastier!
With their fuzzy hair, milk for cheese, <cf> and meat that tastes great boiled or baked,<cf> ......
Oh, you bandit!　No. ......
<span size="Big">Humans the unforgivable! </>
Don't talk like an evil emperor!
Huh?　Brother? <cf>It's Brother Russe, isn't it?
It's been a long time, Elsie. <cf>I'm glad to see you haven't messed with the bandits yet.
I see that your brother is also with you to punish the bandits! <cf>Sooner, quicker, quicker, quicker battle!　Let's go!
No, the bandits are really in danger if we don't do something. <cf>We have to distract Elsie somehow: ......
Oh, yes!　It hit me!
Actually, Elsie. <cf>The idea that the bandits attacked the sheep is a misunderstanding.
The real culprits are elsewhere. <cf>I know that very well.
Heh?　What do you mean, brother?
<cf> Recently, I've been researching sheep as livestock. <cf>I really needed a specimen for that.
<cf>I saw a docile sheep nearby. <cf>A poor lamb, kept and tamed by man.
Even an athletic little guy like me could catch it in a second. <cf>Yes!　So it was me who attacked the sheep!
They were victims of my research! <cf> Hahahaha!
Oh, no ...... brother ......!
Okay, if I'm the culprit, <cf>even Elsie won't hesitate ......
<span size="Big">Brother the unforgivable! </>
<span size="Big">Wait, wait, wait! </>
Don't hold up a natural beef knife! <cf>And I taught you not to point it at people!
Because your brother bullied the sheep!
That's just a figure of speech, <cf>or perhaps the truth is shown not by words, but by actions.
Then again, it was the bandit!
I can't say ["]yes["] because it would blow away all the hard work I've put into it, <cf>I guess I can't say ["]yes["]!
<span size="Big">Which is it! </>
Hey, whatever it was, it got Elsie's attention! <cf>Adventurer, it's now or never!
The bandits are in the "Arsenal of the [Arsenal], Free Search" in the [Exiled Country]! <cf>Adventurers, please go and defeat them!
Please hurry! <cf>There is a limit to how much I can hold Elsie back!
<cf>Elsi, no matter how much it's for the sake of the livestock and the other party is a villain, it's not a good idea to defeat them without question!
I don't understand what your brother is talking about because it's difficult!
I'm sure I'm preaching rather natural human things, <cf>but maybe I'm teaching you wrong!
Anyway, adventurer!　It's now or never!
While I'm drawing Elsie away, <cf>please go to the [arsenal] in [exile] and defeat the bandits in your free exploration!
Please do!　I won't be around that long either. ......
Hey, adventurer? <cf> Where have you been?
Defeat the bandits in the [arsenal] of the [exiled] ......? <cf> What does that have to do with the sheep?
What?　Didn't brother Russe bully the sheep?
Why such a lie,...... brother!
(It's all for your own good, Elsie ......)
Ha!　I heard your brother's voice from somewhere: ......
(You wouldn't listen to me if I didn't do this, would you? <cf> You've always been like that. Oh, how I miss it......)
Brother!　Such ......! <cf> You were a good man. ......
[--]No, he's alive.
Oh, brother. You're safe.
I exerted all my physical and mental strength until I passed out, so <cf>I'm not as safe as you say, okay?
You shouldn't be at your desk studying all the time. <cf>Eat meat every day and exercise properly!
<cf>You, I think I'll cut back on swinging the beef knife for a bit. <cf>I don't think you need to be so fast that your sword muscles disappear.
Thank you, adventurer. <cf>Thanks to you, I managed to get it under control.
If it weren't for the adventurer, it would have been dangerous in <cf>every</cf> way!
Yes, it is dangerous to fight with bandits. <cf>Your brother stopped Atashi, didn't he?
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>Yes!　Since we're here, I'll treat you to a sheep!
I'll have to go and rustle them up as soon as I can! <cf>Wait a minute, both of you!
As usual, Elsie is in good spirits. <cf>It's a good thing. It's a good thing, really. ......
Now if only we could put the brakes on our love for each other just a little bit: ......
Anyway, we are lucky that there were no human casualties. <cf>Please keep up the good work Elsie!
Elsie's enthusiasm for livestock is amazing. <cf>I even respect you for that!
Just a little bit of brake would be nice ......
Hah...... the meat Elsie has been rustling up for me,<cf> delicious as always......
Work, work, work! <cf>Do you labor too?
It's good to have a job! <cf>It's not good to have too much free time in your long life!
<cf>Many of my friends are laid back, though. <cf>I mean, even some of the forest folk like to work.
I am Kynarl, <cf>Restorer of the Buffalian heritage!
<cf>A restorer of the forest folk is a rarity, no? <I'm probably the only one in the whole continent.
I've been taking tools apart and putting them back together for a long time.
I like new and different things. <cf>I don't mind the traditions of the forest, but I'm also curious about outside cultures.
That's why I took a boat over to Asterlys, <cf>to train as a restorer.
<cf>and opened my own business here in Jubilia. <cf>Buffalian heritage is not used in the forests back home.
<cf>In Jubilia, on the other hand, the village is growing, so there is a lot of work for restorers!
<cf>The situation on the Magna continent is different from here, and it's interesting. <cf>They don't have enough tools and materials for restoration, so we have to be creative. ......
...... is not the time to talk about that!
Actually, I'm in a rush right now! <cf>To be honest, I'm in a bad situation because I have a job that is due soon!
<cf>I'm so busy that I've run out of materials. <cf>I'm so busy that I don't have time to go stock up!
So, can you please go get me some materials? <cf>"Hekiri-ishi" should be available at "[Shiotai]-chi [Hama]".
It's an ore that can only be found in this area. <cf> It shines well with the power of engrams.
It's also a heritage lamp that I'm restoring, and <cf>'Hekiri stone' would fit in nicely.
How to restore it by substituting materials that are available. <cf>That's where a restorer's skill comes in: ......
So, this is not the time to talk!
Hekiri-ishi" can be found at "Shiotaichi-Hama. <cf>Gather eight for now!
I'll take care of the other work! <cf>Now, hurry up, hurry up, work!
<cf>Gather eight Hekili stones at "Shiotai" and "Hama" in Cape Rawehara!
I can't meet the deadline if I don't! <cf>Please help me~!
Oh, you brought "Hekili Stone" for me!
Oh no, you saved me! <cf>I just got my other work done.
Now I can meet the deadline, man. <cf>Now, let's finish the last restoration!
This is the heritage lamp you asked for. <cf>It looks like a rather odd mold.
<cf>It's a very unusual type, and the inside is completely different from the other lamps, so <cf>we started by finding out how to repair it!
<cf>It took me a long time to find the "Hekiri stone. <cf>But this kind of trial and error is the fun part of the job!
Speaking of fun, this lamp. <cf>It doesn't just light up the lamp, you know?
I don't know where it is, but <cf>it projects a view of another place on the wall!
If you light this lamp in a dark room, <cf>it instantly transforms the room into a faraway exotic landscape!
It's an amazing legacy, isn't it?
I'm curious to know how it works and <cf>where it's from...<cf>I'm excited!
Oh yeah, speaking of curious. <cf>It seems that this guy came from Ullau.
Ullau is a settlement of forest people, <cf>buffalic heritage is not supposed to be brought there.
This is a heritage lamp that was in such a place. <cf>And it comes with a contraption that locks in the exotic scenery!
Duh, I'm curious!
Maybe an adventurer like you will <cf>someday solve the mystery!
Thank you!　If you <cf>find a heritage site that needs restoration, let me know and I'll take care of it!
Oh no, all sorts of heritage restorations are brought in. <cf>That just makes it more fun!
Take it apart, put it back together, and think again ....... <cf>It's great to not be bored!
I wonder if <cf>everyone did this back in the days of the Buffalian civilization.
I know it wouldn't fit the forest people's idea, but <cf>as for me, I'm jealous of the old people!
The forest people are used to hunting. <cf>because they've been chasing prey in the woods since they were young.
Many of them are hunters in Jubilia as well. <cf>And we're not so good at business and all that.
Hunters are not only hunting prey, <cf>but also preparing for monsters.
Those of us who can handle weapons, like us, <cf>also have a responsibility to protect our villages.
I am Hohoi, a hunter from Jubilia. <cf>Thank you for accepting my request.
Recently, our hunting party was attacked by a series of monsters.
The attackers were earth sky fish. <cf>I hate to say it, but they are not tough prey.
And yet, even the most skilled of my hunting companions were attacked.
The people of the forest are accustomed to hunting. <cf>Because they grow up hunting in the forest from an early age.
<cf>My father was the same, and I myself <cf>learned everything from the basics of hunting from him.
Even my father, such a father, was unaware. <cf>And he said the strangest things.
He said, "["]I didn't hear any earth skyfish ["]<cf>. <cf> He said he didn't hear any noise at all, and it caught him off guard.
The other fellows are saying similar things. <cf>But they are forest people, too.
<cf>It is hard to believe that they all missed the sound of their prey, <cf>as forest dwellers.
So I'm going to find out what's causing this. <cf>If this continues, the village will be in danger.
A hunter is not only responsible for hunting his prey, but also for protecting the village from monsters.
I want you to go to the [shioma]-chi [hama] and kill about four earth sky fish.
I want you to <cf>see for yourself if you really can't hear them.
With my skill, I can't <cf>confirm</cf> the sound while protecting the village. I'm sorry.
Come back to me when you have finished defeating them. <cf>Thank you for your time and effort.
I want you to go and take down about <cf>four</cf> earth sky fishes in [[Shiotai]chi[hama]].
My friends say they didn't hear a sound, but I want you to make sure that's true.
I'm sorry, but I'm counting on you.
I see you took down the earth skyfish. <cf>Thanks for the help.
My friends said ["]they didn't hear a sound["], <cf>did you?
...... From the looks of it, it doesn't seem to make any difference. <cf>It looks like they could hear the sound too.
I see. So the cause must be my father and <cf>his friends.
Actually, there is one thing I'm wondering about.
I checked to see if anything had changed recently, and <cf>my father was buying jewelry.
The continent over there, ...... the Magna continent, huh? <cf>He bought it from a merchant in the city you came from.
He said he was going to give it to me <cf>to add a little color to my lack of prettiness.
Well, let's put my father's feelings aside. <cf>The problem is the jewelry.
I brought it out earlier, but <cf>it has lost its luster and is dull.
But when my father bought it, it shone beautifully. <cf>And just before you returned, the shine was gone.
Furthermore, the time when your friends were killed by the earth skyfish and <cf>when my father bought the jewelry coincide.
I find this jewelry suspicious. <cf>I would return it to the merchant if I could.
I heard that there is a liner coming into the harbor. <cf>Would you please search for the merchant with me?
I am not good at recognizing people. <cf>I would appreciate it if you would follow me.
I want to find the merchant who sold me this jewel. <cf>I think I can find him at the port.
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Is there something you need?
Something you want to ask me about gems? <cf>What gemstone is it?
This gemstone. <cf>It was purchased by a hunter of the forest people.
Ah, this gemstone! <cf>Good, I was looking for a customer!
Actually, after I returned to Asterlys, <cf>I found out something terrible!
I came back to Jubilee <cf>in a big hurry, because I wanted to tell my customer!
What do you mean? <cf> Is there something about this gem?
Yes, there's a lore about it. <cf>Wait a minute, I've transcribed it.
'I leave a note about the five-colored gemstone that brings a curse.
"The five-colored gem, though it may be divided, <cf> flows in search of its other half.
"The white gems keep sound away. <cf>The white gems keep sound away, muffling the sound of sound and bringing absolute silence.
That matches the fact that my father and his friends were killed without a sound, <cf>and that the light went out after you had defeated them.
You, the merchant. <cf>So you are saying that this is a cursed jewel?
I am sorry, I had no idea. <cf>I will take it back here and now.
Of course, we will return the payment, and <cf>we will leave the jewelry with the Pioneering Bureau.
No, you are not at fault. <cf>Thank you for your honesty and confiding in me.
I will let my father know what happened. <cf>It's also clear why our friends got hit.
Maybe there was pride on our part. <cf>Now that we know that, we can't dismiss the gems as evil either.
Anyway, let's give this one back. <cf>I hope there will be no more commotion.
<cf>Yes, sir. <cf>We will certainly take it back.
I have taken care of you as an adventurer. <cf>Thank you for all your help.
<cf>There are many forest folk who are not worldly-minded. <cf>We are glad to have someone like you to help us.
<cf>If you are called upon to help in the forest, <cf>please lend them your strength.
<cf>We are not well trained to get carried away by a single gem
It's not just our hunting skills. <cf> We must also train an unwavering heart.
Here we are, Cape Lawehala! <cf> Hmmm, I think I have a good idea!
Anne. It's not free to come here. <cf>Save your money, because we owe you travel expenses, too.
Shea's already worrying so much. <cf>Hey, hey, I'll pay you back the travel expenses in a heartbeat!
I'm more worried about <cf>spending it all at once on some strange idea: ......
Welcome to the new product development of inventors Anne & Shea! <cf>Adventurers are all too familiar with you!
We're always so glad to hear from you, adventurer. <cf>I've finally made it across the sea!
Wow, it's hot when you get to Cape Lawehala! <cf> It's so different from Asterlys.
Now, isn't there anything you want more when it's hot?
Yes, I do. <cf>I'd love to have something cold to drink.
Tch tch, that's a common idea, Shea! <cf> Ideas are always hidden behind common sense.
When it's hot - something warm! <cf>Not just food or some other boring idea, but something with a [twist]!
Let's make a luxury down quilt!
Did you come up with the idea of a down quilt because of this heat? <cf> Just thinking about it makes me sweat.
That's right. Sweating well is good for your health, and <cf>you'll feel refreshed!
Oh, I'm not going to sell it here, as you'd expect, right? <cf>We'll sell it in a cooler place like Canalor, so it'll be fine!
Plus, it's a very popular comforter with the kids. <cf>What do you think?　A new point of view, right?
Popular with kids?　What's the logic?
It's, you know, a mind pecker!
Have you ever seen one, adventurers? <cf> A bird-like monster with a bland face.
And if you don't make it angry, it's surprisingly friendly. <cf> They sing in funny voices, and they're cute little guys.
They're in picture books and <cf>designed on children's products and stuff.
As for me, I think they have the <cf>potential</cf> to fight with Nappo-kun and Yee-chan, too!
Um, Anne?　It's a down quilt, right?
Yes, it's a comforter made <cf>full</cf> of Mindpecker feathers!
It's fluffy, warm, and feels great against the skin! <cf>It's like sleeping with a Mind Pecker!
Kids play with Mind Pecker too, <cf>because they can have happy dreams!
No, the important thing is that the Mind Pecker is <cf>feathery. ......
So, adventurers! <cf>I need you to go gather some materials.
Get <cf>"Talking Bird Feathers" from the Mind Pecker at "[Shiotai]chi [Hama]"!
Hah ....... I'm afraid I can't <cf>persuade Anne to go into this mode.
I'm sorry, adventurer, but I'm going to need <cf>10 copies of "Feathers of the Talking Bird", please.
I will pay you properly.
You can get <cf>"Talking Bird Feathers" from the Mind Pecker in "Shiotai-chi [Shiotai], Hama [Hama]".
First of all, 10 pieces for a prototype! <cf>Thanks for your help, adventurer!
Anne, as always, <cf>thanks for your help!
We're running out of money for the trip, but we'll be sure to pay the adventurers separately.
Ah, welcome back! <cf>You've finished collecting already?　That's great!
It's "feathers of a talking bird" as requested. <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
You did it, thank you!　<cf>Now you can make the very popular feather quilt!
First of all, you have to unwind these feathers ......, huh? <cf>Is this what bird feathers look like?
It seems <cf>more fluffy</cf> in a comforter. ......
It's <cf>mainly waterfowl breast feathers that are used in duvets!
It has high heat retention properties to keep the body cool in cold water, and high moisture release properties to keep the <cf>hair moist.
With the feathers of birds that live in hotter regions, everything is the opposite!
And the fibers are so strong, <cf>I'm sure they'll poke through the duvet!
Then again, feathers penetrating fabric is not such a good idea ......
<span size="Big">Ouch!　It stung! </>
Please don't hurt yourself, not anymore......
Adventurer, thank you so much <cf> for hanging out with Anne!
As usual, you stopped at ideas. <cf>I hope you learn before you get hurt. ......
Damn!　It's only a bird's feather! <cf> Rub it scruffy and it should soften up in time!
<span size="Big">Gosh, gosh, gosh, gosh! </>
Wait, what kind of speed are you rubbing at! <cf> You're generating smoke!
A hot flame of passion is essential for the development of new products! <cf> Look, look, you're burning up!
You really don't need to flame up! <cf> Let go of me, you'll burn yourself!　Anne!
It hit me!　Why don't we put the whole mindpecker <cf>in the comforter?
Then we'd have the perfect comforter! <cf>Okay, let's go get him!
There's no way I'm going to stay quiet! <cf> Come to your senses, Anne!　Stop ...... stopping!
Long ago, in Cape Rawehara, <cf>there was a god different from the Buffalian gods.
[It's called the "Sea God" and it's still an old belief.
The "Sea God Cave" and the "Cave of Kahuna" are sacred places where <cf>Wadatsumi is worshipped and prayers are offered.
Adventurers should also remember to thank the sea from time to time. <cf>[God of the Sea] watches over us from beyond the sea.
Adventurers from across the sea. <cf>Please lend me your strength!
My name is Mimiolina. <cf>I serve the gods of Cape Lawehala.
And when I say god, I don't mean the god of Buffalia, <cf>I mean another god that has been handed down in this land for a long time.
[<cf> "The Sea God". <cf>This god protected Cape Lawehala in the olden days.
It is because of the blessings of the Sea God that the people are blessed with seafood, sea breezes, and mild weather.
Although the Buffalo-Brazilian religion is the mainstream now, there are still people who believe in <cf>[the Sea God] in this land.
I am one of them. [I am one of those who serve the Sea God, and <cf>in the old language, we are called 'kahuna'.
We kahunas are responsible for praying to the sea god and offering offerings to him from time to time.
However, it seems that these precious offerings have been destroyed by <cf>monsters</cf>.
It seems that the Gilmy Warrior in Tsukikakushi's Valley of the Moon has <cf>taken the offerings. ......
There are places in that area that are important to the <cf>Wadadami's Cave</cf> and Kahuna's Cave</cf>, which are important to the belief of the Sea Gods.
<cf>As Kahuna, I can't allow Gilmy and the others to ravage them!
Please!　Please defeat the Gilmy Warrior and return the <cf>Offerings to the Sea God</cf>!
The Gilmy Warrior in Tsukikakushi's Valley of the Moon should have the <cf>Offering to the Sea God</cf>.
I can't allow you to take away something so precious to the [Sea God]. <cf>Please take it back!
You took back the "Offering to the Sea God," didn't you? <cf>Thank you so much, adventurer!
Oh, I'm so relieved. <cf>I must pray to the [Sea God] once again!
[<cf>I know he had a rough side, too. <cf> You see, the sea is not always calm, right?
In the olden days, it was believed that storms and maritime disasters were brought about <cf> by the wrath of the sea god.
[The Sea God protected this land, but he also brought hardship and trials.
At such times, the god of Buffalia appeared, calmed him down, and appeased his anger.
[The god left the land in the hands of the Buffalian gods, and returned to the other side of the sea.
<cf> This is a fairy tale passed down in the Buffalian religion. <cf>The local lore is a little different.
In fact, it is said that a village girl offered herself as a sacrifice to appease the wrath of the <cf>[sea god].
<cf>Since then, we have been making offerings to the Sea God. <cf> so that we will not need sacrifices again.
From the kahuna's point of view, it is a little disappointing that <cf>[God of the Sea] has left us. ......
I am sure he is still watching over Cape <cf>Lawehala</cf> from across the sea.
I wonder if the adventurers who crossed the sea were sent by <cf>Master God of the Sea</cf>.
If so, I'm kind of glad. <cf>Thank you for helping me. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
May the sea bless you, adventurer. <cf>I pray that the sea will help you.
May the [sea god] bless you, adventurer. <cf> May the blessings and mercy of the sea be with you.
The God of Buffalia is a great being, but please remember <cf>[God of the Sea]'s will from time to time.
Jubilee is becoming more and more crowded.
However, as the city grows larger, <cf>problems sometimes arise.
<cf>Security can deteriorate, <cf>new diseases can spread, etc.</cf>.
Apparently there was a time like that in the forests back home. <cf>I guess it pays to be prepared.
Hey, welcome to Jubilia. <cf>Are you enjoying yourself?
My name is Maurili. <cf>I'm one of the people of the forest, but I like it here so much that I've decided to stay.
Our home is in the forests <cf>further into the outer continent</cf> from here.
Many of the forest people live there, but <cf>the odd ones like me</cf> come out of their homes.
<cf>The winds of Jubilia, where I can live with humans, <cf>somehow suits my skin.
<cf>This Jubilian wind has been giving me a bad feeling lately.
I wonder if it's the feeling of the people of the forest. <cf>On occasion, I get a hunch about these things.
Usually when something bad happens in the village.
Some people were coughing, <cf>apparently an epidemic is coming.
I am also an apothecary. <cf>Because of my job, I'm especially sensitive about illnesses.
I want to make medicine before the epidemic starts in earnest. <cf>I need some help from adventurers.
I need you to go to "Ia Mole [reef]" and gather materials. <cf>It's called "Tamarulu Grass" and "Stirrup Seaweed.
Five of each will suffice for now. <cf>I want you to look for plants and water points.
I'll get the other materials and tools ready. <cf>Before the disease really takes off, please.
I want you to collect materials at "Ia Mole [reef]". <cf>"Tamarulu grass" and "Abuku seaweed.
Five of each will suffice. <cf>I want you to try to collect plants and water points.
Before the disease really starts to take hold, I'd appreciate it if you'd do me a favor.
Hello, adventurer. <cf> I see you've collected the ingredients for the potion.
Thank you very much. <cf>I think we can control the epidemic now.
I'll get the medicine ready as soon as I can. <cf>With the number of residents increasing, we'll have to figure out a way to mass produce them.
It's good that Jubilia is getting bigger. <cf>But with that comes problems.
The more people there are, the more commotion there will be. <cf>Such as diseases like this one, or crimes.
It seems that there was a time like that in the homeland of the forest people. <cf>When they used to accept people from the outside.
Jubilia is actively accepting people, so <cf>it wouldn't be surprising if the same thing happened there.
If that's the case, our forest people's experience and insight <cf>might</cf> be of some use.
<cf>We humans and forest people are living together. <cf>We should join forces with each other.
Thank you very much. <cf>I'm glad to have the help of adventurers as well.
<cf>I hope we can all continue to work together for the development of Jubilia.
<cf>Although some people are getting a little sick, <cf>the disease outbreak is under control in the village as a whole.
The medicine seems to have worked. <cf>I guess that's a relief for a while.
<cf>You're traveling too? <cf>Me too!
I'm going to Barnhart now, <cf>to join the Knights and be very active!
<cf>I'm going to go to Barnhart and join the Knights and do great things! <cf>I heard there's a guy from the Knights somewhere ......
My name is Joel!　I'm a traveler!
I'm not a runaway!　I'm a traveler! <cf> Make no mistake about it.
You adventurers travel all over the place, don't you? <cf>I love it, I love being an adventurer.
<cf>But that's not what I'm here for. <cf>I want to go to the Principality of Barnhart!
<cf>I'm going to join the Order of Barnhart and do great things!
If I do that, my father and mother won't be able to scold me.
So, I want to make connections with the Order.
<cf>I'm sure there are people from the Order of Barnhart in the village, and <cf>they'll listen to me if I have an adult adventurer with me.
Let's find someone from the Knights first. <cf>Good luck!
I think someone from the Order of Barnhart is in <cf>Jubilee</cf>.
With an adult adventurer with him, <cf>he'll listen to what I have to say!
<cf>I need you to help me find someone from the Knights of Barnhart. Please!
Hmm?　Huh? <cf> You!　You're the adventurer from back then, right?
Don't you remember? <cf> We were Barnhart's former deserters!
Ah!　Thanks for that occasion. <cf>I'm sorry for taking care of you.
<cf>You helped me with my luggage, and <cf>you rescued my partner from the monsters.
We're going back to the Order and starting <cf>from scratch</cf>.
We're starting over with menial tasks and chores. <cf>Don't worry. I won't run away again.
Hey, are these the guys from the Knights? <cf> They don't even have swords. Aren't they from around here?
What's with the kid?　Are you lost?
My name is Joel! <cf> I'm here to join the Order of Barnhart!
Huh?　You're here to join the Order? <cf> Don't do it, don't do it. You kids go play with your friends.
That's right, there are some scary instructors out there. <cf> Come when you're older.
No, I'm definitely joining the Order! <cf>If you guys can get in, why not me?
<cf>I'm not going to desert! <cf> I'll be a better knight than you!
What the hell, you little brat!
Well, there are kids like this from time to time. <cf>How do we get them to leave?
No, no, no, Lucas. If you're going to go that far, <cf> let's give them a taste of what it's like to be a knight-errant.
We'll show them how hard it is to be a knighthood!
Henshin, I wish! <cf> If you do your job properly, we'll get you into the knighthood!
Oh, it's getting tedious. ...... <cf>Sorry, adventurer. I need your help again.
I'm sure Klaus won't be too reckless, but <cf>I'll feel better knowing you're keeping an eye on me.
Alright!　Let's start with a look around. <cf>Let's go check the village to see if there's anything out of the ordinary.
That's a piece of cake!　Let's get the hell out of here!
Sorry to drag you into this. <cf>We'll follow you two.
Let's take a look around first. <cf>Let's go check the village for anything out of the ordinary.
Easy peasy!　Let's get the hell out of here!
Oh dear. ....... Sorry, adventurer.
I'm worried about these two alone. <cf> You can come with me.
All right, kid!　Let's start looking around. <cf>What do you notice?
Nothing. <cf> I think there's garbage all over the place and it looks messy.
Oh, you see trash, too, huh? <cf> So what do you do with the trash?
You don't do anything with it. <cf>I didn't throw it out, so it's none of my business.
Too bad, you little shit! <cf>Cleaning up trash is also a noble job of the Order!
Keep the village beautiful and clean! <cf>Of course, cleaning up is part of the job!
Ehhh~!　That's not cool!
Don't mess with me!　Here, let's do it!
Phew!　I guess I'll just have to do it!
Okay, thanks for the help! <cf> You did a good job of cleaning up after all that complaining.
You're surprisingly honest, Joel. <cf>Maybe you have a chance.
Hey, let me do a cooler job! <cf> If you're a knight, you're on a mission to fight.
Don't you think you heard that somewhere?　Klaus.
Ugh, shut up!　I'm sorry about that time.
I can't take you down, but can you at least <cf> manage to take me on a scouting mission?
Yes, I think so. We could just watch from afar.
All right, kid! <cf>Next is scouting for monsters.
Scouting is a task that requires a lot of intelligence. <cf>Will you show me that fighting is not your only skill?
<cf> Yes, of course!　Of course I will! <cf> I'll do a great job of scouting!
Did I say that? <cf>Well then, let's race to Ia Mole!
I'm sorry to keep coming back to you, you know. <cf> Come with me to Ia Mole.
Next, we'll go to "Ia Mole [reef]" to scout for monsters. <cf> Leave it to me!
Hey, don't go ahead! <cf>Don't ever get too close to the monsters!
Can you come to "Ia Mole [reef]" too? <cf>If the monsters come after us, we can't handle it!
We can't let Joel get hurt. <cf>Lend me a little more strength.
Oh, aww... ....... <cf>Monsters are so many of them!
Hey, calm down, man. It's all right. <cf>If you stay here, they won't attack you.
<cf>This is a little unexpected. <cf> We found some Gilmeyers on our reconnaissance mission.
There are more of them than reported. <cf>It's too dangerous to approach that thing with kids.
If it was just us, <cf>we can't put this kid in danger.
<cf>Go ahead and take care of it!
The Knights aren't supposed to run away! <cf>We're going to fight and get rid of the monsters!
Shut up and think about it! <cf>We can't win if we're unarmed!
<cf>The work of the Order involves danger! <cf>Safety first is the most important rule of all!
If you get hurt, it would be a disgrace to the Order. <cf>You understand that, don't you?
Uh-huh. Okay. ......
We'll take the kid back. <cf>In the meantime, I need you to take down Gilmey.
If you draw them away, <cf>we can get out of here safe and sound with the kid.
Sorry to put you through the wringer again. <cf> I'll apologize as much as you want later.
Klaus isn't the only one. <cf> Let me get my head out of my ass.
Anyway, the priority is to evacuate Joel. <cf>We're going back to Jubilia.
Let me join you in Jubilia! <cf>You're strong enough to handle it, I'm counting on you!
The safety of this kid is our top priority. <cf>We'll take him and evacuate to Jubilia.
<cf>You take down Gilmy and draw their attention to us.
<cf>Thank you for all the trouble you've been giving me. <cf>Please take care of him!
Thanks for your help! <cf>You took down Gilmy.
I knew you were awesome! <cf> You're still going strong after all that fighting.
The Knights are asking adventurers to take him down. <cf>The Knights are stronger, right?
Klaus has messed with monsters before and <cf>run away!
That's where this adventurer saved me.
Ah, that's a shameful memory. <cf> But it's true, so it can't be helped.
So you're saying that adventurers are more awesome than knights?
Not really. <cf>It just means that we all have our roles to play.
We did our part to protect you from danger. <cf>We ran, you fought.
It's not about who's better. <cf>Well, maybe it's cooler to fight.
I want you to see <cf>the way of life of the knights</cf>, not <cf>the strong knights</cf>.
The way of life of the Order: ......
You ran away from home anyway, didn't you? <cf> Go talk to your mom and dad first.
I'm one of those people who ran away from home and all the bad things, <cf>and it didn't do you any good at all.
Not the kid ......, but the traveler Joel. <cf>Your first duty is to talk to your parents!
If you can't do that, you can't <cf>name yourself Joel of the Order!　Wahaha!
Hey, what the heck! <cf>All right!　I'll go talk to them!
If Dad and Mom say yes, <cf>I'll do the knighthood with you guys!
Oh, okay!　Come anytime!
Oh dear, looks like I've managed to get it all settled. <cf>Thanks for your help too, Anta.
Klaus seems to be getting more aware of the knighthood. <cf> All of this is thanks to meeting you, Anta.
You're helping all kinds of people besides us. <cf>Good luck on your journey then!
Hey, hey, what are you doing today? <cf> Picking up trash?　Fix the wall?
I'd like to join you! <cf> Let me train to be a knight!
Oh, God!　Shut up! <cf>You never get tired of coming here, day after day.
What's the matter, I've missed you so much. <cf> Well, it's the job of the Order to protect the dreams of the boys, isn't it?
Oh, kind adventurer. <cf>We meet again.
Thank you for your help on that occasion. <cf> See, you got rid of the corpse, didn't you?
Have you seen Mr. Koshimo since then? <cf> I haven't seen him.
Ummm. Please don't look at me like that. <cf>It was a "pig corpse" that you threw away.
<cf> Or did you imagine something else?
Hmmm. Well, we can talk about that.
Actually, there's something I'd like to <cf>concern</cf> you about, Mr. Adventurer.
<cf>I'm having trouble receiving an item from a blacksmith that I've come to know well.
He is a small blacksmith in Kanaroa, but he forges <cf>good blades</cf>.
He never delays his work and is <cf>very reliable!
I'd like to visit him, but <cf>I'm not sure if it would be wise for a child to go alone, right?
We may need the help of an adventurer, <cf>so why don't you come with us?
Adventurers don't leave children in trouble, do they?
Of course, if nothing else, that would be best. <cf>Uh-huh. Well then, I look forward to working with you.
I'm a little troubled <cf>because I haven't received any goods from the blacksmith in Kanaroa!
I'd like to go check on them, so <cf>will you join me?
If you are having trouble, <cf>we could use the help of an adventurer.
<cf>Thank you very much.
Oh, welcome. Adventurer.
I would say ......, but I'm sorry. <cf>We're not taking any new orders right now.
It's been a while, master. <cf>We're always happy to help you.
Oh?　It's Niki, isn't it? <cf>You came all the way from Asterlys?
Yes, I did. <cf>I thought it was unusual for you to delay a delivery like this.
I was wondering if something was wrong.
<cf>Thanks for that. <cf>It's nice of you to patronize a poor workshop like ours.
Sorry about that, though. We're in a bit of a pickle, <cf>we can't produce anything satisfactory.
Our warehouse has been attacked by proto-machina. <cf>They uprooted all the blacksmithing tools.
I've been using them for years, and they've grown accustomed to my hands. <cf>The quality of the alternative tools is inevitably lower.
We're trying different things, but they're far from what we can offer to our customers.
Did the protomachina take your master's tools?
<cf>The blacksmith's tools alone, with no attention to the others?
Yes, the materials were still there. <cf>So I can handle the blacksmithing itself.
<cf>That's a problem. <cf>At this rate, we'll have to think about closing the business.
Don't be so hasty. <cf>With your skills, there's nothing to worry about.
Besides, if we get our tools back, <cf>there won't be any problems, will there?
There are adventurers we can rely on, <cf>we'll discuss it with them.
That's very kind of you, but ......<cf>we're dealing with a proto-machina.
The adventurer is still a child, <cf>Niki is still a child. Don't be reckless.
I understand. <cf>I'll just get it over with in my own territory, sir.
Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Would you like to have a little chat over there?
If you get your blacksmithing tools back,<cf> we can do business as before.
It was the proto-machina that took my tools. <cf>It's not something an amateur can do anything about.
Adventurer, you're going to have to talk to Niki. <cf>She's got something to tell us.
<cf>Don't be too reckless. <cf>Niki is just a kid, you know.
Well, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>I've heard something that's been bothering you.
<cf>Protomachina can attack people. <cf>But it does not take people's tools!
Such a thing would <cf>not</cf> be of any benefit to the protomachina!
But if there is someone who is a business rival of the master, <cf>that person will surely benefit!
Did you know that the Knights of Barnhart <cf>utilize</cf> the Machina as an asset in their warfare?
That's because they have the technology to control the Machina. <cf>Naturally, it is a military secret and cannot be used by outsiders.
However, even the best-kept secret can be leaked to the outside world.
For example, if a person who was in the Order <cf>fails and becomes a brigand,<cf> he or she will be able to use the technology to control the Machina and the Proto-Machina. ......
they might be able to <cf>manipulate the machina or proto-machina.
Of course, these are my guesses. <cf>I'm not talking about anything definite.
So I will look into that. <cf>I was thinking of asking the adventurers for a proto-machina.
I have just looked at the master's warehouse. <cf>[PM (proto-machina)]You found traces of mooks.
It seems that <cf>[PM (protomachina)]Mook</cf>, who is in the "Abandoned Mines of Noxious Miasma, Free Exploration," has taken the master's tools.
Adventurers, could you please go to the "Abandoned Mines of Miasma, Free Search" and defeat <cf>[PM (protomachina)]Mook.
If you do so, you should be able to retrieve your master's tools.
I will excuse myself for a moment. <cf>I have an idea about the 'human' one.
I will go and talk to them for a while. <cf>When you are done, please tell your master. Good bye.
<cf>[PM (proto-machina)]Mook, who is in "The Abandoned Mines of Miasma: Free Exploration," seems to have taken my master's tools.
Adventurers, can you help us take him down? <cf>I think I can get my master's tools back.
I'll visit another place I have in mind. <cf> I'd like to have a word with you.
When you defeat [PM (proto-machina)] Mook, <cf>please tell your master and reassure him.
Oh, adventurer. <cf>What's wrong?
This is my blacksmithing tool, isn't it? <cf>You got it back for me?
<cf>Thank you! <cf>But where on earth did you find it?
<cf> But where the hell did you find it?　Niki told you to go and kill the <cf> protomachina</cf>?
<cf>That's a lot of trouble for you. <cf>Niki is a reckless person, isn't she?
<cf>But what if they come again? <cf>There are limits to how sturdy you can make a warehouse. ......
No need to worry about that one, sir.
Good work, adventurer. <cf>I see that you were able to put away the proto-machina.
Oyasama. The monsters won't appear anymore, and <cf>nothing will happen to hinder your business!
Please put your mind at ease and go about your business.
Is that so? <cf> Well, I'd appreciate that. ......
Did Niki do something for you?
No, it's thanks to the adventurers who <cf>defeated</cf> the proto-machina!
Nothing from me. As long as you do your work smoothly, that's all that matters.
The blades you forged are first-rate. <cf>I'll be waiting for you to deliver them again.
Yes, I understand! <cf>We've got our tools back, and we're back in business.
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>If you ever have any blacksmithing needs, just let me know!
Thanks to you, we've solved the problem. <cf>Thank you, adventurer!
The proto-machina would have been <cf> left untouched if nothing had happened to it!
It was defeated because of human involvement. <cf>It is not the adventurer's fault, of course, but
<cf>Humans are much more frightening than monsters and the legacy of Buffalia. Don't you think so?
But those who were hiding in the background <cf>did not come out into the open as they were.
It seems that the master's work was an eyesore, <cf>but it was a bit much.
Hmmm. You have such a scary face. ...... <cf>You are a terrible person, adventurer.
It's as if I'm the one being called <cf>terrible ...... on top of terrible things!
I just needed to do my master's work, that's all. <cf>I would have been in trouble if someone had interfered with me.
<cf>A tool that fits in your hand is indispensable for your work. <cf>Didn't you say so, master?
<cf>Trying to take them away from people is not something to be admired.
Be careful, adventurers. <cf>Please take good care of both people and tools.
<cf>See you later. <cf>Good day to you, kind adventurer.
I used to fight a lot of fools in the arena.
The building itself is a legacy of Buffalia, <cf> and you can train by fighting all kinds of monsters.
<cf>The monsters are recreated just like in Imagine. <cf>I don't know how it works, man.
[You can fight monsters in the outer continent. <cf>That makes it a good training facility.
'Cape Lawehala Expeditionary Training Supplies<cf>Asterlys Security Forces.
'Supplies for long-term expeditions. <cf>Please handle with care."
<span size="Big">"Don't come back until you take them all down! </>
[--]The intense heat seems to be coming through. <cf>But is it okay to leave supplies behind?
When I see Eubank, the guard captain,<cf> I'll let him know just in case.
Hey, it's you! <cf>You're getting better and better at this, aren't you?
I wish my men in the Guard would grow up to be as good as you!
<cf>I'm just now getting them trained for an expedition. <cf>I sent them to Cape Lawehala.
<cf>However, they seem to be having a bit of a hard time. <cf>Wow, that's pathetic. Can you give me a hand with this?
Oh, thank you. <cf>Well, to put it simply, I'm going to raise my men.
<cf>Well, in a nutshell, it's just a training exercise to bring up my men.
There are a lot of enemies and sand underfoot. And it's hot. <cf>An ideal environment for training, right?
Of course, don't come back until you kill them all! [I told him <cf>that I'm not going to come back until I've killed them all!
They really don't come back at all. <cf>It looks like they're having a hard time defeating them.
It's fine if they don't come back. <cf>It's also a good thing that they don't leave the town empty forever.
Huh?　<cf> A box with supplies for the expedition is left at the port?
What does that mean? <cf> They're training without adequate supplies?
They're good, aren't they? <cf>If that's how they've stuck with it so far, then I'm impressed!
Wait a minute, isn't this good training? <cf> If we leave them alone, they'll learn to have a lot of guts, won't they?
Hahaha, just kidding! <cf> But running out of food is a bad situation.
Being hungry is the worst situation. <cf>For once, my men did a good job.
<cf>Well, let's get this over with, shall we? <cf>First, let's meet up in Jubilia.
Maybe we'll clean up the monsters we missed, though. <cf>We'll talk about that when we get to Jubilia.
My men are on an expedition to <cf>"Shiotai" and "Hama" at Cape Rawehara.
We'd better get them out of there, since they don't seem to have any supplies.
Let's go to Jubilia for now. <cf>We'll see what we can do there.
Hey, thanks for your hard work! <cf> We found our men in training for the expedition.
They were exhausted. <cf>At least we've retrieved them and are letting them rest.
Well, I heard they fought without eating or drinking. <cf>Well, you can give them a little credit.
<cf>They got rid of the monsters, and it looks like the people in the village were saved.
Recently, there was a sudden increase in the number of two types of monsters, the Swan Plizzard and the Ignis Lizard.
Since the training coincided with the expedition training, they had to deal with both of them at once.
They didn't let them near the village, but it was impossible to kill them all.
I would have taken care of the rest, but <cf>I couldn't cover them all by myself.
I'm sorry. I need a little help from you too.
Would you take out 10 Swan Plizzards and 10 Ignis Lizzards each from Shiotai and Hama?
I'll go destroy their nests in the meantime. <cf>Leave that to me. <cf>I'll take care of that!
If we pull the guards out like this, we might damage Jubilia.
We need to clean up after our men. <cf>I'm sorry, but we need your help too!
<cf>Swanplizzard and Ignis Lizard,<cf> I need you to take down 10 each.
<cf>They should be the ones from Shiotai and Hama. <cf> In the meantime, I'll go destroy the nest!
Ta, thank God you're here. ...... <cf>You came, Captain~......
Oh, even the supplies. ...... <cf>I knew you were the best captain~......
I can't move anymore......
Hungry, I'm starving......
Oh, you, thank you! <cf>You kicked the Lizard's asses.
We smashed their nests, too. <cf>You made it an easy mon.
Jubilia can rest easy now. <cf>I told everyone you did it!
Now, let's get our men back home. <cf>I'll even feed you on the liner.
<cf>For once, I think I'm getting the better of you. <cf>These guys are pretty good, aren't they?
They're still worth training, and <cf>the more you do it, the stronger you'll get!
All right!　<cf>I'll exempt you from swimming home, but there are a lot of things you can train for on the boat!
Sleep well today, boys! <cf>I'll get back into it tomorrow, too!
Oh, you're you! <cf> You took care of me in Jubilee, too.
Expeditionary training was a good experience, man. <cf>My men are getting their guts back in gear.
I think it's time to throw them out into the desert. <cf> If the beaches are okay, we can make it!
Doubtful. I doubt it, those two. <cf>So suspicious.
<cf>They're always fighting when they see each other, yet they meet up every time they have to run an errand.
If they really disliked each other, they wouldn't have met in the first place. <cf>That means ...... that, by any chance?
The captain asked me to get some materials for him.
'Overweight steel plate', huh? <cf>It's not something that's readily available.
<cf>I should consult with the Order of Buffalia. <cf>The Order and the Order have a cooperative relationship.
I hope there are some left over over there. ......
I've been asked by a senior priest to procure <cf>materials.
It's "overweight steel plate,"<cf>but it's not something you can get right away.
I have no choice. I'll consult with the knighthood. <cf>We often exchange supplies with each other.
I hope there is a surplus over there. ......
Hello, adventurer. <cf>If you are free, could you do me a favor?
It's about our Captain Vilmer and <cf>Anelma, the priestess of Buffalia.
<cf>They are suspicious, these two. <cf>Seriously suspicious.
<cf>They fight all the time when they see each other, but <cf>it seems like they are conscious of each other!
<cf>Would you please cooperate with us a little bit to find out the truth?
Thank you very much. <cf>Maybe there will be an adventurer's turn.
I'm good friends with <cf>Mr. Anelma as well as Captain Villmer.
<cf>They're both so hard-headed that they don't know how to give in to each other.
Every time we meet, we get into a fight, and <cf>I'm caught in the middle every time.
But you know what? <cf>The more they fight, the better they get along,<cf> they say.
Even Captain Vilmer, who is always tsk-tsk-ing, is also ...... on the inside. <cf>Even the super cool and cold Mr. Anelma is really ...... in his heart!
Wouldn't it be fun if it were like that!
I was just thinking about it, and then the two of them called me <cf>each</cf>!
Just in time, I thought I'd <cf>explore</cf> them on the sly.
Let's start with Captain Villmer, shall we?
I'm sure he's making the rounds of Barnhart Castle, so <cf>I'm sure we can find him somewhere.
He's going to give us a lot of trouble anyway, so <cf>let's get the unpleasant stuff out of the way first.
Captain Vilmer and Anelma, <cf>he says, are definitely suspicious!
<cf>They've just called us, so let's go and check them out while we're on our business.
Let's start with Captain Villmer. <cf>He should be inside Barnhart Castle.
Oh, here you are at last, Scherni. <cf> What, you're with us, adventurer?
<cf>We are grateful for your help the other day, Master Adventurer. <cf> My men will give you trouble anyway, but please take care of them.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You could <cf>promote your men a little more, Captain.
And you know what, Scherni? <cf>I have a favor to ask you right away.
I don't want to.
<cf>Get me the "overweight steel plate". <cf> You can carry it to the castle for me.
If you defeat [PM (proto-machina)] Dogolman Beta type, <cf> you should be able to get it.
I just don't know where they are. <cf> Sorry, but I'm asking you to start looking for them.
No, you're not listening to me at all! <cf>Why are you assuming we're going to take it on?
And what's with the 'overweight steel plate'? <cf>That thing is so heavy!
That's why I called you in. <cf>You're the only one available in the unit right now.
<cf>You're pretty handy for a guy like you, asking for help from an adventurer beforehand.
I knew you were going to give him a hard time! <cf>After all, I've been invited by Anelma too!
<span size="Big">A-ne-ru-ma-da~? </>
Oh, no. I gave out her name.
Hey, come on, Scherni! <cf>I hope that woman didn't give you any ideas!
She had nothing to do with this! <cf>She's got nothing to do with this!
<cf>Gather up the "overweight steel plates" quickly! <cf>This is a captain's order, understood?
<cf>This is a captain's order! <cf>"Overweight steel plates", yes, yes!
Oh, God. I just <cf>hear Anelma's name and she's like that.
<cf>I've taken care of the "overweight steel plate" thing too. <cf>As usual, he is arrogant. Captain-dono, arrogant~!
I can't help it. <cf>Let's go ask Anelma about her business too.
<cf>She said she was at the castle, so I'm sure she's nearby.
I'll collect the "overweight steel plates" that the captain asked for later.
Let's go and see what Mr. Anelma wants. <cf>She's at the castle, so I'm sure we'll find her soon.
Thank you for your visit. <cf>Mr. Scherni, and Mr. Adventurer, too.
Hello~, Ms. Anelma. <cf>I've been invited to join you~.
I've been forced to do something troublesome by the captain, and <cf>I'll take care of Mr. Anelma's business in a flash~!
<cf>Mr. Villmer? <cf>Hasn't he started making unreasonable demands again?
He has a high-handed attitude toward Ms. Scherni. He should change his attitude.
If it is difficult for Mr. Scherni to refuse, I would be happy to offer my support, even if it is only a small contribution.
Wow, only <cf>Mr. Anelma would take my side like that!　How kind of you!
...... I'm starting to feel like <cf> you're a waste of a captain's life.
I'm sorry to be the one to do this, but <cf>could you please do me a favor?
I would like you to <cf>collect</cf> a material called "overweight steel plate".
Huh?　You are also in need of "overweight steel plates"?
Yes, I have heard that there are people in need of it. <cf>The Church has found no surplus.
I know that you can find them in the "Mines of miasma and free exploration" on the "Stahl Coast", but what kind of monsters should we kill?
<cf> but we did not know exactly what kind of monsters to kill.
Maybe the [PM (proto-machina)] Dogolman Beta type. <cf>So that's what I was told.
I see. Then, could you please <cf>"overweight steel plates"?
Please deliver about five of them to the castle. <cf>I will also rely on the merchant's [connections]. Good bye.
Hmmm, two people asking for the same thing. <cf> Such coincidences do happen, don't they?
But <cf>[PM (proto-machina)]Dogolman Beta type' in 'Free Search in the Abandoned Mines of Miasma' is a troublesome opponent!
I'm glad I asked the adventurers to do it. <cf>I'm sorry, but please keep me company.
Defeat <cf>[PM (proto-machina)]Dogolman Beta Type</cf> at the "Miasma Abandoned Mine, Free Search" at "Stahl Coast" and obtain 5 "Overweight Steel Plates".
When you are done, come back to Barnhart Castle. <cf>Then we can start the mission!
<cf>Defeat [PM (proto-machina)] Dogolman β-type at the "Mired Mine, Free Search" on the "Stahl Coast" and obtain 5 "Overweight Steel Plates".
Once completed, return to Barnhart Castle.
Sorry for all the trouble, <cf>Thank you!
Ha, ha ......, Mr. Adventurer ....... <cf>Thank you for collecting the "overweight steel plates" ......
Ahhh, I can't do it anymore!　<cf>Why do I have to carry such a ridiculously heavy thing by human power~?
Excuse me!　I've come to check on the "overweight steel plates" from the military research institute.
Laboratory?　Is that perhaps the people from the research institute who were looking for the "overweight steel plate"?
Yes, I am. We suddenly needed them, but we didn't have any left at the institute.
We asked the Barnhardt Knights and the Order of Buffalia to <cf>procure them respectively.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with ....... <cf>That's exactly 5 pieces. Confirmed.
Then I will come back later to collect them. <cf>Thank you for your cooperation!
I see...that's how it works~. <cf> So the request went to both the Knights and the Order.
And both Captain Vilmer and Ms. Anelma <cf>wanted to prepare "overweight steel plates" for each other.
Oh, Cherni. And you, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your efforts.
Thank you very much. <cf>Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Scherni and Mr. Adventurer.
You mean, you!　Anelma! <cf> Why are you here!
Why are you here, Vilma?
Both the captain and Anelma wanted <cf>"overweight steel plates" </cf>.
So I had an adventurer help me to get them. <cf>A few minutes ago, someone from the research institute came to check on it.
<cf>At the same time, there is one thing that concerns me!
Neither you nor Anelma were directly requested by the institute, right?
I think it was just something you overheard, so why did you go to the trouble of asking me?
Because I heard he was in trouble.
I heard that Mr. Villmer was in trouble.
Heh~?　Oh~?　Hmm~! <cf>It's a strange coincidence, isn't it?
<cf>When I heard that you both wanted it, I tried to prepare it for both of you~!
And you did it in secret, without telling the other person!
Isn't this already a gift? <cf>Hey, hey, hey!
<cf>What's that smirk on your face? <cf>It's just a procurement mission, nothing more!
Anelma in the first place!　Why did you ask Scherni to do it? <cf>You could have just told me to procure the materials!
It's no use asking <cf>Mr. Villmer for what he's looking for!
We will deliver the "overweight steel plate" to you, <cf>Mr. Villmer can have it!
I don't need it!　You needed it, so <cf>you take it!
I was told that you were looking for it, Mr. Villmer. <cf>I am not happy to have it for you!
<span size="Big">What...oh? </>
Here we go again. <cf> Really, I never get tired of how many times we fight.
Thank you very much, adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry I asked you to do so many things.
As for me, I'm very satisfied! <cf>I now have more material to tease the captain with.
<cf>Now, how should I get the two of you involved next time? <cf>You're not being honest at all~, grin!
<cf>I think you and Anelma would make a good match.
<cf>They're both interested in each other, but <cf>they're not being honest, they're just alike!
I don't know how to put them together! <cf>I'm not on a mission anymore!　grin
Hey, um, you know what? <cf>Could you show me the way?
I want to go to Jubilia, across the sea. <cf>So, I was thinking we should go to the ocean first.
If there's lots of water, it's the ocean, right?
It's okay, the ocean is big! <cf>No way I'm getting lost.
<cf>Thank you!　I won't get lost this time!
The ocean is the ocean, but there's no harbor or landing place <cf>I ran towards the cliffs: ......
Do you know of any lost adventurers named Pissarri?
If you know of him, I'd appreciate a little help. <cf>As usual, I don't know where he went.
<cf>I've done a lot for her, so if she's in trouble, I'd like to help her out.
<cf>Thanks for taking me on. <cf> Hmm?　You know Pissarri?
You been lost a few times? <cf> Hahaha, you're still the same!
Pissary is a good adventurer, you know. <cf> A lot of guys have been saved by that kid.
Whenever someone is in trouble, she'll wander in from somewhere and <cf>help</cf> people out.
Usually in the middle of getting lost.
I've had to give directions and help out a few times myself. <cf> I was just about to return the favor one of these days.
Rumor on the wind is that Pissary is wandering <cf> around here and there, doing something he wants to do.
Sorry to be the one to ask, but <cf>you</cf> might be able to help her out?
I'll be grateful. Just finding Pissary <cf> is going to be a lot of work. ......
A farmer in Minsterhorn was in <cf>Pissary's</cf> care the other day.
Listen to the story and retrace your steps. <cf>Thanks for helping Pissary as it is.
I'm asking you. <cf> I'll pray for the blessings of the Buffalian gods on you and Pissarri.
The farmer in Minsterhorn might know where Pissary is.
Listen to what they have to say and try to retrace their steps.
If you find Pissary, I hope you can help him. <cf>She's got something she wants to do.
I'm asking you. <cf>Blessings of the Buffalian gods be upon you all.
Oh, adventurer. <cf> What can I do for you in our fields?
Oh, you mean Mr. Pissary? <cf>Yes, he helped us the other day.
My son is a budding adventurer. <cf>He slipped while searching for "Claw marks of the Giant Dragon.
He was surrounded by vicious monsters when <cf>Mr. Pissarri passed by.
So he kicked the monsters out of the way in no time and saved <cf>my son!
It was in the bushes where no one would ever come, so <cf>my son was amazed!
I wanted to thank him, but he <cf>[had] something to do[,]" and left early.
I don't know where I'm going. ...... <cf>I don't even know if he's where I'm headed.
Oh, that's right. I left a thank-you gift for Mr. Pissary at the <cf>Asterlys Pioneer Station</cf>.
It may have already arrived. Why don't you ask the <cf>Pioneer Bureau</cf>?
I left a thank-you gift for <cf>Mr. Pissary</cf> at the Settlement Bureau in Asterlys.
Maybe they have received it. <cf>If not, you may still hear from him.
If you ask the staff at the Pioneer Bureau, <cf>I'm sure they can help you track down Mr. Pissary.
Thanks for your help, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your constant cooperation with the Pioneer Bureau!
Do you have a question? <cf>Yes, what is it? We'll take care of it.
Is it the footsteps of Mr. ...... Pissary? <cf> Well, I haven't seen you around lately.
I have an accumulation of thank you letters and rewards that I haven't received,<cf>and I'd like to see your face here.
Mr. Pissary has a tendency not to sit still <cf>when he sees someone in need.
He does everything <cf>from fighting, gathering, crafting, and survival, and he can solve any kind of trouble!
Many people have been helped, and the Pioneer Bureau even tried to give <cf>Mr. Pissarri</cf> an award!
But she got lost and couldn't <cf>come to the award ceremony!
Let's see, Mr. Pissary's recent disappearance is at ......
Oh, and you received a thank you from a merchant in Canaroa. <cf> He said that Mr. Pissary gave him some precious medicinal herbs.
If you ask the merchant, you may be able to find out <cf>Mr. Pissary's whereabouts.
Huh?　You saved the newcomer in "Claws of the Giant Dragon" and <cf>delivered the medicinal herbs to Canaroa right after that ......?
What kind of route would <cf> I be able to travel in such a short period of time? ......
I recently met Mr. Pissary, <cf>a merchant in Canaroa.
If you talk to him, I think you can get a better idea of <cf>Mr. Pissary's whereabouts.
If possible, I would suggest that you go after him as soon as possible.
Once Mr. Pissary is gone, even <cf>the Pioneer Bureau's search party won't be able to find him. ......
Hi, welcome. We <cf>are</cf> happy to have you as an adventurer, and we'll be happy to help you out.
You helped us just the other day. <cf>Your name is Mr. Pissary.
Eh?　Are you looking for Mr. Pissary? <cf>Oh, that's just great!
I also wanted to thank you for your help. <cf>Please find her!
The other day, I was in need of some medicinal herbs, and <cf>Mr. Pissary walked by.
<cf>He left me a lot of them because he happened to have some with him!
It was really a great help to me, because it was very precious and could only be found on the cliffs, far from human habitation.
......I wonder why he collected such a large amount of medicinal herbs?
Anyway, he left <cf><cf><cf><cf>with something to do</cf><cf><cf> without thanking me.
I don't know exactly where he is, but <cf>those herbs are found near the desert.
Mr. Pissary may be <cf>based</cf> in Salamzat.
It's a very crowded place, so why don't you look for them in <cf>Salamzat</cf>?
Mr. Pissary may be based <cf>in Salamzert!
I'm sure there are many people there who have seen him or helped him <cf>.
Salamzert is a long way from here, but <cf> there, well, Mr. Pissary is ......
Um!　Um!　Could you please tell me the way?
I want to go to Jubilia, but I'm lost! <cf>I thought I was going for the sea, but I can't find it anywhere!
...... What?　Did you get a request to help me? <cf>Worried about whether Panayote and the others were lost?
Well, yes, we are lost, but ......<cf>I thought it would be okay this time!
Jubilia is across the sea, right? <cf>Then why don't we just go to the ocean?
You don't think I'd go to the ocean and get lost!
I'm actually lost, so yeah ....... <cf>Not very convincing, yes. ......
Okay, then again! <cf>Can you tell me how to get to Jubilia?
Gosh, I'm sorry!　You <cf>taught me very clearly, but I still didn't understand!
Sigh. You know, I'd like to give flowers to someone in Jubilia who <cf>has</cf> been very kind to me.
I know I'm silly, but could you <cf>take me to Jubilia?　Please?
I just want to go to Jubilia, but <cf>I feel like I'm going a very long way ......
I'm sorry. Please take me <cf>stupidly</cf> to Jubilia: ......
If I walk any further alone, I'm afraid I'll go from <cf>worried</cf> to annoyed to annoyed to put it on everyone else: ......
Tsk, I'm here!　Jubilier!
Wow, thank you!　Thank you so much! <cf>It was a long way~!
You just made it farther by getting lost yourself, yes. ......
But now I'm finally going to get what I came for.
I want to dedicate my flowers to someone. <cf> I wanted to go to "Ia Mole [reef]".
But I heard some bad news. <cf>"Gilmy Warlord" is raiding that area.
I have my own purposes, but the villagers are in trouble too, and <cf>I can't just leave them alone!
I'm sorry I got you into this! <cf>But I need your help too!
Let's <cf>split up and take down the Gilmy Warlord of "Ia Mole [Reef]"!
Don't worry!　I'll be right under your nose! <cf>I won't go this way and that without your permission!
<cf>Six Gilmy Warlords at a time! <cf>You and I will have an easy time, come on!
I need to go to Ia Mole, but <cf>Guirmie Warlords are tearing it up!
It's dangerous for the villagers and we'll get rid of them!
Don't worry!　I won't go away without permission! <cf>I can take down the Gimme Warlord!
<cf>Thank you very much! <cf>Thank you very much!
<cf>Thank you very much! <cf>I'm glad the sea was so beautiful and calm.
The man is a senior adventurer whom I look up to. <cf>He saved me when I was a little kid, when I was lost.
He wasn't extremely strong or at the top of his game like Jake.
But he did everything he could <cf> to help those in need.
I <cf>tried so hard to be an adventurer like him.
But he died before I could catch up.
<cf>There weren't many adventurers in Jubilia during the pioneering period, and he was reckless to protect everyone from the monsters.
That's just like that guy, though. <cf>You could have waited a little longer.
But it's refreshing to be able to give him flowers. <cf>I thought again that I'm going for that guy after all.
Eh?　A pioneer station full of thank-yous addressed to me? <cf> And you said there were other people who were grateful?
<cf> I'm glad to hear that! <cf>I'm embarrassed, but I'm doing my best in my own way.
<cf>I'll keep on being an adventurer, I'll keep on doing my best! <cf>Even a lost child can do it!
I'll do it!　Oooh!
<cf>I can't help but get nervous when I get an order from the Order of Buffalia.
If I deliver a bad one, <cf>it'll be like blasphemy.
I get scolded even if I don't mean to. <cf>Mistakes are strictly forbidden in the Order's orders.
I delivered a <cf>sword</cf> ordered by a guard of the Order of Buffalia.
It seems to be a ceremonial one. <cf>It's a fine sword, beautifully decorated.
However, I mistook this sword for <cf>another</cf> sword and ......
Hey, peddler! <cf>What's going on with the sword I ordered?
You didn't mean to <cf>deceive me by selling me a cheap one, did you?
If you don't get it in time for the ceremony, <cf>you'll be disgracing the face of the god of Buffalia!
It's not a disaster! <cf>There's just been a slight mistake!
The sword you ordered will be delivered immediately! <cf>Please wait just a little longer!
There's really only so long you can wait, you know. <cf>God sees everything.
There's no room for lies and deceit! <cf>If you don't make it in time, be prepared!
It's been like this all along. <cf>The cultists are tense because it's a sword used in a ritual.
We have to retrieve the 'ceremonial armored sword' as soon as possible!
<cf>The other sword, the one we got mixed up with, was ordered by an adventurer. <cf>I'm going to go see that person now.
But the adventurer said he was going to <cf>"Galley Ridge Abandoned Road.
Isn't that area dangerous? <cf>I can't move by myself.
That's why I need you to escort me. <cf>I need your help to retrieve the sword.
I'll do the negotiating, thank you.
<cf>I gave the wrong "ceremonial sword" to the adventurers. I will retrieve it immediately.
<cf>Since you said you were heading for the "Galley Ridge Abandoned Road,"<cf> I need you to escort me there.
I need your help until I finish retrieving the sword. <cf>Please do.
<cf>We're in the same business, aren't we? <cf>Are you exploring around here too?
Huh?　<cf> I think I recognize that merchant over there.
Thank goodness I found you! <cf>I've been looking for you!
<cf>I sold you a "ceremonial sword", didn't I? <cf> I'm afraid I mistook it for the real thing.
Oh, I see! <cf> I thought it was a very fine sword for the price.
Perhaps you came to collect it?
Yes, I am. <cf>It's for a Buffalian ritual, so I had to get it to you right away.
Oops. ....... Sorry about that. <cf>I don't think I'll be able to return that sword.
You know "The Hidden Mines of Tomdrum?" <cf> They say it's where the bandits' hidden treasure lies.
I came here for the treasure, <cf>but I screwed up when I went down there to check it out.
I got caught off-guard by Flame Lapis and <cf>dropped my sword</cf>.
Oh, no!　So the "ceremonial sword" is in <cf>Flame Lapidus' territory?
That's what I'm saying. <cf>Well, with my abilities, it was all I could do to escape.
I've lost my weapon, and I'm just trying to get back on the road.
<cf>By the way, though, it's all about Buffalian rituals. <cf> I'm gonna get in trouble for that.
Hey, you. Would you <cf>get me back my ceremonial sword?
<cf>I'd rather you do it than me, who's unarmed. <cf>You seem to be much more skilled than I am.
I'd like to ask you to do the same!　<cf>The Order won't wait any longer!
You're the only one I can count on! <cf>I want my 'ceremonial armored sword' back!
Done. Flame Lapis should be found in <cf>"Hidden Mine of Tomdrum, Investigation".
If you go deep enough, you will get back <cf>The Sword of Ritual</cf>.
I will escort this merchant to Larpal. <cf>Take care of the sword for me!
<cf>I think I can find Flame Lapis at the hidden mine in Tomdrum.
I want you to retrieve the <cf>Sword of Ritual</cf>!
I'll go back to Larpal first. <cf>If you can retrieve it, you come right back too!
Thank you, adventurer! <cf>I see you recovered the "Sword of Ritual".
Yeah, it's definitely this sword. <cf>Now I can finally deliver it!
Oh, isn't that a wonderful sword? <cf>It was worth ordering.
I'm sorry to have caused you so much worry. <cf>Please, take delivery!
Mm, indeed. <cf>The gods of Buffalia will be pleased.
<cf>Thanks for your efforts as well, adventurer. <cf>Well, I have some ceremonial preparations to make, so here goes.
Hah~ thank goodness. <cf>I don't know what I would have done without you.
The people of the Order could have used a little extra work. <cf>Let me thank you again from me.
You <cf> helped me not to be disrespectful to the Gods of Buffalia.
I know there are many ways to think about it, but <cf>I still respect God.
And it's an honor for a <cf>merchant</cf> to be inquired about by the Order.
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. <cf>I'll be very careful next time.
<cf>It's an honor for a merchant to be inquired about by the Order of Buffalia.
I know I have to be careful, but <cf>I'm still glad to be of service to God!
Luggage is scattered all over the place.
It bears the markings of the Merchant's Association of Lalpar and the Pioneer Bureau. <cf>I wonder if they ever carried them deep into the [outer continent (gaikoku tairiku)].
In addition, the package is torn up quite messily: ......
You might want to report it, just in case. <cf>Let's retrieve the packing slip!
Ah!　Adventurer, that luggage tag! <cf> May I see them?
The Merchant's Association of Lalpar and the Pioneer Bureau ....... <cf>It has the markings of both. Where did you get this?
[In the "Gekikakushi no Yūkoku" in the "Outer Continent"? <cf>How in the world did you end up in such a place ......
Um, Mr. Adventurer. <cf>Will you do me a favor?
This package was jointly prepared by the merchants of Ralparu and the <cf>Pioneering Bureau</cf>.
The contents are "starry sea silver," a special type of silver used in the <cf>Baphalian Order's festivals.
<cf>Each grain resonates with the stars in the heavens. <cf>It is a rare ore with such a legend.
It was robbed while being transported.
<cf>According to the merchant who was the victim of the robbery, <cf>the perpetrators were a very powerful armed group.
<cf>They were well organized for bandits, yet their methods were extremely aggressive.
And, strangely enough, they paid no attention to money or goods other than the "Hoshikai Silver.
The Pioneer Bureau also followed the trail, but <cf>we had no idea</cf> it had been transported to the Outer Continent. ......
<cf>We have to get the "Star Sea Silver" back anyway. <cf>Please lend me your help, adventurers!
First, let's head to Jubilia. <cf>We will gather information there and decide on a course of action.
The stolen cargo is "Hoshikai Gin". <cf>They were robbed by a vicious armed group.
<cf>We don't know why it was taken to the outer continent, but we need to get it back anyway.
Let's head to Jubilia first. <cf>I will head there myself. Thank you in advance.
Thank you for your hard work, adventurer. <cf>I asked the locals about the whereabouts of the "Star Sea Silver".
It was a reasonably large package, and <cf>it seems there were people who witnessed it.
Conversely, they carried the stolen goods <cf>with impunity</cf> without worrying about being seen. ......
The destination of the armed group seems to be a place called <cf>"The Cave of Kahuna".
The place where the adventurer found the package was also <cf>near there, wasn't it? I am sure of it.
However, since then, we have not seen any group of people in the vicinity of "Kahuna's Cave".
Have they already disappeared? ......
Adventurers, could you please conduct <cf>"Kahuna's Hollow Additional Investigation" and retrieve the <cf>"Star Sea Silver"?
I'm sorry, I can't help you in battle. <cf>And I'm a little concerned about something.
<cf>"Kahuna's Cave" is one of the sacred places in this land that remains in the belief in the <cf>"Sea God".
And "star and sea silver" is a special metal used in <cf>Baphalian rituals.
It is said that in the past, the priests of the Buffalian faith tried to hear the voice of the God in the heavens through the "Star Sea Silver".
It is a legend, but it is also a fact that it is still <cf>traditional in the cult's rituals.
Is there any connection with the armed group? ...... <cf>I can only imagine, but I'll look into it.
Please send me a copy of "Kahuna's [cave], additional research". <cf>If there is any danger, please do not take any chances.
It is enough for me if I can get back the "Star Sea Silver".
The armed group that robbed the "Star Sea Silver" seems to have headed for the "Cave of Kahuna.
I think we can recover the "Star Sea Silver" if we conduct "Kahuna's Cave: Additional Investigation".
The armed group has not been seen since, and <cf>may have already fled.
Adventurers, please take it easy. <cf>If you find it dangerous, please leave.
Welcome back, adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your hard work investigating "Kahuna's Cave.
Ah, this is "Star Sea Silver", isn't it? <cf>I'm sure it's what was taken from you.
<cf>Thank goodness. <cf>Did you find any other clues?
I don't know the details of the situation. ...... <cf>Okay, thank you.
Let's not pursue this any further. <cf>I will raise a detailed report with the pioneering bureau.
Who was it and what was its purpose? <cf>I can't shake the spooky feeling ......
I too have <cf>learned a lot from the villagers!
<cf>The kahuna of the Kahuna Cave is a kind of priest or priestess in the belief in the <cf>Wadutami, the God of the Sea.
And, <cf>there is an even more important sacred place, the "Cave of the Sea Gods," at the back of the "Kahuna Cave.
<cf>The Kahuna used to make offerings to the place, and <cf>sometimes the voice of the sea god would be heard there.
It is similar to the legend of "Hoshi Kai Gin", isn't it?
The culprits tried to use the "Star Sea Silver" to <cf>hear someone's voice in the holy land, or something like that?
Sorry. <cf>Talking about it here leaves a lot to the imagination.
The "Star Sea Silver" has been recovered safely, and <cf>that's the end of the case for now.
Thank you so much. <cf>Everything is thanks to you, adventurers!
Please continue your <cf>help to the Pioneer Bureau and the citizens!
Jubilia and Asterlys can come and go by <cf>liner, so that's a big help!
This is a <cf>bustling town, unlike the life of the forest people!
I may not be used to living here, but I <cf>love</cf> visiting!
Well, I guess my kind of thinking <cf>would be an oddity even among the forest folk!
Hi, I'm Caponono. I'm a forest folk living in <cf>Jubilia.
I come to <cf>Asterlys sometimes on a liner.
I came here today to try my hand at fishing.
I befriended an adventurer who came to Jubilee before, and he gave me <cf>the legacy of Buffalia</cf>.
It's supposed to be useful for catching fish of any kind. <cf> But I've never fished before.
What do you think?　Wouldn't you, an adventurer, <cf>have an idea?
Hmm, doesn't ring a bell? <cf>It would be nice to have someone who knows more about it.
Oh, it's rare to meet a fisherman of the forest folk. <cf>Good meet you!
My name is Andor. I try to promote fishing. <cf>I'm here to help if you have any questions.
I'd appreciate that. <cf> Actually, a friend of mine gave me this Buffalo legacy.
He told me it would be useful for fishing, but <cf>I don't really know how to use it.
Hmmm, may I take a look? <cf>Which one is it: ......
Looks like it's some kind of lure. <cf>It's called a pseudo-bait, you know?
Oh, you mean the stuff that's made to look like bait. <cf> I hear expert fishermen use them to fool fish.
Yes!　And this legacy seems to <cf>move the lure all by itself!
Perhaps you can just throw it into the ocean and <cf>make it move as good as the real thing!
Hoho. Does that mean we can catch fish <cf> without using bait?
Yes, but it's been used a lot. <cf>It would be better to repair it.
I think "Thunderbird Feathers" would give it a <cf>good</cf> finish!
<cf>"Thunderbird Feathers" is a material of Lightning Pecker, isn't it? <cf>They should be in <cf> "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku".
I'm sorry to make you go through all this trouble, but <cf>could you please go and collect about four of them?
My human friend gave them to me. <cf>I want to use them in a proper way.
<cf>It seems that I need "Thunderbird's Decorative Feathers" to repair the legacy of Buffalia.
You should be able to get it from <cf>Lightning Pecker</cf> in <cf>Yuukoku</cf>.
I'm sorry to take your time, but could you please collect about <cf>four</cf> of them for me? Thanks in advance.
Hey, thanks. <cf>You collected the "Lightning Bird's Decorative Feathers" for me.
Lightning pecker is on land and <cf>the feathers are useful for fishing? Curious.
Hey, welcome back! <cf>It looks like you got all your materials in one piece.
Well then, let's repair Mr. Caponono's legacy. <cf> Leave it to me!
Okay, that's good! <cf>And while we're at it, I've got a rod for you, too.
I hope you enjoy fishing with it! <cf>Your friend will be pleased!
Thanks for everything. <cf>It's good to see someone so kind.
Some of the forest folk don't <cf>like</cf> the company of humans.
I seem to have met <cf>good people, both my friends and yours!
As I cast my line, I will think of those I <cf>have met.
If you meet the forest folk, I hope you'll walk up to them. <cf> They're just not used to people being nice to them.
Fishing is a very deep thing. <cf>And you get to meet a lot of people.
I've made a lot of fishing friends. <cf>I don't separate the humans from the forest folk.
Yeah, I'm glad I started. <cf>You should enjoy fishing once in a while too!
Right-okay!　Left OK! <cf>No abnormalities today, safety check complete!
Mm, [familiar]. [<cf> I'll get used to it, that's the new name! <cf> Across the sea, I've been reborn again!
Come on, shout to that sea! <cf> I am the One Man Armyyyyyy!
Across the sea we meet again, my rival!
After all, my fate and yours are unbreakable. <cf>Even if we are separated by a great sea!
Then you have no choice but to apply. <cf>Yes!　Let's compete once again in a new land!
<cf>Let's see you show your strength before me, the one-man army!
<cf>Oh, don't be in such a hurry. <cf>I'll tell you what I'm going to do, even if you're in no hurry.
I'll tell you why I call myself a one-man army!
But I will not reveal it to you so easily! <cf>You know that, don't you?
The place of the game is "Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku" (The Valley of the Hidden Moon)! <cf> We must defeat the monsters there!
Gilmy Shaman and Gilmy Sage. <cf> You can try to defeat them all at once!
I took down 14 of them each! <cf> You can't get past me if you can't take down 15 of them!
<cf> You are truly a one-man army, taking on two types at once!　I'm afraid of myself.
Let's get started!　The strong man sits and waits! <cf>I await the outcome of your battle!
<cf>The battle will be won by defeating the monsters in Tsukikakushi no Yūkoku! <cf>The targets are the Gilmy Shaman and the Gilmy Sage!
Can you kill 15 of each? <cf> If you can, you win!
<cf>To take on both of them at the same time is exactly what a one-man army looks like!
<span size="Big">What the hell? </>
You've already defeated Guillemie and the others? <cf>No way, that's too fast!
Hold on a minute!　I'll go check it out!
Geez ...... geez ....... They really did take them down. <cf>Sorry, sorry I doubted you.
That's you!　Gilmy Shaman and Sage, <cf>you managed to kill 15 of them all together!
<cf>You are truly a one-man army! <cf>A warrior in solitude who can fight alone!
<cf>I'm all alone too. <cf>I proudly bore this name!
The one who can fight like an army even if he is alone! <cf>One Man and Army!　That's who I am!
If I had been a One-Man Army back then, <cf>that puppy that was hungry and whimpering, <cf>I'd be a One-Man Army ......
No, nothing! <cf>One Man Army is a symbol of loneliness!　No regrets!
But I don't need two one-man-armies. <cf> After all, he's a one-man man.
If there were two, the sign would be false. <cf>I will gladly hand over the one-man army position to you!
It was beyond my power. <cf>It seems your one-man army is of a different caliber!
<cf>I'm impressed!　<cf>You should be proud of your ability to fight through the loneliness!
Well then, farewell!　Next time I won't lose! <cf>Strive in solitude and isolation, my rival!
[<cf> Changing your environment in the Outer Continent has been a good workout for you.
Let's change it up a bit more. <cf>Since we're here, let's venture deeper into the continent!
The forest folk have all sorts of lore. <cf>Some of them are actually useful!
<cf><cf>Whenever we're short of ore or other materials, they say, <cf>[ask the blue crystal flower]].
I've been a big help sometimes too. <cf>Maybe he can help you on your journey.
Hey there!　Welcome to the site! <cf>You're the adventurer, right?
Thanks for taking me up on the offer! <cf>The people in the township seem to be busy with various things, thank you very much!
<cf>The monsters in the forest have been raging lately. <cf>Orders for weapons have suddenly increased.
Thanks to that, I've been holed up in the workshop from morning till night. <cf>I'm so busy that I don't have time to go to the forest.
<cf>We're running out of materials.
And that's where you come in. <cf>Will you go to the "Silent Forest" to collect ore?
What I want is "duro ore. <cf>At any rate, if we have five pieces, we can get by for the time being.
As I said before, the forest is noisy now. <cf>Monsters are running amok, so be careful, okay?
If you want, I can lend you some of my weapons. <cf>...... No, I don't think that's necessary.
<cf>You're using a nice weapon. <cf>A weapon that feels good in your hand is the best!　Sorry for meddling.
I'll leave you to it. Adventurer! <cf>Get me five Douro Ores in a jiffy!
Douro Ore can be found in the Silent Forest. <cf>It's enough if you can get me five of them!
Be careful of the monsters. <cf>Then I'll be waiting for you!
Oh, you're back, adventurer! <cf> Looks like you found some douro ore.
Let's see. ...... Oh, it's a nice stone, isn't it? <cf>We've got a good number of them, so this should last us a while.
No, it's really a big help. Thanks a lot!
The people of the forest do not use the heritage of Buffalia. <cf>The weapons are made using traditional blacksmithing methods.
It's vital to get the <cf>engrams evenly aligned while working the wood and metal by hand.
This is where the skill and craftsmanship come into play. <cf>The weapons we make are highly accurate, man.
They're as good as the weapons you guys use.
Sorry about that!　I don't care about your bragging. <cf>I just remembered something else.
There are many legends among the forest folk. <cf>Among them, there is one that might be useful for you.
<cf>I can make it a little easier for you to find things when you're short of stones and materials like this time.
[<cf>It's a legend that says, "[Beseech the blue crystal flower]". <cf> I'd like to share this with you.
There is a blue crystal flower in the Forest of Silence. <cf>Will you accompany me there?
It should help you on your journey. <cf>As a thank you for the ore, let me tell you.
There is a legend among the people of the forest that you should pray to the blue crystal flower. <cf>It is useful when materials are in short supply.
It should also help adventurers on their journeys. <cf>Since I'm here, let me share it with you.
<cf>There is a blue crystal flower in the Forest of Silence. <cf> Will you accompany me there?
Oh!　This, this, this. <cf>This is the "Blue Crystal Flower" of the legend.
<cf>It's a saying that if you don't have the materials, you can make a wish here. <cf> Let's make a request right away!
First of all, find "Seishoka". <cf> Then, make a certain move in front of it.
Sprinkling the 'engrams' will <cf> lead to a wish for the forest!
Then the forest will bring you blessings. <cf>You'll see it at a glance when you do it.
I'm there for you when you run out of ore, too. <cf>You try it too when you're in trouble.
Sprinkle some engrams and wish for ["][blue crystal flower (seishoka)]"["]. <cf> Remember.
But it is only a help. <cf>But remember, it's only help, not endless help.
See you later!　<cf>I'll be happy to train your weapons too, when I get a chance!
How about a request to "Seishoka"? <cf>Has it helped?
If you follow the proper procedure, <cf>the forest should help you.
Sprinkle some engrams and make a wish to ["][Seishoka]"["]. <cf> Remember!
The ancestors of the forest people, when they die, <cf>return to the forest to watch over us!
The trees that grow in the forest are like our ancestors. <cf>We have to take care of them and respect them.
I thank my <cf> ancestors</cf> in the forest every day!
<cf> My ancestors! <cf>I am fine today, thank you!
An adventurer from outside the forest! <cf>So, please defeat the Soiree Tyrant Boa!
<cf>They're running amok in the Silent Forest! <cf>Bumping and scratching against the trees in the forest!
<cf> Even though our ancestors are sleeping in the forest! <cf>I can't forgive them for bothering us as much as they want!
Ha, ha... ...... <cf>I'm sorry. I'm so distraught. ......
You know, there is a monster called <cf>Soire Tyrant Boa</cf> in the Forest of Silence.
He goes on a rampage at night, damaging the trees in our precious forest.
Our ancestors are sleeping in the forest, but <cf>they can't get any rest!
<cf>To destroy the forest is the same as disrespecting our ancestors. <cf>I absolutely cannot allow it!
But the adults are too busy to <cf>take action</cf>. ......
So, adventurers, please get rid of them! <cf>Please!
Soiree Tyrant Boa are in the Forest of Silence. <cf>Be careful, they only come out at night.
I'm sure your ancestors will be on your side! <cf>Please, adventurer!
<cf>I'm sure they sleep peacefully during the day. <cf>You yourself disturb your ancestors' sleep!
I can't tolerate it anymore! <cf>Please, hurry up and take those guys down!
You defeated the Soiree Tyrant Boa!
Are you injured, adventurer? <cf> Thank goodness!　Thank you so much!
Now my ancestors can sleep peacefully. <cf>Maybe I'll have a good night's sleep, too!
The forest is really important to us.
When we, the people of the forest, complete our lives, we will return to the tree of life and become a part of the forest.
That's why we believe that our ancestors are in the forest, watching over our lives.
They also take care of the trees as if they were family grave markers. <cf>Because they are our precious ancestors!
My family is the same way!　I often go to visit them.
Adventurers are welcome to come and visit, too. <cf>I'm sure your ancestors will be happy to see you!
And if you ever have any trouble in the forest, let me know and I'll be happy to help. <cf>Thank you, kind adventurer!
I paid my respects to my ancestors just now.
<cf> When I told them about your adventurer, <cf>the leaves shook a little!
I'm sure the ancestors were <cf>thank you</cf> too!
[The township is guarded by a particularly skilled man.
Kapakuk is doing well. <cf>Young, but dependable.
However, we can't be <cf>reliant</cf> on him alone.
It's a shameful thing to ask someone outside of [the township]<cf>....... <cf>I need your help. I need you to listen to me.
<cf>Do you know the "Dark Peeping Mouth"?
This is a ferocious monster. <cf> He's a glutton.
When he gets hungry, he devours all the animals and plants in the forest <cf>at will. Not a single young bud is left.
<cf>It's walking around in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life" with a face like its own.
As a matter of fact, ...... I failed to kill him a long time ago.
It was before Pipimaruka was crowned queen. <cf>I was the keeper of Ullau.
That's when I came across the "Great Mouth that Peeps into the Dark. <cf> Just like now, he was ravaging the forest.
I went with my friends to take it down, but we missed it. <cf>And here we are.
I am old. I no longer have the strength to fight against the "Dark Peeping Mouth. <cf> It pains me to trouble the hand of the guardian of the time.
<cf>Kapa‧kaku has a lot of other work to do.
So I would like to humbly request you to do so. <cf>I hear you are a man of skill.
I'm sorry to impose this on you, an outsider, but I need you to take down <cf> "Ooguchi, the Dark Peeping Tiger</cf>.
<cf>It's my mismanagement that I failed to kill him. <cf> I won't stand for the forest being ruined because of it!
<cf> "Dark Peeping Oguchi" is in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life. <cf> Only, it appears only at night.
You can't say he's clever or cowardly. ...... <cf>I'm sure you can do it. I'm counting on you.
<cf>The "Dark Peeping Mouth" is located in the "Zero Zone of the Tree of Life. <cf> Be careful, they only come out at night.
If it weren't for this old body, <cf>I'd go there myself to clean up the mess. ......
Sorry to impose my mismanagement on you. <cf>I need to rely on your skills.
Did you do ...... by any chance? <cf>You took down the "Dark Peeping [Oguchi]", didn't you?
Oh, yeah!　Thank you. <cf> I'm sure everyone in the township will feel a little better now.
My years of regret have been cleared up. <cf>I really appreciate it. I owe you.
...... I let him get away with it <cf>when he was the previous queen.
It was a long time ago. <cf>The fall of my predecessor was sudden.
<cf>The throne could not be left vacant, so Pipimaruka was sworn in in a hurry.
She was still young and not fully prepared. <cf>It must have been hardest for everyone around him, but most of all for Pipimalka himself.
I wonder how hard it must have been for her to fulfill her duties<cf> as queen while enduring loneliness and sorrow. ......
I could not help the young queen. <cf>I missed the "Great Mouth" and added to her troubles.
If I had been as good as Kapakuku, <cf>I wouldn't have bothered Master Pipimaruka.
I hope this latest defeat will put your mind at ease. ......
Oops, I've talked too much. <cf>I'm sorry I put you through the pathetic talk of an old man.
Your power is real. <cf>Please help our queen. I beg you.
It's been a while since I've patrolled the woods. <cf> I can still do that much.
It's a small thing, but it will help <cf>[SATO] more than complaining.
Thanks to you, I have more energy. <cf>It's not a bad thing to be involved with people outside the <cf>[township].
It's not surprising, but <cf>the people of the forest know a lot about medicinal herbs.
The rich forests are a treasure trove of medicinal herbs. <cf>It's only natural that they live among them.
but they should not pick too many. <cf>Medicinal herbs are part of the forest, so we must take good care of them.
A bunch of dry plants have fallen. <cf>They look like they have been here for quite some time.
I wonder if they are medicinal herbs or something. <cf>The nose-piercing aroma is still there.
Maybe it's still useful. <cf>I'll ask someone who knows about medicinal herbs.
Hi, you must be the one called Adventurer. <cf>Do you have enough medicine?
I'm an impersonator of a doctor. <cf>I also prepare medicinal herbs for people in the township.
Oh?　This scent is from ....... <cf>Do you have any kind of medicinal herbs?
Oh, I found a bunch of plants in the forest, he said. <cf>Hm, it smells like a balm.
A balm, or a ....... <cf>Adventurer, could you do me a favor?
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>The woods have been noisy of late.
<cf>Monsters are getting feisty, and more and more of them are getting hurt.
<cf>That reminds me of a story that's been bothering me a bit.
It's a legend passed down among the people of the forest. <cf>A long time ago, in the time of our distant ancestors,<cf>......
<cf>A long time ago, in the time of our distant ancestors, <cf>a mysterious monster appeared in the forest, <cf>taking many victims.
It is said that this monster ["]harms souls["]. <cf>I don't know the details of what it means, but...
Its claws or its fangs? It was feared that if it hurt you, you would never be able to return to the forest again.
<cf>[It is the most dreadful thing for the people of the forest. <cf>That's much more than getting hurt.
When I was a little girl, <cf>I was told not to go into the woods alone.
Oh, I didn't get that monster. <cf>It's just ...... something I've been feeling a little uneasy about.
There have been a lot of incidents in the woods recently. <cf>The increase in injuries could be a sign of things to come.
I guess the lore is a lesson to be <cf>prepared<cf> if things go wrong.
I wonder if ["]soul damage["] means <cf> heartbreak.
That being said, I don't have <cf>enough</cf> herbs on hand to use as a remedy.
So I need you, the adventurer, to gather them for me. <cf>The people of the township don't seem to be able to get around to it.
<cf>Could you please do an additional survey of the "Hanameguri no Komura (flower garden)? <cf> I'm sure we can find the herbs we're looking for.
Thank you very much. <cf>There is no one in or out of the township to prepare for any eventuality.
You should be able to find the herbs of care in <cf>"Additional Research in Hanameguri".
You'll have to go deeper into the woods, so <cf>this will take a little more time. Sorry.
[The people in the township are not in a position to help us right now. <cf>Please do me a favor.
Hey there, adventurer. <cf>Did you find any herbs for your attention?
Thanks. Which one is this: ....... <cf>Yeah, that's all I need.
It must have been hard work. I appreciate it. <cf>The herbs will now be dried and preserved.
I don't know if it will work on wounded souls, but <cf> it should be one of the things we can be prepared for.
<cf>After death, the people of the forest become part of the forest through the <cf> tree of life. Have you ever heard of that?
That is the <cf> right way for us forest people to end.
But if our souls are harmed, it will not come true. <cf>That's what the lore means about not being able to return to the forest.
[The tree of life refuses to let them return to the forest, and they wander around with no place to go.
I shuddered just talking about it. ...... <cf>That's how horrible it must be for the forest people.
The day when the medicinal herbs you've gathered will come in handy<cf>I really hope it doesn't come.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was being rude. <cf>I am sincerely grateful to you.
I wish you didn't visit ...... if you do, <cf> but when you do, your deeds will help the people of the forest.
The people of the forest are indebted to you. <cf>I wish you the blessings of the forest. Thank you.
I'll keep the herbs for your attention. <cf>You never know when you may need them.
You adventurers, don't forget to be prepared. <cf>It's best not to be in the care of herbs.
Haha ....... <cf>When are you going to give up, Bros?
He's still talking <cf> like it's a dream, a treasure hunt in ancient times.
He won't even listen to me when I tell him that the desert is dangerous. <cf>Totally, he's a handful, my uncle.
Are you an adventurer, too, touring the ruins? <cf>There are a lot of ruins buried in the desert.
If you find any treasures, sell them to me. <cf>I won't give you a loss.
Come to think of it, I heard there's an eccentric guy somewhere who keeps excavating <cf> for treasures from long ago.
It would be interesting to see what he finds! <cf>If you see him, ask him about it.
Someone who is looking for treasure in the desert: ....... <cf>If you know of anyone, let's look for them!
Hey there, sometime adventurer. <cf> My uncle took care of you.
Do you remember him?　The eccentric guy who keeps digging <cf>holes in the desert looking for treasure.
Oh, it's you. <cf>The adventurer who delivered the medicinal herbs and stuff to Terua.
I've been looking for meldrite treasures since then, though. <cf>As usual, I haven't found a single one.
I don't have time to be selling oil here, <cf>I'd like to get back to digging.
What nonsense are you talking? <cf>The desert is dangerous right now.
Adventurer. I know you've got bros, but <cf>could you please take care of the monsters for a bit?
Thanks for taking me on. <cf>There's talk of seeing a "bloodthirsty" [dark night wolf] in the desert.
<cf>The roads are not passable because of him. <Even the peddlers are having a hard time, and everyone is annoyed.
<cf>But Bros. keeps trying to excavate. <cf>It was dangerous, so I dragged him back. ......
Han, a monster is nothing. <cf>I can't be scared off by that.
<cf>I heard that once upon a time, there were a lot of monsters in Meldreth.
But our ancestors and soldiers fought bravely to protect the city.
<cf>I have the blood of those ancestors running through my veins! <cf>I won't stop excavating just because of this!
You're talking about that again?　You can't fight Bros. <cf>Leave it to the adventurers and be quiet.
<cf>It's fine that you sent him back to town, but he's like this. <cf>He won't even listen to me.
<cf>I'm afraid he's really going to run off, that's why I asked the adventurers to help.
It seems that <cf>"Dark Night Wolf of the Sea of Bloodlust" is in <cf>"Twilight of the Sea of Sand: A Free Search.
Everyone in town is in trouble. <cf>Please, can you go and take them down?
The Dark Night Wolf of the Bloodthirsty is in a place called <cf>"Twilight in the Sea of Sand, a place for free exploration.
I'd appreciate it if you could take them out <cf>before the bros run off.
Everyone in town is in trouble, so please do me a favor. <cf>Take care and go.
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>You took down the [Dark Night Wolf] of [Bloodlust], didn't you?
Oh, thank you, adventurer! <cf> You can resume excavation right away!
That's all I have to say about that now. ...... <cf>You've just been defeated, so why don't you relax a little?
Hey, you guys. <cf>Have you heard about the "Dark Night Wolf" of [bloodlust]?
I heard that they disappeared and the <cf>monster</cf> that was near the road disappeared too.
Oh, this adventurer killed them. <cf>Maybe the merchants can rest easy now, too?
I didn't know that. Thank you. <cf> Thanks to you, we can resume our business.
<cf>It was worth praying to our ancestors.
Hmm?　That thing hanging in your bag is ....... <cf> Is that a medallion?　Looks like it's very old.
Ah, it's our traditional amulet. <cf>It's got an unusual pattern on it, doesn't it?
It's the <cf> coat of arms of the Meldrethite royal family.
What?　Meldrethite!
Oh, you know about it? <This thing is worth nothing to you.
My ancestors were Meldrethites, but <cf>they lost their town to desertification.
When they moved to Salamzat, <cf>the royal family did a lot for them.
The medallion was given to him at that time. <cf>I could have made some money if I sold it there.
<cf>But since the royal family was willing to give up their position and wealth<cf> to help us, they kept it for safekeeping.
Now it's part of a legend whose truth is unknown, and the <cf>medallion</cf> has faded away.
<cf>But the favor my ancestors received from me is still the same. <cf>We've passed this story down from generation to generation.
I see. ...... Oh, that's right. ......
Oops, my bad. I gave you a boring old story. <cf> Well, let's just say there are stories like that.
Anyway, thanks for the help. <cf>You're a benefactor to my family, too. <cf>Thanks for your help, too.
<cf>I think I've seen that coat of arms before. <cf>Is it possible that the meldrite story is true?
Terua!　I'm going to keep on excavating! <cf> Don't let me lose to my worthy ancestors!
I'm sure the day will come when you can <cf>feel</cf> the pride of Meldrethite, too!
Yeah, I'm sure. <cf>Good luck, Bros. Don't push yourself too hard.
Thanks again, adventurer. You've been a big help. <cf>And I got to hear some good stories.
<cf>I thought I would remember those fine people from long ago.
<cf>Bros. has been more and more <cf>excited since then.
He went out early again today, <cf>even though his relatives don't look good about it. ......
<cf>I'm just going to sit back and watch. <cf>I'm going to let them do it until they feel better.
<cf>It's been a long time since the village of Galeridge was destroyed.
I hear there were many skilled craftsmen in metalworking and craftsmanship.
<cf>But now they are all scattered and their skills have been lost. <cf>The monster's damage can be seen even here.
It is a pleasure to see you again. <cf>Thanks for the "Kartoum's Fang Work" thing.
<cf>Thanks for sniffing out another business opportunity, <cf>you are indeed the one I have been looking for!
This time I'm looking for the "Rainbow Clock of Galeridge". <cf>The dial changes color with the passage of time.
It was a luxury antique and much loved. <cf>I want to revive this "Gulley Ridge Rainbow Clock.
They don't make them anymore. <cf>It was made in the village of Gulley Ridge, as the name implies.
Maybe you've been there before? <cf>It's an abandoned village at the end of the "Galley Ridge Abandoned Road".
The villagers were scattered after a monster attack. <cf>It's now a stronghold of bandits.
The watchmaking process, the necessary skills and craftsmen<cf> seem to have been lost in the chaos.
However, I was able to <cf>find and talk to a craftsman who used to live in the village of Galley Ridge!
This is an important clue. <cf>There are two materials needed to make the rainbow clock.
Both of which can be found <cf>in "Tomdrum's Hidden Mine, Free Exploration".
<cf>One is the "Chromatic Crystal". <cf>This is a special crystal used in the heart of the clock.
The other is "Converite". <cf>A metal used to change the brilliance of quartz crystals.
<cf>The mineral can be extracted for the "chrome quartz". <cf>The problem is with the combalite.
<cf>The problem is that you can't get it unless you kill the Draugma.
So we need to collect it and kill it. <cf>I can only ask an adventurer as skilled as you.
<cf>I need "Chromatic Crystal" and "Combalite" please! <cf>First, let's get the materials together and go for the rainbow clock!
<cf>The materials for the Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge can be found in <cf>"Tomdrum's Hidden Mine, Free Search".
<cf>Four "Chromatic Crystals". <cf>You should be able to get this by collecting minerals.
And 6 pieces of "Combalite". <cf>This one requires defeating Draug Alma.
To recreate the rainbow clock, we'll start with the materials! <cf>You can do it. <cf>You can do it!
Good work. <cf>It looks like you've gathered up the "Chromatic Crystal" and "Combalite".
Oh, I've missed this one. <cf>It must be the material for the Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge.
You've collected some good stuff, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for all your hard work.
He was a craftsman who lived in the village of Gulley Ridge. <cf>I heard he once worked on a rainbow clock.
<cf>He did a few when he was young. <cf>It's a clock that holds a lot of memories for me.
<cf>When I heard that you were going to recreate the "Rainbow Clock of Gulley Ridge," <cf> I just had to come.
I don't know. Now that you have all the materials, <cf>could you please get to work on it?
I'll make a lot of rainbow clocks with it and <cf>make a lot of money!
Hmmm, what? <cf>Wouldn't you just reproduce one?
If you want to make a lot of them, <cf>you'll have to get all the artisans in the village to do it!
Not only do we need artisans, we also need miners. <cf>Some people to prepare the food.
<cf>That's the watch the whole village used to make. <cf>I can't do it alone.
Well, I'm sure I could <cf>give you one over the years.
I'm sure I could <cf>give you one of those clocks over the years!　There is no way <cf>one person could mass produce such an exquisite watch. ......
It's not a very viable business <cf> if it takes years to make one watch.
I'm sorry if I made you feel stupid. <cf>Sorry about that.
But hey, lady. And you, adventurer. <cf>I'm glad to be associated with the Rainbow Clock again.
I thought it would be forgotten along with the village, <cf>but now the day has come to make it once more!
I don't know much about business, but <cf>I'm grateful. Thank you very much.
......Yes. <cf>It seems like the biggest profit this time around is to <cf>re-create</cf> the "Rainbow Clock of Galley Ridge"!
We must make sure that the materials you have worked so hard to collect will not be <cf>wasted</cf> and will be preserved for future generations!
It's not quite what I had in mind, but <cf>I'm glad I asked you to do it.
I'll think about the business again. <cf>I'll ask you again then.
There are so many forgotten or <cf>lost masterpieces in the world.
It would be interesting to discover them and <cf>recreate them.
<cf>Wouldn't it be nice to revive them as one-of-a-kind pieces, without having to make so many of them, so that people would talk about them?
