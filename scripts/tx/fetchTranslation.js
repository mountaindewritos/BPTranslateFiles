// If the `ja_JP_unique_strings.txt` is too large, the DeepL API will reject it. 
// One option is to split it into separate server/client files and try again. 
// An easier but more manual alternative is to paste it into an `.xlsx` spreadsheet, manually upload it to DeepL to translate, and paste the translation back into a `.txt` file then continue the steps.

// Translate ja_JP_strings.txt into en_US_strings.txt

// DeepL API
// Use glossary
