It's a grassland that gently welcomes adventurers who have just left Asterlies. <lf>It<lf>'s a perfect place for novice adventurers to test their skills, and many adventurers come and go today as well.
Minster Ranges
A hilly area where pleasant breezes blow through. <lf>The Minsterhorn windmill, which uses the wind that is <lf>constantly blowing, is famous as a local specialty of the village.
Andorra basin
A basin surrounded by cliffs and mountains where part of the terrain has settled and rock faces protruding. <lf>The ruins of the <lf>ancient city of Andorra at the northern end are now uninhabited ruins and are called the “silent city.” <lf>The Bavarian Order is stationed at <lf>the ruins and guards so that heinous monsters don't run amok outside the ruins.
Yunagi Terrace
It is divided into two areas due to the uplift of the earth. <lf><lf>There are many <lf>adventurers who go to explore the ruins of the “Ancient City of Ville,” but they also have strong enemies, so in case of emergency, it's a good idea to take a break at “Stray Man's Rock Shade.”
At the foot of a quiet mountain
<lf><lf>It was a zone known as a trade route to “Ritz” since ancient times, but recently it has come to be regarded as a dangerous trade route, with “Bergmaar Village” being attacked by enemies. <lf>There is also a <lf>village of goblins, and skilled guards are also provided during the pilgrimage of the Oracle Shrine Maiden.
Fier Ridge Pond
<lf>It is a zone where water flows everywhere, starting with the area around the “Augustus Ruins,” which are now sinking into the flow of a waterfall. <lf><lf>There is also a camp for goblins, and the enemies are pretty strong, so it's known as a training ground for skilled adventurers.
The hill that God watches over
<lf>It is a zone with a cool climate, watched over by the towering sacred place “Kamikake no Onna” of the Bavarian Order. <lf><lf>Many of the rocks that rise <lf>around Onbashira face Onbashira and hang their necks, and are described in the Bavarian sutras as miracles showing the power of the Bavarian gods. <lf>
Rize Trade Route
<lf>It is a zone centered around “Ritz,” which has been loved by caravans aiming for the distant desert city “Salamzat,” as a resting place. <lf><lf>“Tower Rock” near Rize used to be known as a mine that produced high-quality ore.
Melissos river basin
<lf><lf>The “Great Rize Cave,” which stretches along the flow of the Melissos River, is famous, but it is also known as a scenic zone, such as the “Otakyu Falls,” which is so steep that even dragons are said to fall. <lf><lf>At the east end, there is also the “Arid Valley Checkpoint,” which leads to the desert, and gatekeepers are holding back to protect people's safety.
Galley Ridge Abandoned Road
This is a zone with many steep cliffs even in the Monte Nord Valley. <lf>There is a beautiful waterside <lf>called the “Yalong Water Field,” but only a handful of adventurers can get there. <lf><lf>Adventurers who are familiar with their skills may try aiming for the “Gully Ridge Village Ruins,” which is now a hideout for bandits.
Rainfall Old Highway
<lf><lf>It is a zone rich in variety even in the Evergreen Desert, such as the “Bug Fort at Dawn,” which was built by insects over many years and turned into a huge mound, and the “Khartoum Ruins,” where the view of the desert from the top is reputed to be spectacular. <lf>It's also a long distance from <lf>Salamzart, so be sure to properly prepare the mount before heading out.
Valley of Sunshine
<lf>The “Valley of the Sun,” which welcomes travelers from the Monte Nord Valley with a dry breeze, is a zone with a relatively stable climate in the Evergreen Desert. <lf>It seems that there are many travelers who <lf>first get used to the desert climate at the “Hunter's Camp” here and then head to Salamzat.
Orvido Plain
This zone is home to the desert city “Salamzat.” <lf>The balloons <lf>placed everywhere are signposts by Salamzart merchants who want to welcome guests on long trips as soon as possible. <lf>When aiming for <lf>Salamzat, look up at the sky and try chasing a balloon.
Windproof Wasteland
The wind that blows through the desert weakens for some reason here, in the “Wasteland of the Wind Stop.” <lf>The <lf>huge “Spiritual Rock Tower” that rises in this zone is a tomb that enshrines the ancestral spirits of the people of this region. <lf>The people of <lf>Salamzat, who cherish their ancestors, still don't forget to pray to the “Spiritual Rock Tower.”
The dust that never came back
<lf>There is a camp called “Caravan Signpost,” where almost no one sets foot in, but there is a camp called “Caravan Signpost.” <lf>If you <lf>inadvertently step into “The Dust That Never Goes Home,” look for this camp first. <lf>If you're lucky, you might be helped by a skilled adventurer.
Lauleben Battlefield
<lf>An ancient battlefield where the Knights, which the Principality of Barnhardt is proud of, fought many times with dragons. <lf><lf>Remains of collapsed citadels, facilities, and destroyed batteries remain, and vestiges of fierce battles in the past have been conveyed to the present.
Lonely Castle
This is the area corresponding to Barnhart Castle's back gate square and surrounding area. <lf><lf>In wars with dragons, it is said that knights and soldiers gathered here and raised their momentum to protect their homeland and people.
Stahl coast
It is an area corresponding to the western end of the Duchy of Barnhart. <lf><lf>There was a stronghold for the dragon family on the other side of the ocean, and it continued to be at the forefront of repeated wars. <lf>Even now, there are a number of traces left from that time.
Shiomaihama
<lf>It is the region where development is progressing the most in “Cape Rahwehara,” centered around the settlement Jubilia. <lf><lf>It is still under development, but crops have been planted on the open land, and it is also being prepared as a ground for lining buildings.
The Hidden Valley of the Moon
It is the most remote area in “Cape Rahwehara.” <lf>It is also a place where extensive <lf>untouched nature has been preserved and has been an object of worship for people since ancient times. From here on, <lf>it continues to the hinterland of the outer continent, and deep forests spread out.
Oia Mole Reef
It is a beautiful coastal area where the sun shines and the sound of the waves is constant. <lf>On the seaside, <lf>which symbolizes “Cape Rahwehara,” countless rocks with accumulated coral are lined up, creating a unique landscape. You can also find many caves with <lf>open mouths behind rocks.
Break through the limit
<lf>You can “break through the limit” with equipment of the same type and materials dedicated to breaking the limit. <lf><lf>Each status of equipment that <lf>has broken through the limit will increase, and you can select and inherit the special effects and abilities of the equipment used as materials.
An abbreviation for Imagine
Each type of Imagine is called by the following abbreviations. <lf>E-Imagine: Enhanced Imagines. Level up the adventurer's abilities. <lf>B-Imagine: Battle Imagine. Support adventurers' battles. <lf>M-Imagine: Mount Imagine. It supports the movement of adventurers.
Mount Caravan
<lf>If you dispatch your M-Imagine to “Mount Caravan,” you can receive various items as a thank you. <lf><lf>Mount Caravans can be used from the Bureau of Reclamation.
The ebb and flow of the tide
At Cape Rahwehara, the sea level rises and falls over time. <lf>There are places you can only go when <lf>the tide is low or when it's full, so be careful about the height of the sea level when walking along the sea.

Basic knowledge about adventures<lf>, such as class characteristics, is also included.
Adventurer Rank 2 Promotion Test
<lf>In this test, it is important not only to prepare equipment, but also to have the wisdom to defeat enemies using the gimmicks that are there. <lf><lf>Don't just focus on enemies; take a close look at your surroundings. <lf>
Adventurer Rank 3 Promotion Test
In this test, a large amount of “falling rocks” will fall from the ceiling. If <lf>you hit a falling rock, you'll faint and fall into a pinch all at once. <lf>In addition to preparing equipment that is <lf>resistant to fainting, it is also effective to avoid falling rocks themselves. Let's try to avoid it. <lf>
Adventurer Rank 6 Promotion Test
<lf>In this exam, “Numbness Swamp,” which paralyzes when you step in, will appear. <lf>If you have equipment that is <lf>resistant to paralysis, you can endure it, so be sure to prepare your equipment and take on the challenge. <lf>
Adventurer Rank 8 Promotion Test
This is a dangerous test where HP is being cut due to the “Poison Pool.” <lf>It is necessary to have the courage to attack all at once, <lf>even if you receive poison in case of emergency, while being careful about character movements due to skill and evasion use. Let's <lf>fight while judging the situation.
When you can't clear a mission
<lf>If you can't clear a mission, raise your level or clear additional investigation missions to collect equipment. <lf>It is also recommended that you further enhance your <lf>equipment with “Break Through the Limit,” where you collect the same equipment and make it stronger.
d
Bomb Dal
When attacked, “Demolition Dahl” explodes and deals damage to surroundings. <lf>Guide nearby enemies and collectively inflict damage.
Flash pot
<lf>The “Flash Pot,” which emits light when attacked, stuns enemies for a fixed period of time. <lf>Let's make it emit light at just the right moment.
Yagura
“Yagura” can be destroyed by attacking it. <lf>Let's destroy the yagura and make the enemies above fall.
breakable wooden boxes, etc.
<lf>There are cases where things that break when attacked, such as wooden boxes, are placed inside the dungeon. <lf><lf>If you destroy those things, Runo can be obtained on rare occasions, and HP will be restored.
Thorn Trap
If you touch the “Thorn Trap,” you will take a lot of damage. Let's advance in the <lf>dungeon while being careful about our surroundings.
Forbidden Trap
<lf>There are several types of “no-go traps,” such as those where the fence is always out and you cannot pass through, and those where the fence goes up and down at regular intervals. <lf>You can't get through <lf>while the fence is up, so be sure to check the timing and get through.
spray trap
<lf>When the “spray trap” comes into contact with the fog that erupts, there are times when dangerous conditions such as paralysis occur abnormally. It is possible to identify abnormal conditions by <lf>the color of the spray. <lf>First, avoid spraying so that the condition does not become abnormal.
Bulkhead and release switch
If the “next door” is closed, it is impossible to pass through. <lf>The “release switch” is somewhere, so let's look for it.
Poison pool
<lf>If you pass over the “Poison Pool,” the poison state will become abnormal and your HP will gradually decrease. Watch your step in the dungeon.
suppliers
It is an enhancement device installed inside a dungeon. <lf><lf>If you use <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/><span color="Action">] </>, your abilities will temporarily increase, so if you see one, try using it. <lf>There are various effects such as <lf>“Attack Power Up,” “Speed Up,” and “HP Recovery.”
release switch
Look for hints and open the bulkheads by pressing the switches in sequence. <lf>Hints can be found by touching the light in various rooms. <lf>Hints found can also be checked in the system log. If you <lf>press the switch in the order of the correct answers, the bulkhead will open. <lf>Also, when you fail, enemies will appear, so be careful.
Enemy Slayer
It's an object that strengthens all enemies. <lf>You can destroy it by attacking it. <lf><lf>If you leave it, your enemies will continue to be strengthened, so let's actively destroy them.
Simple Transfer Portal
It is a device through which players move. <lf><lf>By touching the portal, you instantly move to another simple transfer portal.
defensive battle
<lf>This content protects the “Engram Wall,” which surrounds defense targets from a large number of enemies. <lf>If the <lf>Engram Wall isn't destroyed until the time limit and can be fully defended, you win.
Adventurer Rank 10 Promotion Test
This is an exam where the “Unlock Box” will appear. <lf>You can move forward by <lf>carrying the unlocking box to the pedestal, but your stamina gradually decreases during transportation. <lf>If you <lf>stop there, your stamina will recover, so be careful about your stamina as you proceed.
unlocking box
“Unlock Box” is a gimmick where you carry a key and open a door. <lf>By <lf>carrying the key object and setting it on a pedestal, the door opens and you can move forward. <lf><lf>If you can't find your key, try searching for places you haven't been to yet.
Enemy gate
It is a device that summons enemies one after another. <lf><lf>As long as it's moving, enemies will be summoned every certain amount of time, so if you see one, prioritize destruction.
Adventurer Rank 12 Promotion Test
<lf>This time, there will be a gimmick that brings about a “restraint” state that immobilizes adventurers. <lf><lf>The state of restraint can be prevented with “anti-bind,” so let's equip E-Imagine with anti-bind.
attack checker
<lf>“Attack Checker” is a facility that can measure how much damage can be done. <lf>You can measure damage with a combination of <lf>your current equipment and tactical skills, and practice before challenging the content. <lf>It can also be used at parties.
Yubu Ashinuma
If you pass over “Blunt Ashiguma,” your movement speed will decrease. <lf><lf>It will be difficult to <lf>evade attacks from enemies, so be sure to equip yourself with a resistant E-Imagine or try not to enter as much as possible.
vents
You can fly high by riding on the “vents” that are gushing out. <lf><lf>Use it to move to higher places, or use it to evade attacks from enemies.
laser fence
<lf>If you touch the “laser fence,” you will suffer damage or condition abnormalities. <lf><lf>Depending on the height, it is possible to avoid it by jumping or going underneath.
Beam cannon
Beams are fired every fixed amount of time. <lf>If <lf>you hit a beam, you'll take a lot of damage, so if you see any signs, avoid them and make sure you don't hit them.
lamp door

Gathering spots
Plants, trees, rocks, etc. shine brightly in places where collection is possible. <lf><lf><lf>Items that can be collected are classified into 3 categories: “plants,” “minerals,” and “aquatic habitats,” and what types of items can be collected are displayed as icons on the collection spots in advance. <lf>You can collect again after a certain period of time has passed after collection.
Let's walk around the field
<lf>The map is initially covered with clouds, but the clouds clear up in places I've visited. <lf><lf><lf>Also, a creature called “Happy Nappo” is sometimes hidden in the field. If you find one, try talking to them.
How to use pins

Recovering from state changes
Most changes in condition will heal on their own after a certain period of time. Be careful of <lf><lf>state changes where HP gradually decreases. If you run out of <lf>HP before it heals naturally, you won't be able to fight.
ENHANCE IMAGINE
<lf>Enhanced Imagines are imagines that improve adventurers' basic abilities. <lf><lf>There are 5 symbols, and each symbol can be equipped with 1 Enhanced Imagine.

Falling from a high place

Engram Cannon
<lf>The Engram Cannon is a special device that can be used in raid missions. <lf>It <lf>is extremely effective against enemies, so don't miss the timing when you can use it and actively use it
Missions - Time Limits
Missions have time limits. If the <lf>time limit is reached, the capture will fail and the mission will end. Keep an eye on the <lf><lf>time limit as you proceed.
Missions - Battle Areas
When a battle area occurs, a rock wall will appear. <lf>Rock Wall is unlocked by defeating the target enemy.
Lianmian Pagoda
<lf>Once the conditions set for each floor are met, the transfer device can be used, and you can proceed to the next floor. <lf>You'll get rewards every time you advance <lf><lf>a certain number of floors, so try again and again and do your best to gradually advance to the next floor.
Explore freely
<lf>Some dungeons can be explored without a time limit by walking back into some dungeons after the main quest. There are materials and <lf><lf>special enemies that can only be obtained here. There are <lf>other players, so let's work together to explore them.
class quests
<lf>This is a quest where you can learn the basics of the class with your class partner in each class. <lf>They will give <lf>you play tips for each class, so be sure to take them actively.
engram

Battle score
Some missions have battle score limits. <lf><lf>If <lf>you're running out of battle scores, try crafting new weapons and imagines, and raise your class level to raise your battle score.
Named enemy
It's a special enemy that appears when certain conditions are met. <lf><lf>It<lf>'s much stronger than normal enemies, but if you defeat them, there's a certain chance you'll get Battle Imagination ideas.
Impossibility of combat and rescue
<lf>If you revive on your own after being unable to fight on the field or free exploration map, you will restart from a nearby revival point. <lf>If you get <lf>rescued by other players, you can revive where you fell, and return to your adventure right away.
d
matching
<lf><lf>If you select “Request Matching” when starting a mission, you can challenge missions with other players without forming a party. <lf>Feel free to try matching.
treasure chest
<lf>The treasure chests that appear are assigned individually to each player without competing with other players. <lf>If you find a treasure chest, don't hesitate to open it.
fluxes
<lf>It's an enemy that became ferocious due to the influence of “Distortion” in Abalitia. It has <lf>the characteristic of wearing a strange engram haze. The abbreviation <lf><lf>“F” is used for flux.
Machina, Proto-Machina
<lf>It is an entity created by mechanizing and modifying various enemies using technology from the Bavarian civilization. The <lf>prototype is called Proto-Machina. <lf><lf>Machina uses the abbreviation “M,” and Proto-Machina uses the abbreviation “PM.”
Recovery of physical strength on the field
<lf>On the field, if you deliver your sword without being spotted by an enemy, your HP will gradually recover. <lf>The amount of recovery increases <lf>during the “sit” gesture, so when your HP runs out, sit back and recover your HP.
Class Level Bonuses
<lf>The class level becomes a fixed value, and as the expert rank increases, a class level bonus corresponding to the expert rank is added. <lf><lf><lf>Class level bonuses for all classes will be added to the current class parameters, so try leveling up other classes as well.

Get back to the city with Space Transfer
Spatial transfer is a convenient function that can reduce travel time. <lf>You can instantly move from the </> map in the <lf>command menu <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">] to the city's transfer portal. <lf>First, let's open the map screen in the command menu.
Get an advantage in battle with Battle Imagine
<lf>Immediately, let's equip the “Battle Imagine” you just got with the <lf>command menu <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">] </> “Characters” > “Battle Build.” <lf>Battle Imagines have various skills such as attack and healing. Let's look for <lf>battle imagines that suit your battle style. <lf><lf>Once you've equipped your Battle Imagine, let's talk to “Murry” from the Bureau of Development <lf>again. I'll teach you <lf>how to become an adventurer.
Get ready for an adventure
This time, I'm going on an expedition to the edge of “The Prairie of the Sound of the Sea.” Let's <lf>rely on route guides and quest icons to advance. It's also a good idea to try collecting at <lf>a collection spot along the way. <lf><lf>There are also aggressive enemies on the field. <lf>Take the healing medicine out of the warehouse and put it in your bag <lf>so you don't get hurt and fall down along the way. <lf>The girl at the asset management desk at the end of the Development Bureau will guide you to the warehouse.
Let's make a weapon
<lf>If you have the recipe you just got, you can craft weapons and items by consuming materials and runo in a <lf>rolling ball training tool. <lf>First, let's listen to the story of Huovi, who is close to the ball rolling exercise.
Did you use any new skills?
<lf>On the command menu <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/><span color="Action">] </>, you can check the skills you have learned. <lf><lf>Once you've learned multiple skills, change them in “Battle Build,” customize them to your own liking, and battle.
Obtained a weapon recipe
<lf>You may get weapons and imagination recipes, such as when you clear missions. <lf><lf>If you have recipes, you'll be able to craft weapons, battle imagines, and enhanced imagines. <lf>First, let's go back to town and listen to Murry's story.
Use your wishlist
<lf>“Wish List” is a function that allows you to notify when materials necessary for crafting are available and display recipes on the main screen. <lf>You can add recipes to your wish list from <lf>the crafting screen, etc., so register more and more recipes you're interested in. <lf><lf>Also, if you want to check the collection status at any time, you can display it on the HUD. <lf>Go to <lf>“Quests” > “Wish List” in the command menu to display the list, and check the checklist of recipes you want to display in the <lf>HUD. <lf>The HUD can display up to 3 lists at once.
I got a weapon board
<lf>I got recipes and adventure boards from the “Dragon Nail” series of weapons as rewards from quests. <lf>On weapon <lf>adventure boards, challenge rewards are weapon materials, so you can efficiently collect materials by completing tasks. <lf>First, let's complete the tasks on the “Dragon Nails” board.
<lf><lf><lf>Materials in the “Dragon Nails” series <lf>· Giant Fangs Fossils: Rewards for clearing “Dragon Scars: Additional Investigation” · Goblin's Fangs: Obtained by defeating goblins in “Dragon's Claw Scars: Free Search” · Annular Stones: Obtained from mineral collection points Only giant tusk fossils cannot be obtained from adventure boards. <lf>Let's go through “Dragon Scars: Additional Investigations” and gather materials.
Enemy's Combined Skills
Enemies sometimes cooperate in groups and use special techniques. <lf>If you see suspicious movements, be sure to prioritize and defeat them.
Target - Attack
<span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="MainAction"/><span color="Action">] You can attack by pressing </>. <lf><span color="Action"><span color="Action"><lf>(Continuous attacks are possible by pressing and holding) You can fix an attack target by pressing [</>] </> while an enemy is <lf>nearby. <key color="Action" action="Lockon"/> <lf><lf>Use evasion <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="Dodge"/><span color="Action">] </> and fight while dodging attacks. <lf><span color="Action"><span color="Action">Evasion <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="Dodge"/><span color="Action">] </> and jumping during battle [</>] </> <key color="Action" action="Jump"/> It <lf>consumes stamina. <lf>If you run out of <lf>stamina, you won't be able to take actions that consume your stamina, so be careful.
jumps
<lf>You can make the character jump with <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="Jump"/><span color="Action">] </>. Jumping <lf>only consumes stamina during battle.
route guide
A route guide will show you the way to your “next destination.” <lf><lf>While the main quest is in progress, the main quest route guide will be displayed on a priority basis. <lf><span color="Action"><span color="Action"><span color="Action">Press [</> <key color="Action" action="dash"/><span color="Action">] </> while pressing [</>] </> to dash <key color="Action" action="Move"/> So please use it when <lf>following a route guide.
<lf>If you want to display route guides for other quests, select the quest for which you want to display route guides from “Quests” <lf>> “Order Quests” in the command menu.
dashes
<span color="Action"><span color="Action">If you press <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="dash"/><span color="Action">] </> while pressing [</>] </>, it will dash. <key color="Action" action="Move"/> <lf>Stamina is not used when not in combat, so please make use of it.
skills
<span color="Action">You can activate tactical skills by <span color="Action">pressing [</>] </> <key color="Action" action="Skill1"/> during battle. <lf>The <lf>tactical skills that can be activated vary from class to class, and most skills have an “interval.” <lf>You won't be able to use <lf>that skill during the interval, so be careful when using tactical skills.
Harvest
<span color="Action"><span color="Action"><lf>Material items can be obtained by interacting with the field's collection spots [</>] </>. <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/> <lf>There are <lf>various collection spots on the ground, rocky areas, etc., and the items that can be obtained from each are also different. <lf><lf><lf><lf>Once collected, a collection spot can be collected again after a certain period of time has passed, so if you want to collect a lot, wait a while and then visit the spot again.
<lf><lf>Once collected, a collection spot cannot be collected for a while, but if a certain period of time has passed, or if you return to the city and visit again, it may be possible to collect it. <lf>If you've run out <lf>of collecting spots on the field, try going back to town.
Aegis Fighter Features
<lf>While pressing <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">] </> during battle, Aegis Fighter performs a “shield guard” by holding up a shield. <lf><lf>If you <lf>receive an enemy attack while shieldguard, your HP does not decrease, but instead your “shield gauge” decreases, and when the gauge becomes 0, shield-related actions become unusable for a while.
<span color="Action"><lf>If you enter <span color="Action">[</>] <key color="Action" action="MainAction"/> </> immediately after defending an attack, you can activate a powerful Counter-Slash.
Twin Striker Features
<lf>Twin Striker's “combo gauge” increases every time an attack is hit. <lf><lf>The <lf>higher this gauge, the greater the damage dealt, but if your HP drops more than a certain amount after being attacked, the gauge will be reset, so let's fight by making full use of evasion and HP absorption buffs.
Features of Blast Archer
<lf>In Blast Archer, you can increase the <lf>“buff charge gauge (BC gauge)” by hitting an attack, and use the class action “Cure Arrow.” <lf><lf><lf><span color="Action"><span color="Action"><lf>The BC gauge increases more when weak point attacks or critical attacks that hit specific areas occur, so let's attack aggressively while properly using the presence or absence of lock-on [</>] </> depending on the situation. <key color="Action" action="Lockon"/>
Spell Caster Features
Spell casters consume EP and use powerful skills. <lf>You'll be able to fire up <lf>a series of powerful skills until you run out of EPs, so if you're feeling overwhelmed, attack all at once. <lf><lf>EPs recover after using <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">] </> or some class skills, or after a certain period of time in a non-combat state.
Smasher Features
<lf>Heavy Smasher can consume bullets and attack with various skills when there are remaining bullets in the cartridge. <lf>Consumption varies by skill. <lf><span color="Action">You can also reload with <lf><span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">] </> after using all bullets, but with remaining bullets [</> <key color="Action" action="SubAction"/><span color="Action">] </> You can also reload by pressing and holding. <lf>If you reload <lf><lf>while using all bullets, it will be a quick reload, and in addition to being able to reload quickly, the number of bullets will increase by 2. <lf>Manage the number of bullets and make effective use of quick reload.
Transfer portal
<lf>By using “transfer portals” in various parts of the city and fields, it is possible to move instantaneously between transfer portals by spatial transfer. <span color="Action"><span color="Action"><lf>You <lf>need to register a portal to use it, so if you find a <lf>new portal, register the portal with [</>] </>. <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/>
Transfer portal registration
<lf>Delivery recipients are waiting close to the forwarding portal, so if there's a portal you haven't registered yet, let's register. <lf>Portals can also <lf>be used to move around the city, and you can also return directly to each portal from outside the city, making your adventure even easier.
Asset Management Office
The asset management counter will keep the adventurer's assets. <lf><lf><lf>Warehouses can store items, weapons, costumes, etc., and you can also sell things that are no longer in use. <lf>Items not used during the <lf>adventure, such as material items, are automatically sent to the warehouse when obtained. <lf><lf><lf>Also, you can change the character's equipment in “Battle Build.” It's a good idea to stop by <lf>to organize your bags before you go on an adventure.
rush battle
<lf>In “Rush Battles,” which take place in arenas, you can get rewards such as ability plugs that can be used to enhance weapons by winning. <lf><lf>There are multiple difficulty levels available, and the higher the difficulty level, the better the rewards.
<lf>If there's a difficulty level you can't clear, complete other missions from “Missions” in the <lf>command menu and craft new weapons. <lf>Equipping powerful weapons makes it easier to capture.
time attack
This is content where you compete with other players for time until you clear. <lf>Also, you can earn special rewards every time you pass the specified time. <lf>Gear up your weapons and enhanced imagination and try again and again. <lf><lf>Time Attack rankings can be checked on the “ranking boards” arranged <lf>around the city.
Imagine Institute
<lf>At the Imagine Laboratory, you can craft Enhanced Imagines (E-Imagines) etc. by consuming materials and Runo. <lf>In addition to <lf>equipping E-Imagine to raise parameters, it also strengthens adventurers with abilities that have been granted. <lf><lf>E-Imagine comes in the form of 5 different symbols. The <lf>E-Imagine that I'm going to make is the symbol of “Mitsuba.” <lf><lf>You <lf>can equip one E-Imagine for each symbol, so if you get a new E-Imagine recipe, pay attention to that imagination's shape (symbol) as well.
Named Enemies
When certain conditions are met on the field, a <lf>“challenge quest” will occur, and a named enemy will appear. <lf>There are various appearance conditions, <lf>such as continuing to hunt specific enemies or appearing only at night. Be sure to look for it. <lf><lf><lf>Also, if you defeat Named Enemies, you may be able to obtain “Ideas.” <lf><lf>Gather “Ideas” and other materials, craft “Battle Imagines,” and summon powerful enemies from the past to advance the battle advantageously.
Battle Imagines Crafting
<lf>In order to craft “Battle Imagines,” you need materials determined for each imagination. <lf><lf>First, you'll need that Imagine's “Idea,” but you may also need other materials that can be obtained by gathering or defeating them.
Imagine's Abilities
<lf>When crafting Imagines, abilities may be granted. <lf>The effect values of abilities <lf>that may be granted and their probability are fixed for each Imagine ability.
battle rock wall
<lf><lf>Battle Rock Walls, which stop players in dungeons, can be unlocked and advanced by fulfilling conditions such as defeating specific enemies. If you <lf>can't get ahead, try defeating the enemies around you.
attributions
Some player attacks have attributes attached to them. <lf><lf><lf>There are 6 types of attributes: fire, ice, thunder, earth, light, and darkness, and by repeatedly attacking with attributes, it is possible to cause an enemy to have an abnormal attribute state.
<lf>Each time an attribute attack is applied to an enemy, attribute values accumulate, and when a certain amount is exceeded, the attribute state of the most common attribute will be abnormal. <lf><lf><lf>(Even if you hit an attack with a different attribute, the attribute values will accumulate) The effect of the abnormal attribute state increases as you advance through the 3 levels of Lv1, Lv2, and burst.
<span color="Emphasis"><lf>If the fire attribute state is abnormal </> Lv1, 2, you will be engulfed in flames, and your HP will gradually decrease. <lf><lf>When it becomes a fire burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the burst finish, causing a lot of damage.
<lf>If the attribute <span color="Emphasis">state of the ice attribute is abnormal </> Lv1, 2, the target is covered with ice, and the movement speed decreases. <lf><lf>When it becomes an ice burst, when the burst occurs, it is covered by an ice block and you cannot move, and the ice block explodes at the burst finish, causing a lot of damage.
<lf>When the attribute <span color="Emphasis">state of the lightning attribute is abnormal </> Lv1, 2, an electric current runs through the body, and there is a certain probability that action will be hindered. <lf><lf><lf>When it becomes a lightning burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the burst finish, causing significant damage and paralysis at the same time.
<lf>When the attribute <span color="Emphasis">state of the soil attribute is abnormal </> Lv1, 2, the earthen mass clings to the body, and damage taken increases. <lf>When it becomes a <lf>dirt burst, when the burst occurs, it is covered by a clod of earth and becomes immovable, and when the burst finishes, the earthen block explodes, causing a lot of damage.
<lf>When the attribute <span color="Emphasis">state of the light attribute is abnormal </> Lv1, 2, it is covered by light and damage dealt is reduced. <lf><lf><lf>When it becomes a light burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the burst finish, causing massive damage and continuous HP recovery to nearby players.
<lf><lf>When the attribute <span color="Emphasis">state of the Darkness attribute is abnormal </> Lv1, 2, the darkness clings together, and there is a certain probability that the attack will be mistaken. <lf><lf><lf>When it becomes a dark burst, a small explosion occurs when the burst occurs, and a large explosion occurs at the burst finish, causing a large damage and an HP leak at the same time.
Attack omens
There are omens to some enemy attacks. <lf><lf>Once an area where an attack is predicted appears, the attack will come there, so let's basically concentrate on evasion.
Gestures to other players
<lf>By making gestures from the communication menu, you can make gestures aimed at other players.
climb
Some walls can be climbed up with a climb. <lf><span color="Action"><span color="Action">If you <lf>get close to a wall you can climb on and enter [</>] </>, you will get caught by the wall. <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/> <lf>Furthermore, if you <span color="Action">enter [</> <key color="Action" action="MoveFront"/><span color="Action">] </>, it will climb. Areas where you <lf><lf>can climb are shown as icons on the minimap. <lf>If you can't find your way forward, try searching for it.
Issued items
<lf>You cannot use the items in your bag during missions, and you can only use items provided by the Development Bureau. <lf>In addition to being able to <lf>use paid items in the item palette, they can also be registered as shortcut rings. <lf>Remaining distribution items will be collected at the end of the dungeon. <lf><lf>*There are also some missions where you can use bag items.
Engram Cannon
<lf>The Engram Cannon is a Bavarian legacy of aggregating surrounding engrams and firing at enemies. It has <lf>a tremendous effect on enemies. When the <lf>light is pale, you can board and use it. <lf>When it is glowing red, it cannot be used because it is being charged. <lf><lf><span color="Action"><lf><span color="Action">■ Operation method Getting <lf>on and off: [</>] </> Adjusting the firing direction: <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/> <key color="Action" action="CameraControl"/><span color="Action"><span color="Action"><lf>] </> Fire<lf>: <span color="Action">[</>] </> If attacked while boarding, you will receive <key color="Action" action="MainAction"/> damage So be careful.
Sub quests
You can also order quests from quest receptionists and people in the city. <lf><lf><lf>If you want to display a route guide other than the main quest, check the “Show on HUD” box and <lf>“Show route guide” radio button for the quest you want to display the guide in “Quests” > “Order Quests” in the command menu.
Quest-only items
<lf>Quest-only items are special items that can only be obtained while receiving specific quest orders. It doesn't fit <lf>in a bag or warehouse, and it can't be sold. You can only check the number you have <lf>in the quest journal or HUD display. <lf><lf>Please note <lf>that when you discard the quest, quest-only items will also be discarded, and even if you reorder the quest, they will be collected again from the beginning.
About classes
<lf><lf>In “Character” > “Battle Build” in the command menu, you can change classes by switching the weapon you are equipped to another type. <lf>Class changes are possible in towns, fields, and free exploration maps. <lf><lf><lf>(Class changes are not possible when viewed as hostile) Also, it is now possible to accept orders for “Class Quests.” <lf><lf><lf><lf>You can learn about class partners and classes selected for each class, so whether you're going on an adventure in your current class or changing classes, it's a good idea to take a class quest at the Development Bureau first.
d
More content
That's all for the main quests this time. <lf><lf>After that, search for various contents that exist all over the country, play, and enjoy.
<lf>Also, if you don't know what to do, try talking to the Receptionist at the Development Bureau. <lf><lf>Subquests at recommended levels will lead you to new content.
How to make gestures
<lf><lf>You can perform a gesture by selecting the gesture you want from the talk mode <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="ChatMode"/><span color="Action">] </>, or by calling up the gesture registered in the shortcut. <lf>Use gestures to communicate with other adventurers.
ENHANCED IMAGINE EQUIPMENT
<lf><lf>In addition to increasing ability values by equipping Enhanced Imagine, resistance to debuffs is increased due to special effects called abilities, and damage from attribute attacks is reduced. Use <lf>“Character” > “Battle Build” on the command menu to equip <lf>“Enhanced Imagine.”
<lf>The level of the Enhanced Imagines we crafted this time is high, so there is a possibility that “Level Sync” will be applied when equipped. <lf><lf><lf>“Level Sync” means that when the level of the equipment is higher than the player's class level, the equipment parameters are temporarily limited. <lf><lf><lf><lf><lf><lf>(If it's E-Uriuri Uribo, it will show its true value from class level 5) If the player's class level is equal to the equipment level, it will be possible to fully demonstrate the power of the equipment, so even if you get strong equipment, when you don't know how strong you have become, it's a good idea to raise your class level.
<lf>Enhanced Imagines come in the form of 5 different symbols, and you can equip only 1 Imagine for each symbol. <lf>Once <lf>you've got a new recipe, keep an eye out for that Enhanced Imagine shape.
Adventurer rank up board
Congratulations, you've been registered with the Bureau of Reclamation as an adventurer. <lf>However, as an adventurer, I'm still a chick. <lf><lf>First, let's advance the challenges described in the “Adventure Board” and raise your adventurer rank. <lf><lf><lf>Square assignments within the board that are not connected by a line from the start are tasks that can be advanced at any time while the board is in progress. <lf>There is also a completion reward that you can get if you <lf>complete all of the tasks, so let's actively proceed with the challenges.
<lf>Also, you can receive “side quests” from people in the city and Receptionist at the Development Bureau. <lf><lf>The adventure board and sub-quests can also proceed in parallel, so it's a good idea to take on sub-quests from the Development Bureau. <lf><lf>The <lf><lf>HUD order quest list can be displayed by switching between order acceptance quests, wish lists, and adventure boards by <span color="Action">pressing [</> <key color="Action" action="QuestHudChange"/><span color="Action">] </>. Let's display the tasks you want to work on <lf>now.
Raise your adventurer rank
<lf>To get Jake to introduce you to your new job, let's first proceed with the adventure board assignments you've been given. <lf>For the final assignment, you will take an exam (battle) from Murry. <lf><lf>Prepare your weapons and enhanced imagination, face the test, and improve your adventurer rank!
Weapon Crafting - Additional Elements
In crafting, “special effects” may be given to weapons. <lf><lf>For example, if the special effects of the “Goblin type” are added, the damage dealt to Goblin enemies will increase.
Also, a “socket” is attached to the weapon you craft. <lf>You <lf>can add up to 4 sockets, and you can add items called ability plugs for as many sockets as there are. <lf><lf><lf>With the ability plug, you can add abilities such as “increase attack power” to weapons.
The weapon I crafted this time has the “attribute” of fire. <lf>Even with attacks that don't have <lf>attributes such as normal attacks, etc., it is possible to inflict greater damage than usual on enemies that use fire attributes as weak points. <lf>The damage display changes when <lf><lf>attacking weak point attributes, so be careful about the enemy's weak point attributes as well.
Show search range
<lf>In some quests, such as defeating designated enemies or searching for objects, a circular search area may be displayed on the minimap. <lf>First, let's aim for that exploration area. <lf>Also, multiple search ranges may be displayed at once.
Tutorial help
<lf>Some tutorial help can be reread as many times as you like with the “Travel Guide <lf><span color="Action"><span color="Action">” in “Adventure Notebook” in the command menu [</><key color="Action" action="CommandMenu"/>] </>. <lf><lf>Also, basic adventurer knowledge is included in the guide, so take a look if you have any problems or want to know.
Minimap and layer map
A round mini-map is displayed on the main screen. <lf>The <lf>arrow in the center is the character, and the direction of the arrow indicates the direction it is currently facing. <lf><lf>In addition, the locations of quests, shops, portals, etc. are also displayed as icons. <lf><lf>Also, if you press <span color="Action">[</> <key color="Action" action="wholeMap"/><span color="Action">] </>, the layer map will be displayed. <lf><lf><lf>(Press again to hide the layer map) You can also check the character's position etc. on the layer map, but you can see a larger area at once. Please use it <lf>properly depending on the situation.
Unable to fight
<lf>If a character is unable to fight, they will not be able to move from there. <lf><span color="Action"><lf>If you are unable to fight, press and hold <span color="Action">[</>] </> <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/> to return to the revival point. <lf><lf>Depending on the mission, there may also be a limit on the number of revivals. <lf><lf>If you get <lf>rescued by another player, the number of times you can revive won't decrease, so if you're unable to fight, ask them to help you by calling out with a stamp, etc.
Runo
The currency of this world is called “runo.” <lf>By <lf>consuming Luno, you can receive city services such as purchasing items. <lf>Runo can be obtained through quest rewards, item sales, etc. <lf>*Items can be sold from the “Asset Management Office.”
Mount Imagine
<lf>Mount Imagine can be equipped by going to <lf>“Character” > “Outfit and Mount” > “Mount Imagine” from the command menu. <lf><span color="Action">Once equipped, it can be mounted with <span color="Action">[</>] </><key color="Action" action="ImagineMount"/>.
<span color="Action">You can dash with <span color="Action">[</>] </> <key color="Action" action="Dash"/> while mounting. <lf>While you're <lf>dashing on the field, your dash gauge will decrease, and if you run out of gauge, you won't be able to dash. <lf><lf>The gauge will recover in a certain amount of time, so if you run out of gauge, try not dash for a while. <lf><lf><span color="Action">Some interactions <span color="Action">[</>] </> are restricted during mounting. <key color="Action" action="Interaction"/>
memory stand
<lf>On the memory stand, a “liquid memory effect” can be obtained by drinking drinks using activated liquid memory. There <lf>are various effects of liquid memory, such as “an increase in the number of items obtained through collection.” <lf>The effects disappear when you <lf>perform an action a fixed number of times, after a fixed period of time, etc., but it has a very convenient effect.
<lf>Liquid memory has multiple bottles with the same effect, and you can increase the number of times you use it and the amount of effects by drinking it all at once. <lf>Furthermore, it is also possible to obtain multiple liquid memory effects at the same time. <lf><lf><lf>Liquid memory is activated when specific actions determined for each bin are performed. <lf>It <lf>will slowly activate over time, so be sure to check when you restart the game, etc.

Enemy leader

Poison pool

Just avoid
Evasion has a fixed amount of time and timing to be invincible. <lf>If evasion is <lf>successful during invincible time, an effect will occur, and it will become “just evasion.” <lf>If you perform an evasion attack <lf>at this time, the performance of evasion attacks will improve, so let's determine the enemy's actions and aim for just evasion!
Aegis fighter
This is a close-range class that makes full use of offense and defense skills and plays an active role on the front line. <lf>Attract enemies and unleash powerful blows from the counter. <lf>The counter is strong, but you need to be careful with the “shield gauge.” <lf>If you defend an enemy's attack with a shield, your shield gauge will decrease. If you run out of <lf>shield gauges, you will not be able to use the shield for a certain period of time. <lf><lf><lf>Usable weapons... one-handed sword, shield, <lf>class gauge... shield gauge, ultimate skill... glitter mode

It's a close-range class where you launch continuous attacks with two axes. <lf>If you <lf>hit attacks continuously, the “combo gauge” will be accumulated and the damage dealt will increase.

Double Axe <lf>Class Gauge... Combo Gauge Ultimate Skill... Vortex Impact
<lf><lf>■ Twin Striker exclusive buff, Debuff 1 ignition... During the effect time of this skill, the combo gauge will be consumed, but the damage of other skills will increase.

spell caster
This is a long distance class that manipulates various attributes such as fire, ice, and thunder. <lf>Skills can be used continuously as long as there is an “EP”.

<lf><lf>■ Heavy Smasher exclusive buff, Debuff 1 lock body... now in Super Armor state, and a certain amount of damage is also invalidated. <lf><lf>2 Cure Cartridges... HP is restored when cartridges are consumed.

If the character's “class level” is higher than the <lf>specified value when participating in a mission, “level sync” will be applied. <lf><lf><lf>Level Sync does not affect HP, but damage etc. inflicted on enemies will be adjusted according to the appropriate class level.
The character rotates on the spot
<span color="Action"><lf>You can rotate the player character on the spot by inputting <span color="Action">[</>] </> <key color="Action" action="OrientToCamera" operateMode="MouseAndKeyboard"/> only when operating the keyboard.

Resurrecting from a state where combat is impossible
<lf><lf>If you are defeated by an enemy on the field, or if you fall from a height and become unable to fight, you will revive at a nearby revival point. <lf>It is also possible to revive on the spot by being rescued by other players nearby when you are <lf>unable to fight.

Number of respawns
<lf><lf>In missions where there is a limit on the number of revivals, if you consume a fixed number of revivals, you will not be able to revive on your own, and if you are forced to revive in that state, your capture will fail. <lf>Relief <lf>from other players isn't counted in the number of respawns, so be proactive in rescuing other players.

It's time to go to the field
Various enemies await you on the field. <lf><lf><lf>If an enemy is found, a yellow alert will be displayed, and if it is certified as an attack target, a red alert will be displayed, so be careful not to be taken by surprise before proceeding.
<lf>Also, by looking at an enemy's name plate, you can see the name and level of that enemy. <lf><lf>Enemies whose level is higher than your own will be less likely to cause damage even if they attack, and if there is a level difference above a certain level, this attack will not be able to inflict any damage. <lf>In particular, if you see a purple name plate, try to avoid it.

Evergreen desert
<lf>The Evergreen Desert is a pretty large area where adventurers rank 6 or higher can go. <lf>There is a town called <lf>Salamzat in the northwest, but there are countless adventurers who lost their lives before reaching it. <lf>Be prepared before taking on the challenge.

Let's aim higher and become an amazing adventurer!

Enemy nameplate
You can check the enemy's name and level on the nameplate. <lf>Enemies whose <lf>level is too high than the player cannot inflict damage, and even if they are defeated by any chance, they cannot gain experience points or items. <lf><lf>Conversely, you can also defeat enemies whose level is too low than the player, but you only get a very small amount of experience points. Take a <lf>look at the nameplate and fight enemies of the right strength. <lf><lf><lf>Also, there are information icons on the name plate, such as “enemies that haven't attacked you,” “<lf>bosses,” “named enemies,” and “targets to defeat through quests, etc.,” so please make use of them.
burst bonus
<lf>If you generate a burst by accumulating accumulated attribute values, the burst bonus time will be set for a fixed period of time. <lf><lf>Damage dealt is increased <lf>during bonus time, and there is also a bonus where damage dealt by Battle Imagine is even higher, so you can efficiently inflict damage in Battle Imagine. <lf><lf><lf>Also, during the burst bonus time, the burst finish gauge will be increased by accumulating attribute accumulation values. <lf>If you <lf>accumulate more than a certain amount of gauge, your burst finish level will increase, and you can increase the effect of finishing with the Burst Bonus. Let's <lf>raise the Burst Finish level and aim for big damage too!
chain
You can chain by quickly inflicting attacks in a row. <lf><lf><lf>If you connect a lot of chains, bonuses that increase damage will occur, and if you connect up to a specific number of chains, effects favorable to players, such as “continuous HP recovery” and “damage taken down,” will occur.
The number of chains is shared between you and your allies who have formed a party. <lf>If you get too far away from the player who <lf>is the party leader, you won't be able to receive the chain's effects, so be careful. <lf><lf><lf>The chain time that chains can be connected becomes shorter and shorter as the number of chains increases. <lf><lf>Also, if a chain is interrupted while a fixed number of chains are connected, the chain will not occur for a fixed period of time. <lf><lf>Once you've started a chain, be aware of connecting the chains as much as possible.

Enemy step jump
<lf>While jumping, you can step on an enemy by jumping again and perform a 2-step jump. <lf><lf>Close classes such as <lf>Aegis Fighter and Twin Striker jump straight up, while remote classes such as Spellcaster and Blast Archer jump backwards. <lf><lf>It <lf><lf>consumes a lot of stamina, but melee classes can perform assault attacks with advanced bonuses, and remote classes can keep you away from enemies all at once.
Ease of being targeted by enemies
<lf>If you damage enemies or heal allies, your ease of being targeted by enemies will increase. <lf>Enemies attack the player who is most likely to be targeted. <lf><lf>There are attacks that are easy to target and attacks that are difficult to raise, so watch the situation and control who is being targeted well.
ground target
<lf>In some attacks, when you hold down the button, a ground target is displayed. <lf>While the <lf>ground target is being displayed, the camera takes a slightly bird's-eye view, and an attack is triggered by releasing the button at the desired position.

I learned pioneering abilities
I cleared the goal tasks on the “Dragon Nail Weapon Board” and learned <lf>pioneering abilities [increase in the number of “Goblin Kiva” numbers]. <lf><lf>This has the effect that the number of pieces when acquiring the material item “Goblin Kiva” will be added by 1. <lf><lf>Pioneering abilities are often given as rewards for equipment adventure boards. <lf><lf><lf><lf>By learning, gathering materials for equipment will be much easier, so if you have pioneering abilities as rewards for adventure boards, be sure to complete the board and learn pioneering abilities.
Shared ability tier
<lf>Now that you've reached class level 30, shared ability slots for battle builds have been unlocked. <lf>You will be able to set shared abilities learned <lf>in other classes to the shared ability frame. <lf><lf>If you haven't experienced another class yet, it's a good idea to take this opportunity to try other classes.
Happy Nappo
<lf>There are times when pink napo and happy nappo stand in the field. <lf>There might be something good about finding a lot. As <lf>you explore the field, look carefully.
treasure chest
<lf><lf>Treasure chests placed in fields and dungeons, and treasure chests found when defeating enemies can be opened by interacting. <lf><lf>There are various things inside, such as consumer items and equipment, etc., and it seems that the more luxurious a treasure chest looks, the more luxurious the contents are. If you find <lf>treasure chests during your adventure, try opening them aggressively.
Battle Tips for Beginners
<lf>■Let's use direction derivation for normal attacks Derived attacks will appear by entering movement keys etc. in accordance with normal attacks. <lf><lf>Each class has unique derivative attacks, so check them out on the skill board. <lf>Also, in the avant-garde class, there is also an attack method called “Assault Attack.” Let's use it <lf>properly depending on the situation.
<lf><lf>■Let's take a close look at enemy movements There are cases where preliminary actions occur before a powerful attack, so be sure to carefully observe the enemy's movements. <lf>Instead of <lf>just avoiding, it's also a good idea to aim for just evasion, or try using guards wisely. <lf><lf><lf><lf>■Be aware of buffs and debuffs There are various types of buffs that strengthen yourself and your allies, and debuffs that weaken enemies. <lf>There are also things that are powerful <lf>enough to change the battle situation, so let's grasp the effects of each and master them.
<lf><lf><lf>■Let's hit enemy weak points If you master attributes such as hitting weak point attributes to efficiently inflict damage or generate attribute state abnormalities, battles will be easier. <lf><lf>First, let's be aware of the attributes of your weapons, battle imagination, and tactical skills. <lf><lf><lf><lf>■Let's think about when to use Battle Imagine ULT because these have long intervals, are highly effective, and have a big impact on battles. Let's <lf>estimate the war situation and use it when things are in a hurry.
Battle Tips Intermediate
<lf>■Be aware of enemy targets If you attack or heal, it will be easier for you to become enemy targets. <lf>Be careful not to let the target <lf>go to the back guard in the vanguard, and make sure that the rearguard doesn't take the target. <lf><lf>When <lf>you don't want to become a target, carefully evaluate the color of the hostility alert, attack when it's yellow, and devise ways such as suppressing the frequency of attacks.
<lf>■Let's check the abilities of the equipment Let's check the weapon's special effects and attributes, and Imagine's abilities. <lf><lf>Even with the same equipment, there are times when the special effects and abilities attached to it are different. <lf>Effects are added by adding multiple of the same abilities. <lf>Try searching for equipment with abilities that are more appropriate for your class and set it up. <lf><lf><lf><lf>■Let's devise battle builds, let's be aware not only of each effect, but also of the combinations, such as setting class abilities that can assist with things <lf>you're not good at, and battle imagines that have low damage but can inflict state abnormalities.
<lf><lf>■Let's train various classes When class level is 30, shared ability slots can be used, and shared class abilities for other classes can be set. <lf>Get <lf>shared class abilities from various classes and expand your range of battles.
Advanced Battle Tips
<lf><lf>■Let's connect chains As the number of chains in a party increases, the time it takes to connect chains becomes shorter. <lf><lf><lf>However, if the number of chains exceeds a certain number, buffs will be applied to strengthen the party, so let's connect the chains while being aware of the time remaining.
<lf><lf>■ Let's try devising battle builds · When conquering missions with 2 parties, try to make a battle build that is conscious of party play. <lf><lf><lf>Since <lf>it would be nice to have other players supplement your weak areas, it would be a good idea to make use of your strengths with party members and make up for your weaknesses, such as abandoning defense and specializing in attacks, or specializing in buffs and healing.
<lf><lf><lf>■Let's make use of the burst bonus During the burst bonus, not only do you accumulate accumulated attribute values and raise the burst finish level, but damage bonus multipliers are added to attribute attacks. <lf><lf>If it's an <lf>elemental attack from Battle Imagine, the bonus multiplier will increase even more, so let's aim aggressively.

Forbidden Trap
“Forbidden Trap” is a gimmick where a fence comes out of the floor. <lf>You <lf>can't pass through when the fence is out, and you have no choice but to aim for the timing when the fence retracts into the floor and get through. <lf><lf>There are also types where the fence is left out, so if it's a no-go trap that doesn't move, take a detour and proceed.

Npc_Feste
Player
If you're an adventurer, you have nothing to say about your livelihood. You can <cf>earn more than anything else!
e
Npc_Feste
Player
The first challenge is to defeat Land Fox. <cf>they might be too easy opponents for you
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
This is also part of the rules, so I'm sorry. <cf>That's great, how about devising ways to fight?
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
Use imagines, search for optimal terrain... I would be happy if you could make use of it in the <cf>future
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
The “Lake Reed Tunnel” is located in “Prairie of the Sound of the Sea.” <cf>Exploring this place is my second challenge
e
Npc_Murrie

<cf>Getting through an old tunnel where monsters have lived and get to the innermost part

<cf>I don't think it's that dangerous, but don't relax. Good luck!

Hey! rookie! How's it <cf>going?

Npc_Jake

This is me who scouted it. Please don't <cf>[stop] at the registration exam, okay?

Npc_Jake

Well, there's no reason my eyes are crazy though! It's <cf>easy work for you!
e
Npc_Jake

I'm looking forward to the Success report. <cf>Good Luck!
e
Npc_Jake
Player
Hey! rookie! It seems that <cf>defeating Land Fox is an issue
e
Npc_Jake
Player
Foo... I was underestimated. It's not the kind of monster that would be your <cf>opponent
e
Npc_Jake
Player
Clean up quickly with “The Prairie of the Sound of the Sea.” <cf>The actual performance will come after that. Relaxation up!
e
Npc_Jake
Player
Hey! it's here, isn't it? You're going to the <cf>“Lake Reed Tunnel,” aren't you?
e
Npc_Jake
Player
That place is pretty long all the way to the back. If you think about it in the same way as <cf>“Cliff Ruins,” it hurts
e
Npc_Jake
Player
There might also be unexpected incidents. <cf>However, it is also the adventurer's ability to cope with that
e
Npc_Jake
Player
HAHAHA! Well, don't worry. Most things would be <cf>fine if it were you. solid!

<cf>The number of outings will increase, and don't forget to raise your Adventurer rank on the Adventure Board, right?
e

Player
That too is definitely a legacy of Bavaria, isn't it? People <cf>who achieve more are evaluated as excellent adventurers
e
Npc_Coin_Owner

<cf>It seems like Jake's guy is cleaning up a ridiculous number of sheets

That's because there are places you can't go if your rank is low. <cf>There's no loss at last, so do your best

Npc_Poirier
Player
what are you doing <cf>The “souvenir exchange” is right around the corner, isn't it?
e
Npc_Feste

The third challenge is “weapon crafting.” Listen to the story from <cf>Huovi in Craftsmen's Square
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
Get the weapon that works best for you. <cf>Because this is also one of the qualities an adventurer needs

e
Npc_Murrie
Player
Hey! Are the exams going well? <cf>The next one was about crafting weapons
e
Npc_Jake
Player
Weapons are an important partner for adventurers. That's because it's <cf>literally the partner you entrust your life to
e
Npc_Jake
Player
<cf>Depending on the purpose and situation, there are times when you fight while changing various weapons
e
Npc_Jake
Player
I hope you listen carefully to Huovi's guy!
e
Npc_Jake
Player
How about crafting weapons? <cf>I wonder if I was able to make what I was told
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
<cf>If you make a new weapon, show it to Huovi
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
This is the last assignment for the registration exam, isn't it? <cf>The last one is “ENHANCED IMAGINE CRAFT”
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
<cf>The Poirier at the Imagine Institute is in charge, so you should ask her to listen to the story
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
<cf>Powa is a serious kid, and I think it will end without any particular trouble
e
Npc_Murrie

Once this is over, you'll be fine and adventurer. <cf>Just try a little harder!
e
Npc_Murrie
Player
The exam is finally final!
e
Npc_Jake
Player
Is it an enhanced imagination craft? <cf>That's also basic knowledge if you're an adventurer
e
Npc_Jake
Player
<cf>The survival rate of adventurers changes drastically depending on whether Enhanced Imagine is there or not
e
Npc_Jake

<cf>Skillful adventurers are monsters who wear such good enhanced imagination

Tell your thoughts to pay the bill. <cf>It's just amazing piling up, man...

Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
Incursions, this place was only open to the public for limited ceremonies such as the investiture ceremonies of the high priest.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
But why was permission granted to you outsiders...?
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
I see... You're starting to look good as an adventurer. <cf>It feels like you've felt a pretty tired challenge.
;
Npc_Jake
Player
That's got a real license. <cf>It's been a while since I've seen one.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
Adventurers, Adventurers are not allowed to enter alone. <cf>In most cases, they are separated by someone else with the Bafaria teenagers.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
This is a rare case, but <cf>this must be the Will of the God of Bafaria.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
If you have a permit, there's nothing to say. <cf>Please come in.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
[It is asking too many questions about those who have been leaving entry to the Mihashira.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
So I don't hear anything. <cf>Also, that lady appeared to be quite tired.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
You should rest immediately. <cf>Now, relax to Lalpal.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
It's taking a while for him to come back... <cf>No, I'm talking about my feelings.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
After You All Left the [Mihashira], <cf>I Can't Help But Wonder What Was Inside
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
[SOMETHING TO SHINE AT THE TOP OF THE PILLAR... <cf>Well, it's the work of God. There's nothing we can do about it.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
This is the “Mihashira of the Gods.” The Sacred Ground of Our God. <cf>All events are to be accepted as fate.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_All
... please be quiet.
;
Npc_PilgrimPriest
Npc_PilgrimPriest
Hey! What did you think of “Kamigakari no Mihashira”?
;
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
Did you find anything, like a visitor or a clue to your memories?
;
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
Well, if it's a miss, that's ok. <cf>You'll find out teenagers. Don't worry.
;
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
A person who used to work with me on security guard <cf>duty something happened to me...
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
He said he was really tired about the state of the [Mihashira] and climbed up without listening to listening to those who listened to stop him.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
It's unconscious, but he's tired in the line of duty. <cf>I'll continue to stand here so that I won't bring someone to him.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
The previous gatekeeper was a serious guy.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
Hmm, do you know? <cf>I see... Then please remember me from time to time.
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
I was told not to go, but I went to the [Mihashira]. <cf>I wish I wasn't so excited to my work...
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
What, are you guys still here?
;
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
They say not to enter the [Mihashira], right?

Okay, okay. <cf>If you're done, leave now.

I have to go and free Avaritia feels...
K
Npc_Aerinse
Player
E
Hey, can you tell me a bit about how ChronoLeap works?
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Oh, I'm not exploiting to exploit you or anything, you know? <cf>I'm just genuinely curious, you know? Yes!
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Yes, a little is okay. <cf>I trust you guys. right?
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
Ggh...! Don't look at me with such pure eyes. <cf>It's hard to deal with someone who trusts you so innocently.
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Hmm, well... that's how Chrono Leap works, right? <cf>Of course, you need the device that was in the [Mihashira]...
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
To travel through time and space, a special fuel called “Chronogram” is required.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Chronogram?
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
YES The Larger the Time Jump, The More Chronicles are Relaxed.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
However, chronicles are chronicles...
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
With the amount of material I had prepared, it was all I could do to make the jump to this era with just Tirith and me.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Then, when you jumped with us...
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Oh, that's okay. <cf>It was only a few hours, so I didn't get tired much.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
If You and Tiris Go Back to Your Time Together, <cf>The Maths Will Tell You Something.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
I see. <cf>By the way, how to make that chronogram is [--]
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Hehe, it's a secret
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Tch, I guess it's not that easy after all
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Now that I think of it, why is Elinze <cf>so excited?
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
... The device's <cf>energy supply source was broken.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
In order to activate it in that state, the activator must energize their own energy<cf>... engrams.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Lord Elinze must have shaved down his own engrams to the limit in order to save us.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
This person is someone who seems to do such things without being afraid.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Is that so... Well, well, well. <cf>Give him a rest.
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
YES I will give you a rest even if it means risking my life.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
I've heard stories about it for a while now... <cf>It feels like that the Dragon King has finally died.
K
Npc_Jake
Player
With this guy at the top, it seems like The Disunited Dragon Tribe has come together.
K
Npc_Jake
Player
what...? <cf>Did you meet the Dragon King Voldigen?
K
Npc_Jake
Player
Hey, hey, I'm sorry you're safe...! <cf>No matter what, you're not being able to fight I can fight
K
Npc_Jake
Player
Don't think of anything stupid. <cf>Survival is also an important mission of an adventurer.
K
Npc_Jake
Player
Even so, why does the uncomfortable look so sad?

[“] If You Have That Kind of Free Time, Get a Job [”] is What My Wife Told Me.
K

Is that really the case? <cf>Isn't it the case that you just have to do your job?
K
npc_worshiper

My girlfriend is very beautiful
K

I'm praying right now, so <cf>please leave me alone.

Mom, what about 'Otabisho Cookie'?
K

You said you'd buy it for me!

As we have said, information about Chronoleap is highly recommended.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Player
Of Course, The Same Goes for “Chronogram” <cf>Please choose from relaxation about it.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Player
By the way, senpai, <cf>do you think we'll be able to get the 'Luminous Core'?
K
Npc_Tyris
Player
As Feste said sorry, there is a high chance of finding it at the Bafaria ruins.

What's changed recently? <cf>Oh... now that I think of it, I heard a strange noise near the village.
<
Npc_Villager
Player
What was that? <cf>It sounded like a living room thing, but also like it wasn't...
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Thoughts, it was the creepiest sound I've ever heard...
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Are you an adventurer? <cf>If so, could you please go and check it out?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
There's a hut beside a nearby bridge, and on the way there, I saw a strange shadow.
<
Npc_Villager
Player
That Shadow Scissors the Hunter's Passage... <cf>How should I put it, I had a really bad feeling about it...
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Hey you! <cf>Be willing if you explore around here!
<
Npc_Villager
Player
It feels like that a very tough monster has died in the southwest. <cf>It's Rumored That Your Average Adventurer Can't Stand A Chance Against It!
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Traveler. Have you seen the Bafarian pilgrims?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
This village is also included in the pilgrimage route. <cf>It's a small village with nothing in it, so it's a blessing.
<
Npc_Villager
Player
I thought I'd at least give you something to cheer you up. <cf>I thought I'd serve you a dish made with the yamaimo (Japanese yam) that we eat around here.
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Will I wonder if the Oracle Priestess will be tired?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Oh, you guys. <cf>Did you do something?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
The Strange Noises coming from the mountain have been stopped. <cf>It was creepy. I'm relieved
<
Npc_Villager
Player
But what was that? <cf>That weird sound? that voice?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
What was in the Hunter's Passage?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Oh, no need to say that! <cf>There must have been some weird monsters there, right?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
You want them, right? <cf>Well, that's fine. Thank you very much.
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Hey! How was that tough monster!?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Oh, you wanted it! That's amazing!
<
Npc_Villager
Player
It's a blessing to have a strong adventurer like you!
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Hey, are you in the same business? <cf>If so, you'd be better off.
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I heard that a formable monster fighter in the Hunter's Passage. <cf>It's A Monster I've Never Seen Before, and It's Strongly Strong.
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
And I'm the woman who will leave him and make a name for myself!
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
... But we're not fully prepared yet. <cf>Be excited, be tired...
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Oh, I found some rust on my equipment. <cf>I'll have to get some new stuff.
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Also, I don't think I have all the items yet... <cf>I need to buy some more of these too.
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The Monster That Scissors in the Hunter's Passage... <cf>It was busy.
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
N-no. It's a good thing that you were tired. <cf>Yeah
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The problem is that I defeat on the task of defeating the monster. <cf>If I had been tired, it would have been over.
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I guess I'll say I hate him... <cf>No, but... I don't have any evidence...
<
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The adults told me not to go outside the town. <cf>Because they said I could hear the voices of monsters.
<
npc_boy_common
Player
I can't hear that voice hurts... <cf>That Means the Monster has been busy, right?
<
npc_boy_common
Player
Oh, thank goodness. <cf>I had to attend all the activities I could do at home.
<
npc_boy_common
Player
The Monster in the Hunter's Passage has been busy. <cf>I don't know who did it, but I'm tired.
<
Npc_Villager
Player
It didn't happen like it was done by Adventurers by the village. <cf>So it was done by a strange adventurer?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
If you don't give your name... <cf>Are you a saint who doesn't need fame or reward?
<
Npc_Villager
Player
Or maybe there was some other reason. <cf>I really wanted to thank you, but...

Player
Even if it's slow, if it's slow, if it's for a long time, it's not good. <cf>You can't beat age.
Npc_Atl_Citizen

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I guess I'll just have to put this on hold.
Npc_Shopkeeper

Was there a store in a place like this?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Oh no, the basic crafting fee is cheap! <cf>Ah, but I have to keep using it for half a year...
Npc_Adventurer
Player
When I think about thinking about it... it's a bit tricky. <cf>It's not bad if I use it for a long time, but it would be a problem if it.
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Hmmmm... I'm having a hard time leaving. <cf>I wonder which one is better value for money...
Npc_Adventurer
Player
These stairs are a shortcut to [Gaimon Square]
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I'm going to climb up
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
If you go down this slope, you will reach the harbor.
Npc_girl_common
Player
My dad works at Minato
Npc_girl_common
Player
Today, a very important item will arrive.
Npc_girl_common
Player
Did you know? This tree was a gift from the Duchy of Barnhardt as a token of friendship.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Isn't it wonderful? <cf>Strong branches, wide and deep roots...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
IT'S AS IF HE EMBODIES THE COUNTRY THAT IS THE LEADER OF THIS PLANET!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Long Live The Duchy of Barnhardt! <cf>Long Live My Spice!!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
My Thoughts asked me to look after the store, but <cf>there's nothing there for them to see!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
THIS IS THE SCHOOL WHERE MY CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The school is run by the Bafaria Church, and school <cf>is free to hate.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Priests also act as teenagers. <cf>They teach me all kinds of things.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Not just the doctrine and history of the cult, but also the use of foreign words and the Bafaria heritage.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The colleges of schools like these must be a major factor in the spread of Bafariaism among the people.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I am married this mansion. <cf>what is that?
npc_securityGuard
Player
You... Darely You Don't Know the Ganador Family?
npc_securityGuard
Player
Haruka, You're a Noble Family That Has Worked Hard for the Scenes of the City for Generations, Ever Since Asterlies Was Strange.
npc_securityGuard
Player
Let me be clear. <cf>This family is not of the same class as ordinary people.
npc_securityGuard
Player
If you want, don't want around here. <cf>If you do anything stupid, we'll catch you!
npc_securityGuard
Player
This is “Muu Tree Square”
Npc_Vendor
Player
That's what the tree in the center of the square is called.
Npc_Vendor
Player
The Mu Tree is said to be named after the Legendary Priest of the Barnhardt Parish, Lord Muwel...
Npc_Vendor
Player
It is also said that this is because of the “moooo” noise that the wind makes when it passes through the gaps in the trunk.
Npc_Vendor
Player
Why do such extreme legends show <cf>up?
Npc_Vendor
Player
The store is closed for the day. <cf>It doesn't matter what time it is.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I'm dressed up on my mood that day!
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Sorry, young man. <cf>This is my reserved seat.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
IT'S NICE TO DRINK BEVERAGE IN A CORNER. <cf>Well, it's not bad to be lively, either.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Once upon a time, this place was a rundown, rundown bar. <cf>I've been worried here since then.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's a great shop now. People of all ages, both men and women, can enjoy it side by side. IT'S ALL THANKS TO THE OWNER'S HORIZONS.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Mmm, it was delicious! <cf>The meat was so tender.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I don't know how many stores like this, so <cf>you told me about a great place!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Hey, let's have something sweet next time. <cf>Want to take a walk?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I wonder <cf>I'm sure the food at this restaurant is delicious!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
So, what are we going to do next?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I'd like to go probably else if possible. <cf>Well, if you're okay with that, but...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Silver sandfish is in season now
npc_boy_common
Player
And the octopus at dusk. <cf>Sea honey and mussel shells
npc_boy_common
Player
Gae is good for dried fish, Hinagi sashimi, <cf>Makanagi is a bit dried so...
npc_boy_common
Player
<cf>Oogori, Tonosappa, Sasisbashiri, Nibenibe and Inaina...
npc_boy_common
Player
I'm a bit curious... <cf>Huh? What do you mean?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That's the girl over there. <cf>Look, she's in the white seat on the balcony facing the sea...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
She's been glancing at me for a while now. <cf>... I wonder if she likes me?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I'm just curious... <cf>Huh? What do you mean?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That guy over there. <cf>Look, he's drinking alone at the standing bar...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
He's been glancing at me for a while now. <cf>... What if he's a stalker?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Hey, come in!
Npc_Barker
Player
It's cheap! It's delicious! <cf>And as an added bonus, it's fresh!
Npc_Barker
Player
This is Asterliese's Pride and Joy, a Market Where Fish Are Scissors from Oceans All Over the World!
Npc_Barker
Player
Come on in, have a look! <cf>And buy one extra!
Npc_Barker
Player
Ahh! ... it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit... <cf>No matter how many times I count, it doesn't fit
Npc_Worker
Player
... No, I just received a suggestion from a business partner from Barnhardt.
Npc_Worker
Player
No matter how many times I count, the numbers don't match the catalog
Npc_Worker
Player
I WATCH THE SHIPS FROM HERE EVERY DAY.
Npc_girl_common
Player
There's an Island Inhabited by Mermaids Far, Far Away!
Npc_girl_common
Player
Who is this? Who made such a mess?! <cf>And what's more, they just left it there!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
And what is this picture? <cf>I have no idea
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Oh, you? <cf>Are you going to clean it up for me?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Don't be such a busybody. <cf>Let them deal with this on their own.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Maybe I should put up a notice
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Welcome
Npc_Vendor
Player
Whoa! D-Don't let the fish get so close!
Npc_Vendor
Player
It's fishy and slimy. <cf>I just can't stand it.
Npc_Vendor
Player
I have to help out at home, so I can't slack off... <cf>Oh, I'm so excited...
Npc_Vendor
Player
Come on! <cf>How about some fresh fish stew?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Fried, fried, stewed, salad, <cf>soup, pasta, anything goes!
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Specially selected seafood, a specialty of Asterliese! <cf>IT'S COOKING RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT!
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Oh, sir! You have a nice bighead! <cf>Would you like me to prepare it for you?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I RUN A SMALL BISTRO AND I ALWAYS COME HERE TO BUY SUPPLIES.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Not only are they fresh, but sometimes you can find rare fish.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Oh. There's A Six-Star Starfish here. <cf>It's not edible, but it's a sign of good luck.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Something good might happen today
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Crane is not a working teenager. <cf>I asked for teenagers, but they never came.
Npc_Worker
Player
I thought I could do something about myself, so I started pounding it hard, and then [--]
Npc_Worker
Player
He stopped eating anything. <cf>I guess you have to be an expert to do this.
Npc_Worker
Player
Even though I look like this, I used to be a sailor.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I've been to the Duchy of Barnhardt many times. <cf>And that's not all. I've been to the Outer Continents Too.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
A Big Liner is nice, but it's also nice to venture out on the ocean with just your own two hands.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
There are many lands in the world that have yet to be lost. <cf>I would be happy if young people could discover them.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
What the hell? <cf>There's Been A Lot of Cancellations Rejected.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
They say that dragons everywhere, so <cf>maybe it can't be scared
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Thanks to you, we don't make any business. <cf>The Sailors' Lodges Are Deserted.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Oh no, no. <cf>Can't someone get rid of the dragons?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
What am I doing? Can't you see? <cf>I'm working on my car.
Npc_Worker
Player
This is my job. <cf>I HAVE TO FEED MY LITTLE BROTHER.
Npc_Worker
Player
That girl also likes cars and tricks to have some knowledge, but <cf>it's pretty hard work.
Npc_Worker
Player
If you want to craft, <cf>listen at the bottom of these stairs.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I saw
Npc_girl_common
Player
A GREEN NAPPO COMES OUT OF THAT FLOWER BED.
Npc_girl_common
Player
I'm not alone. There are many. <cf>One after another they marched off their feet.
Npc_girl_common
Player
But no one wants me
Npc_girl_common
Player
How about a vase? <cf>IT'S MADE BY A BEAUTIFUL TOUCH POTTER.
Npc_Vendor
Player
I'll tell you something good. <cf>... That Potter is not human.
Npc_Vendor
Player
The truth is... there are dragons disguised as enemies and <cf>they are secretly making vases...!
Npc_Vendor
Player
... Just kidding! That would be awesome. <cf>So, what do you think? Would you like to buy one?
Npc_Vendor
Player
I sell rare spices from around the world.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I chose around here and there myself and had a good eye for it.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
By the way, there was a rumor that a summit was going to be held in Salamzahd, where we were wearing goods.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
It fights that the Knight Commander of Barnhardt will also be afraid. <cf>He's busy fighting the dragon tribe.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Come on, it's cheap! <cf>You can find all kinds of fruits from around the world!
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
... Anything is an excuse. <cf>It will be in order to some extent!
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
... To some extent, I dimensioned. <cf>It will be a little bit! ... I think it will be a little bit.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I SHOULD HAVE BEAUTY FOR A BEAUTY STORE...
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
The Brightest Star in the Night Sky is Athens
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
He is the Incarnation of the Bafaria God who saved the Earth. <cf>The honorable name was given to the star.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
IT'S GOOD TO LISTEN TO OLD STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
You Might Hear Something Wrong
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
This slope is “Pineapple Street”
Npc_Vendor
Player
Back in the day, during the pineapple boom, there were restaurants as many as 30 specialty stores bought together.
Npc_Vendor
Player
It treats that they put pineapple in everything, not only food and drinks, but also detergents, cosmetics, etc.
Npc_Vendor
Player
In the end, the pineapple was tending the store by sweets. <cf>It felt like it was so amazing that excited like that started to spread.
Npc_Vendor
Player
I don't know what weapon suit me best...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
But in times like these, the best thing to do is try different things.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Get used to it, not worry! <cf>Try it out, you might discover something new!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Well, I don't have any money so I'm just tired...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The GREEN NAPPO IS MY FRIEND
Npc_girl_common
Player
Purple Napo-kun is a little scary
Npc_girl_common
Player
Nappo-kun, please don't bully him too much
Npc_girl_common
Player
If You Go Up the Hill, You Will Find the “Reclamation Bureau”
npc_securityGuard
Player
Go down the stairs and you'll reach the Craftsmen's Square
npc_securityGuard
Player
Welcome! <cf>We have a variety of rare items!
npc_boy_common
Player
I got it all the way from Salamzahd! <cf>Please buy me something
npc_boy_common
Player
Salamzahd is Far Away. <cf>It's beyond the plateau, the valley, and the desert.
npc_boy_common
Player
You'd better prepare for a long journey.
npc_boy_common
Player
Sorry. This is a warehouse. <cf>My shampoo has been tired junk here.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
There are so many sellers so many to sell. <cf>Ahahaha!
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
The shop is on Donkey Street, so please take a look. <cf>My little boy is working there, so you'll know the right away.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Oh, I'm a Blacksmith. <cf>But I don't deal with relaxation.
Npc_Craftsman
Player
I don't want to retype it. Sorry.
Npc_Craftsman
Player
I vested not to get fights in fighting fights...
Npc_Craftsman
Player
I Will Never Fight the Battle That Daughters My Daughter from Him...
Npc_Craftsman
Player
It depends that suicide machine vandalism has become popular recently.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
That's why I'm tired a watchful eye.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Hmm! My Eyes Are Blurred... <cf>I guess I'm getting old too. Oh dear.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
... You, <cf>You Didn't Do Anything to the Incurable Machine Just Now, Did You?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Well, which should I choose... <cf>Mufufufufufu...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Huh? ... what's up with that old man? <cf>Why are you always looking at me?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's so hard to buy
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I'd be hungry if people found out I was a secret fan of ``Aster Tropical ☆ Grilled Shrimp Miso Flavor”...!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I have a poster up. <cf>I made one.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Store cafes, live snacks. <cf>We can do anything from flyers to signs.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
If you need anything, please come join us to our atelier at Port Asterliese.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Well, even I call it an atelier, I'm just using the landing of the stairs at the wharf.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
This slope is called “Donkey Street”
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It is said that the name comes from the fact that a donkey loaded with goods to be unloaded at the store would go back and forth many times.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's Not Seen Much These Days Yesterday
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Donkeys are gentle and strong, and are <cf>man's precious friends.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Whew, I've done too much shopping. <cf>I was just going to walk through...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
This slope is a shortcut from Gaimon Square, but there are so many shops that I always end up taking a detour.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
If you're in a situation, just keep walking without looking back
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Blue sea... White waves ebbing and boiling...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
A bright beach... shining parasols...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Light of Youth... The Thoughts I've Lost...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That cheater oooooooooooooo!! <cf>Get shampoo in a barrel and drift away shampoo!!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Oh, there's balloon oil!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
My shampoo Salamzahd is famous for its many floating balloons.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
They are used as relaxation and in the desert, but <cf>there is a custom of writing a wish on them.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
When Your Wish Comes True, Release the Balloon into the Sky <cf>This amazing back memories. I think I'll try making one again after a long time.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Wow, what a beautiful view! <cf>I've always wanted a balcony with a view of the ocean~
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I'm glad I'm happy this house~
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Population of Asterlies is harmful enough, and it seems like there won't be enough housing.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Good properties sell noodles. <cf>If you like it, there's no time to lose.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I love this house because it has a nice view.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
where?! <cf>I can see the ocean!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even if I say, they just brush me off by hand that they don't know the location of other houses...
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Damn, damn! I've been tricked!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
This is the main venue of the Asteria Opera House
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Sadly, there will be no events for a while. <cf>Thought the “Star Spirit Festival” would have been held, but...
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
There's Been No Longer Yet This Year. <cf>I'm looking forward to it too.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
I can't wait to see the divas on stage
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
If you go up this hill, you'll reach the temple.
npc_boy_common
Player
The Pilgrimage Temple in the World! <cf>That I've ever seen it!
npc_boy_common
Player
Don't be afraid! <cf>THEY SAY YOU CAN'T HEAR A SONG THAT HAS STOPPED!
npc_boy_common
Player
[“] The important thing is to always keep a cool head and see things through to the end [”]<cf>. I was pregnant that at school the other day!
npc_boy_common
Player
Across the Sea is the Asteria Plain.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That Crumbling Tower is the Ruins of Baphalia.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's almost broken... That's right. <cf>It's broken to be broken, but the pieces are floating in the air.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Adventurers go to ruins like that to solve mysteries, right? <cf>That's amazing.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Wow, what a splendid garden!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
As Expected from the Great Temple of the Bafaria Church. <cf>They must have a lot of money to spare.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
No, no, it's fine. <cf>I'm a filthy person with little faith.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
As long as the lights are on and the water is running, I don't want anything more.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Tch... <cf>The Guards' eyes are shining here too.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Whoa!? Wh, what's that? I'm just an old man brought by.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I have no idea how stupid I would be to sneak into the temple from here!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Eh, ahhh! Just let's go hungry!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
This is the Bafaria Temple. <cf>Welcome.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
You May Pray to Your Heart's Content. <cf>The Temple is open to everyone.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Of course, there are disbelievers, but we, the Order's guards, will not let such people through.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
As long as we keep an eye on you, you can't get close to the temple. <cf>Don't worry. ha ha ha!
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
From here onwards, this is a sacred place. <cf>Please relax from making noise or getting tired away.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Of course, business is no good either.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
This wonderful place that injured people even without anything is meant to be used by others than the cult...
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Ahem, ahem! <cf>Decent, what's no good is no good!
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Hey, would it be OK if I set up a stall here?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
There's no competition here, so <cf>I think it'll work.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Oh, the guard is looking at me... <cf>He's looking at me in a rather serious way.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
What the hell, stingy? <cf>THE GOOD SPOTS IN TOWN ARE TAKEN TAKEN.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Eh?! Don't be hasty?!
Npc_Believer
Player
Don't get me long. <cf>I love the sunrise from here.
Npc_Believer
Player
But I was tired by your kindness.
Npc_Believer
Player
Let's teach you something good as a thank you
Npc_Believer
Player
Try going to a remote area once in a while. <cf>Your map will expand
Npc_Believer
Player
Entry into the basement is a bathroom
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Well, when I got off, the door was locked.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Deep Within the Temple Are Precious Treasures and the Relics of Bafaria.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
You have a very good reason unless you have a very good reason. <cf>Go home shampoo.
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
I came here because I wanted to meet the “Oracle Maiden”
Npc_Believer
Player
He is the highest-ranking member of the Bafaria musicians.
Npc_Believer
Player
She is a special shrine maiden who says the words of the God of Bafaria as oracles and conveys them to us.
Npc_Believer
Player
But there is no way such a noble person would be in a place like this.
Npc_Believer
Player
Only One “Oracle Priestess” is meant for each generation.
Npc_Priest
Player
Receive an Oracle from God [--] This Duty Can Only Be Assured by Those with Special Powers.
Npc_Priest

Who will be determined and how? <cf>Only God knows.

Npc_Priest
Player
This Light Must Not Be Refreshed
Npc_Priest
Player
This is a light that was split off from the light of hope that the god of Baphalia once bestowed upon the desolate earth.
Npc_Priest
Player
As long as this light shine to shine, we can continue to receive God's grace.
Npc_Priest
Player
When this light is refreshed, hope is also refreshed. <cf>okay? This Light Must Not Be Refreshed
Npc_Priest
Player
What a big temple! Did you know that this temple is the <cf>Bafaria Ruins?
Npc_Believer
Player
This place is huge, but inside the ruins, the “Kamigakari no Mihashira” (Pillar of the Gods) is also amazing.
Npc_Believer
Player
It is one of the largest ruins on the Bahamar Valley and is said to be a pleasure in terms of its beauty.
Npc_Believer
Player
Delayed, it's amazing, but I haven't seen it yet.
Npc_Believer
Player
... It has been taken since the Holy Land of Bafaria has been taken.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
The world wants to want to blame the dragons... <cf>Yes, that's right. We know that.
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
There's No Longer About It. “They” have moved on...!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
We are the only ones who knows the truth... <cf>You know what to do... right?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
... that's stupid, it's too early!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
How dare you lay hands on the Holy Land of Bafaria...! <cf>What are “they” thinking?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
We are the only ones who are aware of the danger facing the world...! <cf>What a lonely battle...!
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Is There A Friend Who Can Share This Feeling With Me?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
The God of Baphalia resides in the heavens
Npc_Priest
Player
God died the earth to us <cf>moved and moved to the sky
Npc_Priest
Player
Can you see the “Heavenly Patterns” that somehow the sky? <cf>That is the proof left behind by the God of Bafaria.
Npc_Priest
Player
May you look up at the sky and shine <cf>to God be engraved in your heart.
Npc_Priest
Player
Sorry. I'm still tired.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
We are planning to sell the Bafaria Legacy. <cf>However, the finished product is too comfortable for me to afford.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I'm looking to buy and sell broken parts and junk parts.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I might ask some adventurers for help. <cf>I'll be counting on you then.
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Hey you, do you know?
Npc_Vendor
Player
She is the “Oracle Priestess” of the Bafaria Priests. <cf>To go on a pilgrimage at a time like this?

Npc_Vendor
Player
That's true for any job, right? <cf>It's good to get into the habit of habitual things in detail.
Npc_Vendor

It says that there are such places in faraway foreign countries. <cf>Bon something, Wabi something, etc...

“Flux” is different from normal monsters. <cf>You'll know it when you see it.

Did you hear that? Did you hear something loud at the top of the “Mihashira” of the “Kamigakari”?
?
npc_worshiper
Player
That was a really loud noise... <cf>I hope it's not a sign of something bad hate.

“Something flew to the top of the [Mihashira] of [Kamigakari]! <cf>It was shining, and it was so bright!”

And then there was this amazing noise! <cf>A REALLY BIG BOOM!

npc_boy_common
Player
what is that? Maybe the God of Baphalia?
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Lalpal here can be said to be a temple town of the sacred place “Kamigakari no Mihashira”.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Look, can you get a good view of the “Kamigakari no Mihashira” from here too, right?
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Many musicians come to the shrine, so it's quite lively and convenient the town's size.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
The Large Number of People Praying is also an Incurable to Us, The Order's Guardians.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
what? Do you also believe the gods that the Dragons are attacking the Holy Land?
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
That can't be true. <cf>It's just a rumor. Lalpal is fine.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
The God of Baphalia would never permit such a thing!
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Just a rumor. Just a rumor!
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
There's no way that the dragon tribe would have attacked. <cf>Even now, there are so many guards here.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
All the cult guards are hardworking. <cf>We are going to make you want to drink.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
You too should not be misled by such misses.

“The [Mihashira] of [Kamigakari]” <cf>The Entire Building, including the Tower, is a Heritage of Bafaria.

Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
However, the Statue of the Beings of the Bafarian Festival in front... <cf>It didn't mean that it wasn't there anyway.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard

It is said that after the unexpected passed away, the people of that time expanded the building.

Npc_Bapharia_Guard

The “Mihashira” of the “Kamigakari” is very beautiful...

Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Around Ralpal, you can see the “Mihashira of the Gods” from anywhere, but...
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
From here, the cliff blocks the view of the “Kamigakari no Mihashira” (Pillar of the Gods).
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
<cf>I like to see the “Mihashira” of the “Kamigakari,” so that's a bit displeased.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
This is the shopping district of Lalpal. <cf>It's a bustling shopping district for the size of the town, isn't it?
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Not only the restaurants of Lalpal but also worshippers visit this shopping street.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
That's why we carry a lot of products for musicians and adventurers.

Npc_Bapharia_Guard

You might want to check out the store too.

Npc_Villager
Player
Belkmar is a village in the Valley East of Lalpal.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
The Rumor is that it was discovered by some unknown monsters and monsters<cf>.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It's a scary story. <cf>I'm so tired I can't sleep.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Do you see that there? At the bottom of the cliff. <cf>It's the village of Bergmar.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I GUESS IT'S BETTER TO CALL IT THE BETTER OF BERGMAR... <cf>It's relaxing shampoo.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
THE STORY GOES THAT A MONSTER THROUGH AND JUST THAT TO SURPRISE...
?
Npc_Villager
Player
What kind of monster would kill and cause the whole village to kill...?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I spoke to the shrine maiden for the first time! <cf>She was a wonderful person...
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
The “Oracle Priestess.” <cf>She's a very important person in the Bafaria ceremony.
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
I came to Lalpal with a group of Bapharian pilgrims.
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
If you had come to a little shrine maiden, you would have been able to meet the shrine maiden.
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
The Pilgrims felt refreshed up, so I was a bit tired.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Unlikely, you won't come at this time of year.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
... I wonder if it has something to do with that after all.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Look, Bergmar's... <cf>It's scary, really.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It appeared that a pilgrim group from the Bafarian explanation was heading to Belkmal.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
This is a very sweet story.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I had symptoms in Bergmar.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I ask all pilgrims to please pray for me too.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Recently, a pilgrim group stopped at Lalpal, and <cf>they had a lot of trouble.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Some people were complacent about the pilgrims. <cf>It got a little tense
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I think the cause is probably the Bergkmar incident.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Everyone is busy. <cf>What is God doing?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
What was that just now...?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
No, I heard a really loud noise. <cf>It was like a big thunderclap.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
The Sound Came from the Direction of the Pillars... <cf>It doesn't hurt like anything's long.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Hmm, maybe I misheard.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I really saw it! <cf>I'm not worried!
?
npc_boy_common
Player
For a moment, a shadow fell on the ground...
?
npc_boy_common
Player
I felt up at the sky and saw something whizz by at incredible speed!
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Which way did I go to? <cf>I'm pretty sure it was the “Mihashira of the Gods”
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Hey there, Fellows. <cf>Are you heading out there too?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
If so, be afraid. <cf>I hear it's pretty dangerous down there.

Npc_Adventurer
Player
Well, so what's the point?

Npc_Adventurer
Player
You and I, that<cf>'s what we do as adventurers because we want to enjoy it.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Decent you've also come to take on a request from this mansion?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
That would be a surprise. I was the first to receive this request.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Just by the mansion, you can get a lot of rewards.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
There's no way I could miss out on such a great offer, right?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Lalpal is close to the “Mihashira of the Gods,” so I thought it was a more solemn place.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
But judging from the stalls, it seems like a normal town.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Look <cf>They sell cookies and wooden dolls.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
... Is it a normal town or does it seem like a tourist spot?
?
Npc_Adventurer

Hey, young man. <cf>How about a bottle to drink you on your journey?

Npc_Shopkeeper

?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Well, when it comes to sweets from Lalpal, it's these Onbashira cookies!
?
npc_boy_common
Player
A warm and fluffy wheat flavor <cf>with a rich butter flavor!
?
npc_boy_common
Player
You're like, “It's just a normal cookie.” <cf>It even comes with the protection of the Buffalian God!
?
npc_boy_common
Player

?
npc_boy_common
Player
Oh, sorry, adventurer. <cf>The store is still under construction.

Npc_Villager
Player
The barrels in this cart contain milk. <cf>However, it's only a month old.

Npc_Villager
Player
<cf>It went that unsold goods from the previous stall were just piled up and left there as is.

Sheep raised in such places have fluffy wool, and the wool sweater is of very high quality.

How about getting one for winter? <cf>I highly recommend it.

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Customer, how about some dishes from Montegnor?

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
If you're an adventurer, I'm going to be adventurous. <cf>They last a long time, so they're the perfect travel companion.

Phew. I'm so excited...

Npc_Peddler

Npc_Peddler
Player
The road to Salamzahd that I am on is a busy place.

Npc_Peddler
Player
It's a commercially important place, and there are many peddlers who commute from Asterlies. I don't like it.

This May Day is like the end of the world, but it's a very important checkpoint.
Npc_Gatekeeper

I am proud of this job
Npc_Gatekeeper

Up Ahead Lies A Holy Place called the “Silent City.” <cf>We are the cult guards who guard it.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
But there was a small restaurant. <cf>The Holy Land is now in danger.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
We Have Been Forced to Come Here and Are Forced Working on Forced.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard

Just now, someone run off alone the silent city...
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard

The Scissors Over There Is A Bit Bad Right Now.

I hope nothing matters...

That monster... <cf>We can't handle it clothes

I GUESS THERE'S NO CHOICE BUT TO EXPERIENCE THAT PLACE...

A Monster Escaped in the Silent City, and I Been Escaped with My Life...
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Oh, I didn't run away... <cf>I just wanted to be the proud order. Yes
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Now that I think about it, I passed an adventurer on the way... <cf>Could he have been heading to the Silent City?
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
The Turmoil in Avaritia has been resolved thanks to you. <cf>Thank you
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
However, the dangerous may become dangerous again at any time, so we will continue to be on alert.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
But the “Silent City” is a strange place.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
It used to be a city called “Andorra” <cf>It was destroyed in the war and destroyed a ruin...
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
A while ago, there was a big trouble underground, and since then, it has been under the control of the cult.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
The cause is not well injured.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Or maybe they know but can't make it public...
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Oops, that's it for now
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
You guys say that thing?!
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
It's amazing relaxing shampoo!
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
But if an Adventurer argues us, <cf>our reputation will be ruined.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS ARE GOING TO GET TOUGHER FROM NOW ON...
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Behind this is the “Silent City”
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Orders have been waiting to continue on guard duty.
8
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
I was relieved that the young man felt relieved.
8
Npc_Tyris
Player
But even so, why was he there... <cf>Did he know that the other person was Avaritia?
8
Npc_Tyris
Player
In any case, that young man. <cf>He had a special vibe.
8
Npc_Tyris

Next is the desert...

well, that's right. You can<cf>'t prepare a guarantor of your identity right away
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
Checkpoint checks used to be lax
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
<cf>I wonder if it doesn't have to be that tingling just because Mr. Dunkirk is here
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
He's the strongest captain of the Knights in the human race, isn't he? No matter what happens, Mr. Dunkirk will <cf>do something about it
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
whoa whoa... Will the <cf>Bureau of Reclamation accept me as an identity guarantor or something?
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
The Principality of Barnhardt is also kind of difficult
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
Dragons are attacked, and the duke is overthrown. It seems that Mr. Dunkirk is actually in <cf>charge
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
Even though he's the strongest knight, he doesn't specialize in politics. <cf>Is there anyone to help?
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
Hey, listen up! I made eye contact with the shrine maiden!
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
huh? Don't you know? A <cf>group of pilgrims passed through here and into the desert
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
But the shrine maiden is surprisingly young. <cf>I was so surprised!
?
Npc_Traveller
Player
Oh, they're still kids, aren't they? <cf>And yet, being made to walk all over the place is tough, isn't it

Npc_Traveller

<cf>If you want to go through the checkpoint, you have a certificate from your guarantor and adventurer rank 6

Are you guys going to Salamzart?

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That place is good. <cf>It has a unique atmosphere, so much so that I travel every year
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's a city built as an oasis in the desert. <cf>the comfort of the waterside is amazing, isn't it
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Only people who have traveled to the desert can understand that goodness. I definitely want to <cf>talk with you about the appeal of Salamzart

Npc_Atl_Citizen

how is that? What is the condition

Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
<cf>I went all the way to become a guarantor, so I'm not going to waste it, is it?
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
They said they went to Salamzart?
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
<cf>Unlike Asterlies, there must have been a lot of rare things over there

Npc_Coin_Owner

Here, it's a souvenir. Take it

Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
oh? <cf>There's also such a thing as you bring souvenirs

Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
If you don't like it, I'll get it back

Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
No idiot, it's a souvenir from Transcendental Beautiful Girl. <cf>If you don't receive it, you'll get hit by a bee

Hey, don't say that in a creepy way!

Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
ha ha ha! <cf>It's probably what you always say

Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
<cf>Here's a little advice as a thank you for the Salamzart souvenir
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
<cf>There are many dangerous places in the Evergreen Desert, so be careful
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
There are also cases where the Bureau of Reclamation is making a strong warning. If you don<cf>'t have enough ability, don't you approach them carelessly, right?

Npc_Coin_Owner

ah! Thank you guys for that time

Have you seen [Kosaifu (Kosaifu)]?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
that must have been an amazing monster. Salamzart is the only one that can <cf>see that clearly
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I think eagles are the most beautiful in the world. <cf>[Kosaifu (Kosaifu)] is the specialty of Salamzat, isn't it
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
hey, adventurer. Haven't you received requests to find lost children? <cf>I mean, that too...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I saw an unfamiliar kid playing with our [slurp]. <cf>Maybe it's a traveler or a pilgrimage
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
She was dressed like a shrine maiden, and her hair was pale green. A girl who feels so detached from <cf>Ukiyo-e
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That's because good people and bad people gather at the oasis. <cf>I'm a little worried
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
<cf>I feel like I just saw the shrine maiden from the Oracle...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
<cf>I'm sure they feel open when they come to Salamzart
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
<cf>Pilgrimage seems to be tough, and it's fine to take a break once in a while
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Mr. Einlein must be somewhere in this town
?
Npc_Elektra
Player
If you take your eyes off it, you'll go somewhere right away. <cf>we are struggling too
?
Npc_Elektra
Player
<cf>If it were the head of the temple, I think they should stay quiet and stay still
?
Npc_Elektra
Player
<cf>So, I'm sorry, but please look for Mr. Einlein
?
Npc_Elektra
Player
As expected, it's the Knights Barnhardt. It <cf>was polite and nice
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Especially Captain Dunkirk! it<cf>'s so dignified that it makes me yearn for it
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Very different from my husband. <cf>I wouldn't let go if I were a little younger
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Is that the rumored Captain Dunkirk
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's so amazing that they act on behalf of the duke. It's <cf>an official representative of the country's mission
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Take proper care of Salamzat too. <cf>I'm so moved that you went out of your way to come
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
What do the Knights of the Duchy of Barnhardt want in the desert?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
No, I know you came as an envoy. <cf>They're going in and out of ruins all over the place

Npc_Adventurer
Player
<cf>I don't know the purpose, but I don't think it's just a courtesy visit
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
what? Did you meet Dunkirk? <cf>where is that?
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
Oh, <cf>oh... I wonder if that was definitely “[Mushi Fort (Musutori)]” by “[Akatsuki (Akatsuki)]”
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
<cf>Oh, thanks to him, I saved my life, well, my servant

Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
What was Dunkirk doing there?
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
There's no way we would know about that
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
However, they were saying how the investigation was going...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
investigation...?
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
what is that? Lord, are you going to eat it awfully?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
ah, no... The world is in turmoil lately, isn't it? <cf>I'm a little worried too
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
<cf>In addition to the Salamzart talks, the Knight Commander directly investigates at Fort Bug... or
?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
<cf>I also feel like it's not related to the attack on the Principality in question, but it was busy

J
Npc_Audience
Player
Damn, this is bad! <cf>I should be more relaxed like a normal person!
J
Npc_Audience
Player
Hmm. There were some people who did hate things like attacking this oasis.
J
Npc_Audience
Player
Attacking attacks and oases is a victim of the desert people's laws. <cf>Even Bandits Don't Do That.
J
Npc_Audience
Player
An Insider Who Doesn't Care About the Rules... <cf>He didn't kill someone or do something even kill.
J

What on Earth will bring to the depths of the singer? <cf>Scary, it's scary to even Imaginee it.
J
Npc_Audience
Player
Hey, adventurer. I don't have status, money, or power, but I'd like to ask you for a favor.
J
Npc_Audience
Player
Can you help her out? If things continue like this, not only she but everyone with a conscience in the desert will be happy.
J
Npc_Audience
Player
That's... The Face That Tied to Know Where the Outlaw Who Was Chasing the Girl Went!
J
Npc_Adventurer

They ran out of the oasis. <cf>Sip and chase them!
J
Npc_Adventurer

The terrified face of that girl... <cf>Don't leave her alone!
J
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Oh come on! If you didn't ask me to wait here, I would go!
J
Npc_Adventurer
Player
What's going on? Some scary looking guys ran outside chasing a girl.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Maybe it's some clan festival? <cf>It might be something like a grand wedding celebration.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
... Huh!? Attack!? <cf>No, that would be bad!
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Charlotte has married to the south, married by them! <cf>Please, help me...

What motivation?! <cf>Who the hell are those guys...?
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader

No, more relaxation, it's Shar. <cf>That girl was the target...!
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
Oh! Adventurer! <cf>PLEASE HELP MY SHAR!
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
Troubles are always risky, but <cf>this is the first time we've got anything like it...
J
Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
The young guys are lying behind, but that<cf>'s enough to worry about me...
J
Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
Adventurer, can you end me your strength? <cf>Please help Charlotte.
J
Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
She is like our daughter.
J
Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
Oh dear. It's going to be there will be no additional relaxation. <cf>I was relieved to hear that the diva was saved.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Well, it can't be difficult, since they're a troupe of performers. <cf>Maybe they can't postpone the performance in the next town or something.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Maybe next year will be the next performance in Salamzahd? <cf>She has a wonderful singing voice, so I'm looking forward to it.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
She will be even better next year. <cf>That's why...
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's a bit displeased that I wasn't able to hear this year's special voice and song until the end.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Charlotte-chan... <cf>She's my favorite, my absolute favorite!
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Walking back and forth through the Barren Desert. I, a humble peddler, saw an angel.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Charlotte-chan is the bride of life. <cf>An oasis beach before a dying traveler!
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I will cheer you on with all my might at the next performance. <cf>Why don't you join us?
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
After Seeing A Performer On Stage, I Feel Like I've Had A Vivid Dream.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
EVEN THE UNCHANGING EVERYDAY LIFE COOKING FRESH. <cf>I like that too, just like the stage.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That's why I come here to see you Tidy Up. <cf>I want to enjoy the afterglow.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
This dream got a little rough in the middle. <cf>I HOPE I CAN WATCH IT MORE INTENDED NEXT TIME.
J
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
We are on alert because there may be some of those guys out there.
J
Npc_Troupe_Member
Player
If Charlotte and Her Friends Are Unbearable Again, <cf>It Will Be Unbearable.
J
Npc_Troupe_Member
Player
This time, I have to protect her breasts...
J
Npc_Troupe_Member
Player
Oh yeah, have you heard? <cf>Dunkirk is coming to Asterliese
J
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
I was just passing by on my trip. <cf>If I were to come along, it would be a big deal.
J
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
I Came to Eat at the “Mawaru Kanri-tei”. <cf>The BEAUTIFUL VICE-COMMANDER was with me.
J
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
Damn, why is it called the Carrying Wheel Pavilion, that bastard? <cf>Why not be smart and call it the Coin Pavilion?
J
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
But even if you had come to my house, <cf>it would have had trouble a lot of trouble...
J
Npc_Coin_Owner
Player
Thank you so much for happy Charlotte.
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
She's a very responsible girl, so I hope she doesn't jump to death because of this incident...
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
Hey everyone. <cf>Thank you for saying thank you Shar
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
She left the trouble for a while. <cf>I guess that's after what happened...
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
If I had been more sensitive, <cf>I couldn't have felt the child.
J
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
I heard that Shar was worried about us and Hid was sick
J
Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
You're a stupid kid. You don't need to worry about it. <cf>We're like family.
J
Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
Slightly... <cf>Maybe I should make her some of her favorite foods so she'll want to come home soon!

I once asked her if she was looking for someone, and she laughed sadly, shook her head, and said
+
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
["I can't stop looking for someone who isn't there” ["]. <cf>What does that mean?
+
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That person may be left alone now, but it seems like he had a hard time when he was young.
+
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I heard that he was caught doing some crazy research at the “Mihashira” of “Kamigakari” and was driven here.
+
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
what? Who did you say it? <cf>It's the old man who comes every day.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even so, it's amazing that it even seems in a desert like this...

I'm ashamed to say that I'm not very good at that sort of thing. <cf>Ugh... I can't even Imaginee it.

Npc_Joerg

Delicate I try not to let go of the balm I use to repeat shampoo... No, that thing.

Flowers are precious in the desert. <cf>I guess I won't be able to get any new ones.

Npc_Joerg

What do you think? <cf>Are you excited to find the “Flower of the Sand Wind”?

I can't express my feelings to you for selfishness up with the selfishness of an old man like me...

But you are really good people. <cf>Just Meeting You Has Made It Worth Living Until Today.

The Place Electra was talking about... <cf>“Borum Ruins”, I think.

If things continue like this, we won't be able to continue the pilgrimage, and <cf>everyone is feeling tired...

<cf>The [Kosaifu (kosaifu)] was blowing until a while ago, but apparently it has subsided

Npc_Atl_Citizen

[Kousaifu (kosaifu)] is a wind that blows into the desert, isn't it? It's <cf>sparkling and so beautiful

Npc_Atl_Citizen

However, sand also flies with it, and visibility deteriorates

Player
what? <cf>In the desert, noisy people targeted the girl's life?
+
Npc_Jake
Player
<cf>There are thieves and thieves everywhere, but I'm worried that they attacked the stage of a traveling entertainer

Npc_Jake

They should basically avoid being conspicuous like that

Npc_Jake
Player
Has even some stupid organization started moving forward? <cf>information, thanks. I'll look it up here too

Npc_Jake

Hey, this is interesting information. Sightings of dragons are increasing in the <cf>Evergreen Desert

Npc_Jake

she was just at Salamzart's side, wasn't she? <cf>Let me know if you notice anything

Npc_Jake

There are also people who attacked divas. <cf>I don't see any connection between it and the dragons, but...

Npc_Jake

Anyway, be careful. <cf>I don't know where what's lurking

Npc_Jake

huh!? The shrine maidens of the <cf>Bavarian Order were dragons!?

What's more, they said they ran into Voldigen again... <cf>Hey hey, isn't there something amazing going on?

Even so, I'm glad you're safe. It was <cf>Hard Luck, but the one that survived was Good Luck!

PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING TO MAKE A KILLING IN BUSINESS ARE OPENING Various Stores.

Today I came to buy some fabrics.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Look, the colorful variety that adorn the city. <cf>Aren't they beautiful?

Npc_Atl_Citizen

I try it out with different colors according to the season. <cf>This kind of thing is pretty fun.

Npc_Atl_Citizen

So, what color should I choose next?

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I wonder if they sell goats anywhere

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's My Son's 10th birthday. <cf>I want to give him a big celebration.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
... Oh, even though we celebrate with a goat, we don't eat it.

Npc_Atl_Citizen

When they reach the age of ten, they are given a goat to look after. <cf>That is the tradition of the nomads.

Salamzahd is a city formed by the dead people of the desert and people who came from outside.

Npc_Adventurer
Player
There are various conflicts. <cf>The Bureau of Reclamation and the Bafaria Church have been tried to overcome.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Customs and customs are quite problematic issues.

Npc_Adventurer

It depends on the circumstances in Barnhardt, and it's a sleeping place city.

Npc_Adventurer

Adventurers, you come from across the desert, right?

npc_boy_common
Player
That's nice. That's amazing. <cf>I wonder what's on the other side of the desert?

I'd like to go someday too
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Have you seen the ruins in that endless desert?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I don't know when it was, but there was once a thriving town there.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
According to the Legends of Salamzahd, it was a very beautiful city.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I wish I could have seen it with my own eyes just once.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
How about some fresh fruit?

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Full of juice. <cf>This is the best way to quench your thirst.

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
You might think there's no fruit in the desert, but you can pick them here.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
All of this is thanks to the oasis. <cf>I'm excited for that.

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
How about some exotic items? <cf>We also have clothes, jewelry, and perfume. Take a look!

Npc_Shopkeeper

Not comfortable? Don't say that. <cf>You Might Meet Your Destiny.

Hey, are you an adventurer? <cf>You're not from Salamzahd, are you?

In Salamzahd, it rains only shampoo and very little.

But isn't that the case in other places? <cf>I'd like to go there too.

Whew, we're selling pretty well today. <cf>After all, location is also important in business.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
This town has many restaurants and is a good place for business, but <cf>not everything in the town is good.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
The number of customers depends on where you set up your store. <cf>You get it, right?
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
That's why street clothes like us have a hard time relaxation for space.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Have you been in this town yet?
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I do business in many places, but <cf>I like the food here the best.

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
The Meat of Nomadic Lamb Sprinkled with Plenty of Spices <cf>and Dishes is simply delicious!

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I'm eating it with thin cornbread.

Strong warriors are fighting in this town. <cf>There are a lot of monsters outside the town.

This is the Bafaria Temple.

Npc_Priest
Player
Salamzahd has its own manners in worshiping prayers. <cf>However, The Bafarian with the Most Followers is the Bafarian teenager.
?
Npc_Priest
Player
We Priests also try our best to pray for the believers who visit us.
?
Npc_Priest
Player
However, there aren't many Priests... <cf>It's far from the Holy Land, after all...
?
Npc_Priest

Oh, sorry. It's nothing, so don't worry about it!

I go to this Baphalia temple to pray every day.

If You Pray Every Day, The God of the Sky Will Hear You

But someday I would like to visit a large shrine or even the “Kamigakari no mihashira” (Pillar of the Gods).
?
Npc_Believer
Player
It must be a truly divine place...
?
Npc_Believer
Player
I've heard some scary stories about dragons being seen more often.

Npc_Adventurer
Player
It would be one thing if it were asterlies or Barnhardt, but if this city were to be destroyed, it would be a disaster.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Brrr... I hope no dragons come near
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
This is a pretty busy town. <cf>Outside the town is the desert and it's all sand...

Npc_Adventurer
Player
There are many things in the city. <cf>Is this shampoo different from other clothes, isn't it?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
There's Plenty of Food for Adventurers! <cf>Don't forget to stop by the Reclamation Bureau.

Npc_Adventurer

Hello. Are you an adventurer? <cf>Is this your first time in Salamzahd?

Salamzahd is a city surrounded by an oasis on the edge of the Evergreen Desert.

It's the Midpoint of the Trade Route between Asterlies and the Duchy of Barnhardt.

Npc_Vendor

Which wish should I write...?
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
Are you a sleeping adventurer? <cf>Have you been to the waterfall yet?

Npc_Atl_Citizen

You can splash around the waterfall and it's the coolest place in town.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It really feels like an oasis!
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
But it's a place that everyone uses. <cf>It's taboo to bathe in it shampoo.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Are you a sleeping adventurer? <cf>Let me teach you the ways of Salamzahd.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Don't even think about stealing in this town
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
You think it's the same in other clothes? Maybe, but it's especially bad in this town.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
If you get caught stealing, you'll be beaten up by the townsfolk on the spot. Remember that.

Npc_Shopkeeper

Are you a traveler? This city is busy. <cf>Look at those balloons.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Balloon Floating Around the City <cf>Have Been Attached to Them

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
When you have a wish, write it on a stone and put it in a balloon along with your offering.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
And when your wish comes true, you are leaving to cut the balloon string.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even now, I deal in a variety of products, but <cf>my dream is to deal in the finest jewels.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Salamzahd is famous for its fine jewellery craftswomen, so <cf>he saved up money and crafts the best craftsmen.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
I want to open a big jewelry store. <cf>The main product will be necklaces with big gemstones.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Well, I haven't got the gold yet, I haven't got the tinkerer yet, and I haven't found the big jewel yet.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Adventurer, how about this fabric? <cf>If you want clothes, I can make them for you.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
This is a specialty of Salamzahd, crystallized silk fabric. <cf>What do you think? It's beautiful, isn't it? It feels good on the skin too.
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
And the use of color! <cf>Isn't this a beauty you can't see anywhere else?
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Are you looking around? Too bad. <cf>Our fabrics are the best!
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Adventurer? <cf>The Sunlight in this city must be pretty beautiful.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
And what's more, it's so hot! I'm getting used to it, but it gets really cold at night.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Drowning in the Shade Before You Feel Relaxed Med is also a part of the Salamzahd Way of Shade time.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Phew, the water shampoo is good. <cf>Phew, I can finally rest.

Npc_Atl_Citizen

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
W-Wow! <cf>Are you an adventurer?
?
npc_boy_common
Player
You know, I've never been outside the city, so I don't know what it's like outside.
?
npc_boy_common
Player
So, there's something I've been asking about, <cf>I want to ask you...
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Is it true that outside the city there are swarms of gourds over mountains?
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Oh no! Is that a lie?! <cf>Dad Fool Me Again...
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Oh, you've come to play again. Good riddance
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
There are lots of hunters around here. <cf>Get to safety before you get caught.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Looking Closer, I see he's not a horned goat but an adventurer. <cf>I've been making that feeling a lot of trouble. Please don't take it the long way.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Guido is a strange guy. <cf>I heard he's a detective...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Every time we meet, he asks me, “Is something going on?”
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
No worries, no worries yet. <cf>I wonder if there are no jobs.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Expectations, Don't Detectives Only Show Up After A Crime Has Detected?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
There is an old lady in Salamzahd that goes, “Tomorrow has its own song”
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even if today is no good, there is another chance tomorrow. <cf>Expectations are not infinite, but they come every day.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's A Thing That Today's Failure Feeling You So Much That You Can't Sing Tomorrow's Song.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Tomorrow is tomorrow, today is today, tomorrow is tomorrow. <cf>Make sure you love each new day.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
You feel like you think my tent has a plain pattern. <cf>It used to be much more flashy.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It had my face empathy all over it. <cf>Just Imagineing It Makes Your Heart Tremble, Doesn't It?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
But we've been getting tired from all over the place that kids cry when they see the tents...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
So now it's a safe pattern. <cf>I GUESS MY SEX APPEAL WAS TOO MUCH FOR A CHILD. Hahaha
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Welcome! <cf>This is the Imaginee Laboratory.
?
Npc_Lab_Staff
Player
Don't underestimate this desert research facility! <cf>ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT IS OCCASION!
?
Npc_Lab_Staff
Player
... Well, every city is new.
?
Npc_Lab_Staff
Player
Hello It's a good day for crafting today too.
?
Npc_Craftsman
Player
This is the Artisan Square of Salamzahd. <cf>Feel free to use the training rituals.
?
Npc_Craftsman
Player
The Evergreen Desert is a desert, so the monsters have a unique ecology.
?
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Get rare materials and <cf>craft new clothes!
?
Npc_Craftsman
Player
This is my first time in Salamzahd, and <cf>it's a really nice town!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The food is delicious! The people are tired! <cf>The weather is clear and crisp!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
It's like this town was made for me! <cf>I've tried to make this my base of operations!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I'm hungry because I've been concentrating on crafting. <cf>I think it's about time to eat something.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Since I've come all the way to Salamzahd, I'd like to try the local cuisine.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I'm sure Salamzahd was famous for its meat dishes. <cf>Meat after crafting! Yes, that might not be bad!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I went to “Akatsuki no Mushitori de” (Akatsuki no Mushitori de) <cf>but no matter how many times I see it, it's still a creepy place.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
“Akatsuki's Dairy Fort” is a giant sleeping nest in the east. <cf>It's slaughter with insect-like monsters.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Unless you're a real bug lover, I don't think this is a very dangerous dungeon.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Do you know the “Boruom Ruins”?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I can't find the Bafaria Relic either. <cf>It's just a nondescript ruin.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The wind that blows through the ruins has a mysterious power, and miraculous treasures are bones.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
But it feels to be a very rare disaster, so <cf>destroyed the ruins in search of treasure is a waste of effort.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I've been going there for about five years now, but the results are... <cf>What the heck! Is it long to seek romance?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I was saved by bandits and was saved by a hunter. <cf>Are The Hunters in This Town Strong.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Maybe I should quit being an adventurer and become a hunter too.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Hey brother! How are you? <cf>This is the Salamzahd Reclamation Bureau.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The appearance is quite different from the buildings in other interiors, right? <cf>Many Adventurers Don't Even Realize It's The Reclamation Bureau.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
That's why I'm here to guide those people.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
If you want to get a job, come in... <cf>I don't think I need to explain that much. Good luck, brother!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The Children ran the Reclamation Bureau, so I was crying, thinking they were going to read a book...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
He just slipped behind the tent. <cf>Oh dear.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's sleeping a secret playground for the bad boys.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Well, the Most Important Thing for a Desert Child is to be Lively. <cf>Naughty brats and pranks are fine! ha ha ha!
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
In this city, we hate the rumblebois. <cf>Because in the desert, the rumblebois dig in the sand.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's a way to find shallow water baths. <cf>They can't live without water either.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Maybe because he has a good nose, <cf>he's good at finding water shampoo.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
So, the rumbleboa is a beast that irritating water. <cf>If you hunt it, you can get its fur and meat. It's a good deal.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Going East through the Evergreen Desert, you can see a cliff. <cf>In the Center of the Cliff is a place called “The Hermit's Spring.”
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
“A Hermit Lives in the Hermit's Spring...” <cf>It is said, but the truth is unknown.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's a place that even locals go near. <cf>Some people go there crazy, but the reason is...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That's right, it's a lovers' rendezvous.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
This city is too open. <cf>It's hard to find places like that.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even though I look like this, I used to be popular
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
When I was an active hunter, Just Killing A Sand Viper would elicit a shriek from the crowd.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Warriors and Hunters are especially brave in this town. <cf>Adventurers are now also fighting as fighters.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Me now? <cf>... I married that I didn't get married then.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Sand Viper is a monster with nothing to throw away. <cf>If you remove the poison, you can eat it, and the poison can also be used.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Moreover, the poison can be denatured by soaking it in healing herbs. <cf>The Denatured Poison is also used as a tonic and is delicious.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
The leather is also durable to durable, durable and hard. <cf>It is used for belts and boots!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
It is said to be a blessing from the desert. <cf>Of course, be poisonous of poison when hunting.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Light flower, sand wind flower, moon flower... <cf>All of these BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS ARE SAID TO BE FOUND IN THE DESERT.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The desert is a relaxing environment for relaxation. <cf>If you let your guard down even a little, your life will be taken.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
So, I want the flowers to be at least strong and beautiful enough to leave the desert.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That feeling makes beautiful flowers bloom in the desert. <cf>... just kidding
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Hmm, what a nice color. I dyed this fabric myself. <cf>It's getting more and more textured by exposure to the sun.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
What do you think, Adventurer? The Reclamation Bureaus in Other Thoughts Don't Have Tents as Thoughts as This One.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
what? It's not a tent in the first place? <cf>Is it a building made of stone or wood? Whaaaat?!
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Is it okay to indulge in such luxury? <cf>People from other regions are strange!
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even though it's so hot, Nappo is doing well.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
There are some in Salamzahd too. <cf>They come out everywhere.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Feeling Dizzy I Get So Dry I Feel Dizzy
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Just throw it in the oasis and it'll be back to normal. <cf>That's a good thing, man.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
look! E-chan's shampoo toy. <cf>Isn't it cute?
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
My dad threw it for me at Asterlies. <cf>It's my treasure.
?
Npc_girl_common
Player
The Oracle Priestess is the most important person in the Bafaria ceremony.
?
Npc_girl_common
npc_boy_common
Only the Shrine Maiden can hear the voice of the god. It's relaxing.
?
Npc_girl_common
npc_boy_common
Is I wonder if the God of Bafaria is good at singing too? <cf>If the Shrine Maiden Hears It, Will She Tell Me?

I never thought it would turn out like this...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
What are you talking about, Barnhardt? <cf>The Duke was assassinated...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
But I'm sure that the Knight Commander, Lord Dunkirk, will be able to do something about it.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Did you know? Rumor has it that the Murderer of the Duke has appeared here.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
If you catch him, you'll get a big bounty.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That's the kind of thing you can enjoy and live with until your grandchildren's generation.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Wow, if that's true, that's true.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It's Rumored That Assassin of King Barnhardt was a member of the Knights.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I'm sure even Dunkirk-sama can't handle it...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Duke has restaurants, so <cf>there must be a state neighborhood.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
What time of year does it open
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even though I look like this, I have a strange connection to the Duchy of Barnhardt.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
That's why I thought it would be better to be better than the state thought. <cf>Ohohoho...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Assassin is Intrigued Outta in the Asteria region.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It would be awful if they wanted that I was dying someone. <cf>If this were they to lead to a war...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I still can't believe that the Great Duke Norbert is No Longer with Us...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
But I have to accept it...

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Assault for a while, Commander Dunkirk will be at the helm of my enemies.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Don't worry, I hear he's a smart guy with a good family background <cf>I'm sure he'll do a good job.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Wow, the cargo numbers don't match after all!
?
Npc_Worker
Player
Oh no! It's related to the Barnhardt Knights, so if the numbers are different it will be a pretty big problem.
?
Npc_Worker
Player
Recently, there has been a lot of Bafaria legalistic sent to the Duchy of Barnhardt.
?
Npc_Worker
Player
It also depends on the weight of the cargo, so we have to adjust it depends. <cf>Oh, what a joke!
?
Npc_Worker
Player
I never thought that Duchy of Barnhardt would end up like this...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
It used to be a good country... <cf>I'm a sailor, so I've been there many times.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The musicians from Barnhardt were all of high quality and <cf>everyone was tired...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Even at my age, I've got around the world on my own two feet and have a good eye for quality...
?
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Let's not go to Barnhardt for a while. <cr><cf>Until The Beginning Calms Down

Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
It's a nice day today, but... <cf>I can't help but feel uncomfortable.

Npc_Atl_Citizen

There Has Been A Lot of Scary Scary Scary Recently...

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Ha... taaaah...!! <cf>Kah... gwaaaah... haa, haa
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Hmm? ... Don't talk to me for a second. Ha, ha, <cf>I'm going to catch the assassin, ha, I'm doing image training.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
What's with that face? I know you're worried, but don't worry. <cf>We Adventurers will protect this town!
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
My dad is out buying supplies, so I'm looking after the store instead.
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Eh? supplier? <cf>It's Barnhardt...
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Don't worry. Dad will be back soon.
?
npc_boy_common
Player
What the hell? <cf>There's Been A Lot of Cancellations Rejected.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
If it were just the dragons it would be one thing, but <cf>Barnhardt was lying in that fuss too, right?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Thanks to you, we don't make any business. <cf>The sailors' lodges are deserted.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Oh no, no no. <cf>Can someone do something about this?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
... It feels like that Duke Barnhardt has been busy.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
The world committed that it was a family member who committed the crime, but <cf>yes, that's right. We know that.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
There's No Longer About It. “They” have moved on...!
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen
We are the only ones who knows the truth... <cf>You know what to do... right?

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Npc_Atl_Citizen

Whiteish, Strange Clothes, Light Purple Hair... <cf>Early teens...

Npc_Adventurer
Player
Oh, come to think of it, I've heard that people like that often appear in the arena.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Mr. Dunkirk... Was he really that scary?
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
I saw you in the city, but <cf>you didn't look like someone I could talk to...
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Whole Person was exuding “Stay Away”. <cf>She used to be a friendly and kind person.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
Wow, I'm suffocated.
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Barnhardt Knights came here until recently. <cf>It was so tense that I couldn't get close.

I know the country is in trouble. <cf>I hope they don't drag us into it too.

Npc_Villager

It felt like there was some kind of meeting between some important people.

Npc_Villager

I heard it wasn't a very good atmosphere.

Npc_Villager

You, Mr. Dunkirk, have done some boring things.

Npc_Villager
Player
Everyone prays to the Mihashira every day.

Npc_Villager
Player
Asterlies was a bit noisy

Npc_Villager

The rumor is that an assassin or something has taken refuge there.

Npc_Villager

That's all I've been doing what I've been trying to do. <cf>I wish I could just take my time and grow snacks.

Do you know the Kingdom of Drava?

Npc_Atl_Citizen

It's a country that feels before the Duchy of Barnhardt. <cf>The Duchy has a research institute that dates back to that time.

Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
“Drava Royal Research Institute”. <cf>It's an old facility that's still in use today.

In the Barnhardt Parish of the Bafaria Church, there is a facility called the “Drava Royal Research Institute”.

It is a place to research the heritage and technology of Bafaria, and <cf>it also cognition with the Duchy of Barnhardt.

Well, since I was tired with this job, I had to do it well. <cf>Welcome to the “Double-sided Coin Pavilion”

Npc_Jake

Should I eat something? Or drink something?

Npc_Jake

Please take your time and relax. <cf>This is an oasis for adventurers.

Npc_Jake

Since I'm in charge of the coin restaurant, I can't do anything careless.

Npc_Jake

In the name of the top of the best, <cf>there's no room for relaxation even a single runo!

Npc_Jake
Player
The “Temple of Heavenly Blessing” is a sacred place that only a limited number of people, including the Priestess of the Oracle, can enter.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
But you are special. <cf>You have been asked by the Oracle to give your power to God.

Npc_Ryugerio
Player
For us believers, the oracles are absolute.

Npc_Ryugerio

The Oracle Priestess who spoke and conveys it is a symbol of the Bafaria sweater.

God watches over us. <cf>The Oracle Priestess will tell you this.

The Shrine Maiden says it's God's will, but <cf>is it really okay to dismiss it with such words...?

Npc_Priest
Player
I Heard That Right After the Angel Went, A Heard from Barnhardt Came.
?
Npc_Priest
Player
I Haven't Heard Many Good Things About That Country Recently. I think something fishy is going on.

Npc_Priest

Oops, just between you and me. <cf>I don't want to end up like Mr. Walkin

In this situation, we must once again find a way to save Tiris and the future.

Npc_Einrain

If you should know, God will tell you... <cf>If not, there's no need to know.

Npc_Einrain
Player
Tch...! <cf>The Guards' eyes are shining here too. Damn it!

Huh? WH-what are you?! <cf>I haven't done anything yet!

The Sea is Shallow Around here. <cf>Large ships can't anchor here.

Npc_Villager
Player
They said that a long time ago, this area was another country. <cf>It was called the Kingdom of Drava.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
THE SONGS AND DANCES THAT TAKE PLACE IN VILLAGE MASTERS ARE RESTIMONS OF THE CULTURE OF THE DRAVA KINGDOM.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Most of the men in this village became fishermen. <cf>It's the most stable way to make a living room.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
While the Fishermen are at sea, the women do the work on land. <cf>They make dried fish, make dibon, and prepare for the festival.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
THE YOUNG PEOPLE TOGETHER KNIGHTS AND CASTLE SOLDIERS... <cf>One day they will walk how this village works.

Player
The Twin Kings bring misfortune... <cf>It's the Legend of Barnhardt.

Npc_Villager
Player
The Five Dukes were twins, but he was married by his younger brother. <cf>He is famous as the last king of the “Heartless King.”
?
Npc_Villager
Player
During the Asterlies War of Thoughts, his twin brother was king. <cf>There are a few other teenagers like that.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
To put it simply, it's bad luck. <cf>That kind of thing bothers me, doesn't it?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Our Barnhardt Army, which Prides on its Military Strength, places Great Prides on Armed Forces Training.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
That's why clothes wear clothes out clothes and <cf>have to be clothes often.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It's good to have a strong military suit
?
Npc_Villager
Player
But the amount of relaxation that is occupied is also large... <cf>There was once an incident where a bandit group armed forces with attacked civilians.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Boats are important because they are the lifeblood of us fishermen. <cf>We take great care of them.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
We've been living room on this boat for ages. <cf>The people in the town must be eaten for our fish!

Player
A beginner knight is teaching. <cf>I'm sure you'll hear some great stories.
?
npc_boy_common
Player
I heard you can also get a “Shiken ni Suinen”, but <cf>what is “Shiken”? Is it the name of a sword?
?
npc_boy_common
Player
Look at this comfy dyed fabric made using Barnhardt's traditional clothes.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Asterlize and Salamzahd do not have a color that is too bold.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Don't you think it feels like you a sense of the feeling history of this land?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
'Kanaroan'... <cf>In the past, it was only drunk in this village...
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It's now a popular drink called Devon. <cf>Even the locals can drink get a drink there snacks.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It was popular with teenagers and started to sell well, but... <cf>It's not suitable for mass production.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Missed I missed the days when we had an all-you-can-drink
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Outside the Village, Those Who Lived Fighting the Dragon Tribe Are Buried. <cf>IT'S A GRAVEYARD PRESIDENT THE TOGETHER OF A PAST WAR.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
For years, the people of this land have been fighting the dragon tribe. <cf>The Ferocity of the Battle can be felt even from the ancient battlefield outside.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
NOW THAT KNIGHTS HAVE COME TO THE VILLAGE, IT'S TOGETHER. <cf>I must be present to the people of the castle...
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Barnhardt is the largest nation on the musicians of Magna. <cf>It feels, it's used, it's used to be even harmful.

The Three Sovereign Kings, known as the “Kings of Invasion”<cf>, most of the Magna gods.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
... Barnhardt is so big, <cf>there's no way he'd notice if I was the only one slacking off here!
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Oh no, another fish delivery! <cf>I'm an adventurer...
?
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Villager
Well, it's safer than fighting, so I end up fighting it.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Villager
But I'm getting a board of just making deliveries. <cf>I'm not a delivery guy...
?
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Villager
Yes! Ruins and Battlefields are popular recreational spots.
?
Npc_Fisherman
Player
If I had to eat something to eat, it would be fish. <cf>Fresh fish is landed every day.

Npc_Fisherman
Player
It's a nice village so please enjoy it

Npc_Fisherman
Player
I truly believe that peace is the best thing.

Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Adventurer
Then I found Ruins I'd never seen before!

Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Adventurer
[--] And, this feeling of relaxation is still mine alone... <cf>Would you like to go with me next time?
?
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Adventurer
Hey, if we keep quiet the cult will make a fuss. <cf>You'd be better off up and report this to the Reclamation Bureau before they find out.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Adventurer
I'm sure there was someone who didn't report the relic because they wanted to monopolize it.

Npc_Jake
Player
I'm glad the Star Spirit Festival ended relaxation. <cf>Ryugerio was a little angry, but...
?
Npc_Einrain
Player
Charlotte and the others sang a flashy song on stage... <cf>Is that true?
?
Npc_Einrain
Player
It's a place to give thanks to God, so I don't think that's a good thing to do... but...
?
Npc_Einrain
Player
... I just wanted to listen to it
?
Npc_Einrain
Player
Well, the Star Spirit Festival is as you would expect. <cf>It's lively and great.

Npc_Hugo
Player
If I didn't have work, I would be a beautiful woman and giving myself over to a moment of relaxation.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
Our Soldiers are excellent, and we also have the Cult's Guards. <cf>I think it will be fine if we leave it to the field.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
After All, There Are Self-Tired Adventurers Like You Guys Out There, Right?
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
Well, I'll enjoy myself while I'm inspecting. <cf>I'll also watch The Stage Performance of the Star Spirit Diva.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
With the Thoughts of Miss Charlotte, this year's stage is sure to be one to watch.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
I'm looking forward to it. Ah, I can't wait.

Npc_Hugo
Player
Oh, my, my. <cf>Did you all come to see the Star Spirit Festival?
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
I am also a priest. <cf>I have to show up at least for the Star Spirit Festival.
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
Well, I wasn't really called that way.
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
But to think that she was really excited as the Celestial Spirit Diva...
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
It is true that a singer does not have to be a priestess. <cf>There Are Records That She Was Involved by the Citizens.
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
But that... <cf>The singing presents to be quite good,
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
No, I didn't come here to check on you! <cf>I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE DESPERTING YOUR RESEARCH...
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
... Well. Well, that's up to him. <cf>If he does his duty, that's fine.
?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
I'll have a quick look around the town and then go back to my research.

sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin

With all the turmoil relaxation, I thought we had no time for the Star Spirit Festival.

Player
It is with joy that we welcome the Celestial Spirit Diva and hold the Celestial Spirit Festival.

npc_priest_1stClass
Player
I thank the God of Bafaria. <cf>And to you all for your feelings.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
Thank you very much
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
This time, the Diva's stage is something special. <cf>We Priests will also choose as much as possible.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
We must show our lives to God, even if only to one person at a time. <cf>Today, the theater is the center of the Bafarian festival.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
Thank you for being the temple.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
I never thought that there would be scoundrels like that who would attack the temple during the Star Spirit Festival...
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
This is truly recognizable. <cf>And we should be ashamed of thoughts for relaxation it to lose.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
We need to worry about the security of the temple from now on. <cf>We need to worry about our faith in God.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Player
Oh dear. I thought that once the Star Spirit Festival was over, I would be able to go home after.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
After such a commotion, we can't just throw our emotions.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
We Are Also Asking the Soundrels Who Wants the Songstress and the Temple.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
But... Miss Charlotte is lucky to be safe. <cf>Did you allow thieves to get in behind the theater?
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
When you're pressing that hard, there's something wrong you can do.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
It feels like he's a person with bad luck... <cf>No, this is my story.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
If I find out anything, I'll let the temple know.
?
Npc_Hugo
Player
As You Can See, We Are Guards Dispatched from the Duchy of Barnhardt.
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier
Player
After all that trouble so soon... <cf>I expected that we would face strong feelings.
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier
Player
The People of Asterlies and Those Associated with the Bafarian Church Are Willing to Succeed with Us for the Star Spirit Festival.

Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier

I FEEL ASHAMED OF MYSELF FOR FEELING MASSAGES

Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier
Player
I think there are some people who can't resolve their grudges.

Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier

But this exchange is good for both sides. <cf>It is our responsibility to make sure that shampoo.

Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier

Right is good! Left is good! No worries today!

Hmmm! So you think I'm tired?! <cf>IT'S NO WONDER THE PEOPLE OF ASTERLIES THINK SO.

Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier
Player
I'm very sorry for the recent incident. <cf>I can't lose to the Bafaria cult.

Npc_Barnhardt_Soldier
Player
At the very least, we seek to protect the Star Spirit Festival that everyone is looking forward to with all our heart and soul!

Npc_Tribesmen
Player
There Were A Lot Of Stalls, So <cf>I Just Came Here To Fill My Stalls.
?
Npc_Tribesmen
Player
So, I should go to the theater, right? <cf>But where?
?
Npc_Tribesmen
Player
This city is too big. The Roads Are So Bad, It's Too Bad to Get Lost Than in the Forest.
?
Npc_Tribesmen

Wow, a human has just come to me...!

Npc_Bapharia_Guard

I'm looking forward to hearing what kind of singing voice she will give us.

Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Wow... that song was way beyond my Imagineation.

Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Of Course, I'm Talking About The Star Spirit Diva. <cf>I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD TURN OUT LIKE THAT.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
I heard some amazing cheers and even cheers I was here I was just as tired as if I was inside.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
I can't help but open the door and peek inside. <cf>I'll have to submit a letter of apology later.
?
Npc_Bapharia_Guard
Player
Hey, done! Got it!
?
Npc_Atl_Citizen
Player
The Guards Are Patrolling the Far Corners of the Temple. <cf>It's relaxing like the sleeping places are going to be sick!

It's impossible to sneak in! <cf>If You Go In With The Beginning That You'll Be Found From The Start...

Npc_Troupe_Leader

I was pregnant! <cf>I didn't even have been telling about it.

If you had just told me, I would have flown over. <cf>really...

Npc_Troupe_Leader
Player
Well, I'm glad you're doing well. <cf>It'll add some prestige to your next performance!

Npc_Troupe_Leader

But would it be okay to invite the Celestial Diva to the troupe's performance? Hmm...

Npc_Troupe_Leader

I heard <cf>Charlotte Presents as the Celestial Spirit Diva?

Npc_Troupe_Madam

I'm honored that she has been given such an important role. <cf>I hope I'm not worried any trouble to worry.

Npc_Troupe_Madam
Player
That's good enough, if you're doing well, that's good enough.
?
Npc_Troupe_Madam

If you're a Star Spirit Diva, your name will be in many places. <cf>Maybe it will even reach the child's real parents.

I hope things turn out for the better

My Goodness, The Star Spirit Festival was quite a commotion.

I chose that Lalaforte relaxing song, but I didn't think she would be so quiet at the Star Spirit Festival.

I didn't go overboard last time either.

But... The Performance with Charlotte and Milène was Lively and Good.

Npc_Priest
Player
High Priest Lugerio felt me a bitter look, but <cf>it was very well received by the townspeople.

Npc_Priest

Customs and customs should be closed. <cf>However, I don't think we should be too attached to them.

The Star Spirit Festival is a solemn and dignified festival dedicated to the God of Baphalia.

Npc_Priest

Do you want? IT'S BEAUTIFUL NOT A FESTIVAL WHERE PEOPLE GET SHOOT AND MAKE NOISE AND HAVE NO CLASS.
?
Npc_Priest
Player
The Celestial Diva must also be sacred and dignified.

Npc_Priest
Player
And you put that up on a poster in a big way! <cf>What a way to pray to God. How outrageous!

PLEASE DO NOT RUN OR MAKE NOISE INSIDE THE THEATER. <cf>Please be afraid not to cause trouble to others.

Npc_Ryugerio

About that second song, <cf>how do you think we should evaluate it?
m
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
There's been so much going on that I almost never...
m
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
The Beloved Problem That the Beloved Saw Was That Such a Song Was Supposed at the Star Spirit Festival.
m
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
There is no tradition or formality, just frivolution... Ah, how comfortable.
m
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
This is not a good example for the believers. <cf>They have done something on their own.

How much effort we put into the Star Spirit Festival...

Grisonia grass should be growing in clusters in growing places on Cape Lawehara.

And to use it as a poison, <cf>it must be present immediately after poisoning.
m
Npc_Lalaforte

If there is a hideout, <cf>it is very close to the colony.
m
Npc_Lalaforte

They know it's a dangerous poison, so locals don't go near it.

Death of the Commander of the Knights, even a high-ranking civil official <cf>everyone's shock is uncontrollable.

However, there is also the Matter of the Attack on the Star Spirit Festival. <cf>We must also maintain the security of the “Temple of Divine Blessing.”

As a duchy in the Duchy of Barnhardt, we must not allow anything to ignore to the Oracle's Priestess.

Cleaning Up After the Star Spirit Festival is a lot of work. <cf>I don't think the general public will be allowed into the theater for a while.
m
Npc_Bapharia_Guard

But a lot of people come just to see the attraction, and it's become like a tourist spot.
m
Npc_Bapharia_Guard

These Star Spirit Diva girls must have become really popular.
m
Npc_Bapharia_Guard

Oh, Grizonia grass? <cf>We don't sell that.

Player
It's a breeding plant that's breeding for hunting animals in the forest. <cf>It loved that the forest people had been using it for a long time.

But fishing is the basis of Jubilia. <cf>You can't poison the sea, can you?
m
Npc_Shopkeeper

I've never heard of a store selling it around here. <cf>If you want it, you'll have to collect it yourself.
m
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
It's supposed there's going to be it's going to be sick. <cf>However, it's dangerous, so be dangerous when you touch them.
m
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
It's wrong that the products that customers want at Jubilia are different from those at Asterlies.
m
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Seasonings, durable clothing, and farm equipment sell well. <cf>Bafaria's Legacy isn't very popular.
m
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Jubilia is still in the process of development. <cf>It seems that if there are too many things, they end up wasting them.
m
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
It would be great if trade became more prosperous and <cf>various things would thrive.
m
Npc_Shopkeeper
Player
Since then, there has been no change in tirith's behavior.
m
Npc_Aerinse
Player
When Einrein Sang, <cf>why did Tirith's sleeping surface?

I also liked singing a song that Tiris, but apparently there was no change.

Exam advice
This is your first adventurer rank-up battle. <lf>So, I'll give you some advice.
Remember the Adventurer registration exam. <lf>I'm sure you've made some equipment that will be useful in battle.
First, sorry. Don't Forget to Equip the “Adventures” series.
Then there's Enhance Imaginee. <lf>Are you tired shampoo with 'E-Cucumber'?
Yes, you can also use Battle Imaginee. <lf>“B-Goblin” or other things.
The rest is to look around makeup and make good use of things that relaxation shampoo.
The <lf>Reclamation Bureau's Sorry Aren't So Easy That You Can Just Brute Force Your Way Through Them, You Know?
Make sure you're well prepared and ready for the big day. <lf>We're rooting for you. Good luck!
THE KEY TO THIS RANKUP BATTLE IS <lf>“STUNNING STUN RESISTANCE”
It is IMPORTANT to Equip the Essentials Enhance Imaginee to Expect the Fainting of “Fainting.”
<lf>'E-Asterlies Seen in the Distance' has the effect of 'Stun Resistance'
Also, I recommend equipping a second enhance Imagine to boost your motivation<lf>.
Any Enhance Imaginee is fine, but <lf>choose one that is as effective as possible.
If Possible, Equip Two Battle Imagines to Make the Battle Go More Intrigued.
Many Adventurers Get Stumbled Due to Being “Unconscious,” So <lf>Be Sure to Take All Incurable!
This is the place to test the results of your adventure. <lf>Make full use of what you've felt.
In this rank-up battle, you'll need to worry against “Paralysis” and “Lightning Attribute”
Just like in the previous rank-up battle, <lf>each of them has an enhance Imagine that resists their resistance.
<lf>'Paralysis Resistance Up' is 'E-Flocking Dragonfly'
'Overcoming Lightning Resistance' is <lf>'E-On the Banks of the Melisos River'
YOU'D BETTER COLLECT THESE TWO ENHANCE IMAGINES BEFORE THE RANK-UP BATTLE.
If Possible, You Should Equip Enhance Imaginee with All Five Symbols.
And don't forget your feelings. <lf>The “Path of the Gods” series is a good choice.
Be especially vulnerable of conditions. <lf>From now on, the monsters will get tougher, so get used to it.
THE KEY TO THIS RANKUP BATTLE IS <lf>“EARTH RESISTANCE” AND “POISON RESISTANCE”
First, “E - End of Dry Wind”. <lf>This has the effect of “Feeling Earth Attribute Resistance”
Also, “E-Manifest Threat, Eternal Roar.” <lf>This One Is Stronger for “Poison Resistance Up”
If you have it, I also believe “E-Handmade Value”
IT HAS THE EFFECT OF “TAKEN DAMAGE TAKEN,” SO IT IS AN EFFECTIVE IMAGINEE NOT ONLY FOR RANKUP BATTLES.
The “Silent Remembrance” series is a good weapon. <lf>It might be tough if it doesn't have that much power.
First, control the damage you receive and avoid falling.
And attack to win the battle. <lf>You have to be conscious of both in a balanced way.
This time, it's said that even the rank-up battles are going to happen. <lf>Show us your skills. We look forward to seeing you!
How's your adventure board? <lf>I hope everything is going well
Don't Just Raise Your Adventurer Rank, Try Various Adventures.
The more you rewards, the more rewards you'll get, so it'll be fun!

Why don't you listen to it for a bit? <cf>Even if you know it, it's worth reviewing it.

Well, before we go to battle, let's do a quick review.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
The thing that Aegis Fighter must be the most aggressive about is how to handle the shield.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
The shield is the symbol of the Aegis Fighter. <cf>It is only because of this shield that we can protect our allies.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
We have Swords. Attack is important, of course. <cf>But we must not defend ourselves.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
When fighting an enemy, don't just attack, but also be aware of using a shield to block and protect yourself.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
However, if you only play defenseless, you will lose defenseless. <cf>While defending, look for an opportunity to attack.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
If you mix in some skills, you'll be able to fight more like an Aegis Fighter.
:

Please be careful<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Make sure you have a good balance between attack and defense.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
When we're done, let's meet up here again
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
Good job. That was a great job. <cf>I didn't need to tell you that.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
How to use a shield and sword. How to use skills. <cf>If you do that, you'll be able to be with your allies musicians.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Was that not enough for you? <cf>Hahaha! Sorry then.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
... The most important thing for an Aegis Fighter is to protect what needs to be protected.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
That is why we must fight. <cf>Put the will to protect into your shield and swing your sword.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player
It's easy to say, but hard to keep up that attitude. <cf>But I'm sure you'll be fine.
:
Npc_Fighter
Player

The request is to kill a monster in Minsterhorn. <cf>This is not an optional request.
P
Npc_Fighter

However, if you are facing a belligerent person, it can be troublesome if they attack you.
P

Just in case, we want to defend our defenses. <cf>In that case, the Aegis Fighter is called in.

Is he after cooking? No, judging from his actions so far, it's highly motivated he will attack people.
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
The damage has been done <cf>It's best to hate them
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
Leave it to me. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>If it's an accident, it'll be a breeze between me and this guy.
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
It would be a problem if there were other troublesome people
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Is it possible that there are monsters other than these?
P
Npc_Villager
Npc_Fighter
Mysterious, vicious monsters can kill. <cf>They are elusive. They can stay at any time and place.
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
... I've met such monsters before.
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
...? What's long? <cf>You Sounded Pretty Gloomy.
P
Npc_Villager
Npc_Fighter
No, nothing. Sorry. <cf>That's not relevant right now.
P
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Villager
I'll go to the highway first and check the mountains. <cf>Can you follow me?
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
... That Aegis Fighter, <cf>he has a bit of a dark side.
P
Npc_Villager
Player
Did you have any bitter memories? <cf>Maybe you said something bad.
P
Npc_Villager
Player
I'm sorry. I'm being rude. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>I'd beat your help in defeating it.

P
Npc_Fighter
Player
If we lose the people around here, <cf>we should be able to cause any harm damage.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
I don't want to get close to the village if possible. <cf>I WANT TO CONTROL THE FRONT LINE AND FIGHT WELL.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
Defense using a shield is the key to an Aegis Fighter. <cf>However, if you only compete, you will run out of strength.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
Defend your suspect's attack and restrict their chances, then use the opportunity to attack.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
You can attack while defending something. <cf>That is the true strength of the Aegis Fighter.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
... That's right. We fight while fighting.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
Now, let's protect Minsterhorn and the people! <cf>Let's split up.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's discuss the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> in each other's areas. <cf>When we're done, let's meet up again around here.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's relax <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> in '' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
When you're done, gather here. <cf>Let's fight to fight the Minsterhorn!
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
Good job. Looks like you kicked those <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>guys away.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
I'm okay too. <cf>Now they won't come near the village.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
As Expected, You Are An Excellent Aegis Fighter <cf>You were able to protect what you had to protect. I can count on you.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
... what? <cf>Do I look like I'm tired about something?
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
... I just have some memories of monsters attacking attacks.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
If I'm with you, someday...
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
[--] No. Sorry, nothing. <cf>Just let it go.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
If there is another request, please lend me your strength. <cf>I want to see your appearance as an Aegis Fighter.
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
To me, it looks dazzling. <cf>Like a treasure that was lost treasure...
P
Npc_Fighter
Player
So far, I haven't received any requests that would require your help.
P
Npc_Fighter

But I will need your help soon...

Player
I don't think it will be anything too rough... <cf>In any case, it would be a great help if you came.
F

First, let's start with the “High Helm Beans”. <cf>They can be seen at “<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>” on the Bahamar Valley.

F

He's not afraid you can lose to, but be tired. <cf>I'll take care of the care of the 'Akakara Grass' for you.
F
Npc_Fighter
Player
Oh, adventurers! You have snacks <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>.
F
Npc_merchant
Player
Ah. This guy did a great job. <cf>As you can see, I was able to collect some 'Akakarakusa' as well.
F
Npc_Fighter
Npc_merchant
Oh, thank you so much. <cf>It's really cool
F

How about you?
F
Npc_Fighter
Npc_merchant
This is the person who brought the thrill from Ritz. <cf>He came here a while ago.
F

I was in trouble because I couldn't get home because I wanted to be on the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> road.
F
Npc_merchant
Player
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks to you I can go back to Ritz

Um... <cf>Are you Aegis Fighters, right?
F
Npc_Young_Man
Player
That's right. <cf>We are both Aegis Fighters.
F
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
Speaking of Aegis Fighters, in the past... <cf>That Man was also an Aegis Fighter...
F
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Young_Man
... Hey, haven't we met before? <cf>I feel like I've seen you before...
F
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
Eh? Ah...! <cf>No, I thought maybe it was just my Imagineation...
F
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
Um, sorry. <cf>I'll be off now.
F
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
Well, it's about time for me to join in too. <cf>Thank you both so much!

Litze's Young Man... Judging from his age... <cf>... No, that's impossible
F
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Fighter
When I was just starting out, I fought against monsters that scared away.
F
Npc_Fighter
Player
But I can't help it. <cf>I was alone and inexperienced...
F
Npc_Fighter
Player
If I had had a friend like you at that time, the chances might have been different.
F
Npc_Fighter
Player
That's why I'm happy that I was able to help people by asking the request with you this time.
F
Npc_Fighter
Player
If anything asks again, I'd like to ask for your help. <cf>I look forward to working with you again.
F
Npc_Fighter
Player
Thank you for the other day. <cf>Your growth is relaxation.

It feels like that a request has come from Ritz
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
... I have some relaxation. <cf>Should I accept it? What should I do?
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
f
A Request from the Baths of Ritz. <cf>I need your help again.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
It's been going that crazy people have been going around the village.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Nothing has happened yet. <cf>But the villagers are tired.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
... Do you remember the time when I, as a teenager, let a monster get away?
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
At that time, it was <cf>Ritze who was being married by the monster.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I was asked to kill monsters and protect the village, but I couldn't have asked that request...
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I haven't been to Ritz since then. <cf>I feel guilty, I can't help it...
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
But we can't keep going that forever. <cf>There are people who are helpful for help like this.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
It's thanks to you that I felt this way. <cf>With you, I'm sure I can protect Litze this time.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I'm like this, but please lend me your strength.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
First, let's hear from Ritz what's going on
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Been drinking people have been sleeping around Ritz
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's go and listen to the story first. <cf>Ritze is a village in the Montegnor Valley.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Huh? <cf>You guys met before in Lalpal...
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>. <cf>Thank you for your help.
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
Are you the young man who became married to the merchant? <cf>We have just received a request.
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
I heard that a strange person was sitting in Litze.
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
Did you guys accept the request?
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
I saw a teenager man. <cf>He was walking around the village and looking into houses.
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
I'm not from the village. No one knows me, and <cf>if I try to talk to them they run away.
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
But he came back and wandered around the village again. <cf>It's not like he did anything to me...
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
That shampoo feels good <cf>Okay. Let's start by looking for that guy.
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
There must be other people who saw it. <cf>Let's talk to the villagers.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
A sleeping man is wandering around Ritz
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
I think there are other people who have seen it happen to me. <cf>Please listen to what everyone has to say.
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
A miniature man wandering around the village? <cf>Yeah, I saw that too.
l
Npc_Villager
Player
You shouldn't judge a person by their appearance, but <cf>he had a dark side to him.
l
Npc_Villager
Player
THE TIMES WHEN YOU SEE THEM ARE ALSO DIFFERENT
l
Npc_Villager
Player
He's out and about morning, noon, and night. <cf>My friend said he saw him too, so there's no harm about it.
l
Npc_Villager
Player
Is there really that much to see in this village?
l
Npc_Villager
Player
I see... <cf>It feels like you're not just a traveler.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
He is walking through the village very tired. <cf>It's as if he is tired the teenager.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
The Man May Be There. <cf>Let's look around the village a bit more.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
The Smoothly Man has been tired at various times
l
Npc_Villager
Player
Maybe he's still going to the village? <cf>If so, that's disgusting...
l
Npc_Villager
Player
Wh, what? <cf>I'm not worried or anything...
l
Npc_strangeman
Player
[--]! You are... cause! <cf>Are you Cause from the Aegis Fighter?
l
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
Do you know me?
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
Oh, I know that well...
l
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
What does a guy who ran away from a monster want from Ritz now?
l
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
Because of you, I lost my field! <cf>Now I'm sniffing around the village...
l
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
IT'S YOUR FAULT THAT THIS ISSUES! <cf>Damn you, damn you!
l
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
... That Man is wrong one of the bandits.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
He went to the mountains. <cf>There is a place for outlaws to gather.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Thought they were leaving the village and waiting for an opportunity to attack.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
You'd better act before they made their move.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's talk that <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>shampoo in ``“! <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>

Npc_Fighter

Let's talk that <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>shampoo in ``“! <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I'll take the initiative before they attack the village. <cf>Once I've finished, I'll report back to the young man who helped me.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Have You Found Out Who Was That Strange Man?
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
... a group of bandits? <cf>So you were dressed an eye on the village!
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>Has been busy. <cf>I'm glad. Thank you very much.
l
Npc_Young_Man
Player
I can't find the man, but <cf>he can't do anything on his own.
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
But... that man wanted me. <cf>It played he was born a resident of Ritz.
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
He said he lost his farm because of me
l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
A Resident of Ritz? <cf>And because of you, I lost my field...
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
... I see! <cf>You're the Aegis Fighter from back then!
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
He Went to the Monster That Went to the Village, and <cf>Just Run Away!
l

Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter

l
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
You're tired us!
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
The village was ravaged, the houses and fields were tired. <cf>Ritze was on the verge of destruction at that time!
l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
Cors. Are you still an adventurer? <cf>You Can't Protect Us!

Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter

l
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
... sorry. <cf>I got you excited...
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Hey, can you bring me to the edge of the village? <cf>It's too public to talk here.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Hey, could you talk to me to the edge of the village?
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
If I talk here, I'll be seen. <cf>Other people might know me.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
This used to be a field. <cf>It feels to be tired now.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
This is the scar of what I've done...
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
When I was a freak adventurer, <cf>there was a monster that scared Ritz.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I was tasked with defeating him... <cf>I thought I was no match for him, so I ran away.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
At that time, there was a child who tried to protect the village. <cf>That must be the young man.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I didnt mean to lie about my promise. <cf>But as a result, I chose a big liar...
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Since then, I've tried to turn my eyes away from Ritz
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I this request because I felt I had accepted to face my past.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
But I still don't know what I can do...
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT PEOPLE HATE ME. <cf>I don't know how to make up for it.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
But if something happened to Ritz, then I chose to clear my name.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
Sorry for the Deathly story. <cf>I just wanted you to know
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
If I ever get a chance to make amends, <cf>I'd be happy if you could help me.
l
Npc_Fighter
Player
I'm excited gathering information about Ritz

It doesn't feel right... <cf>I hope it's just my Imagineation.

Thank you for lending me your strength. <cf>Nothing is more reassuring than your help.

Npc_Fighter

As I Took Before, When I Was Just Starting Out, I Ran Away From the Monster That Stood Ritz.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
That was an ogre called “Flame Prison”.

Npc_Fighter
Player
It is unknown what happened of him after he ravaged Ritz. <cf>I Have Never Seen Him or Heard of Him Being Seen
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
[--] Until the Other Day,

Npc_Fighter
Player
An Ogre was originally near Ritze. <cf>Its crimes are very similar to those of the “Fire Prison.”
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
He's excited again. <cf>... I can't help but think so.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I've been rejecting it for a long time. <cf>I have to face my face
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
That's why I've been fighting as an Aegis Fighter
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's talk to Ritze. <cf>We need to find out the true identity of the Ogre.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
If it's “Fire Prison,” I'll hate it this time. <cf>Even if it's not, I'll protect Ritz!

Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
We will kill them. <cf>Please tell me more about it.

Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
Is it too late now? You Run Away Once
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE DONE, <cf>WE WILL NEVER MAKE YOU DONE!
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
I can't escape enough for escaping from the 'Flame Prison' before...
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
But even so... no, because of that! <cf>This time, I can't just sit back and watch.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
This time, I will be leaving the “Flame Prison”. <cf>Please give me a chance.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
...
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
... I think the Ogre that shampoo is the “Flame Hell”. <cf>Everyone is worried there's no harm about it.
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
However, I heard that it was a size larger than before. <cf>I was a child at the time, so I don't remember clearly.
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
It's relaxing shampoo... <cf>Did that mean it's grown and became pregnant?
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
That may be so. <cf>Corse. You Were No Match for the Old “Fire Prison”
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
You still think you can beat them? <cf>You really think you can protect the village?

Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man

Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, <cf>YOU ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WE CAN STAND ON HERE RIGHT NOW.

Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
Okay. Thank you
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
Let's ask where the ogres pose. <cf>Someone should know.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
There must be someone else in the village who knows where the ogres teenager.
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES I CAN JUST ON. <cf>... I'm counting on you.
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
Corse! You're here again?
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
You're the Bandit from the Other Day! <cf>You're still in Ritz...
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
The Bandits are out of business. <cf>You loved my friends.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
I see... <cf>Hey, did you live in this village?
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
Yes, that's right. My appearance changed, and none of the villagers changed.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
At that time... after you escaped. <cf>The “Fire Prison” hosts the village.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
The fields were occupied, the houses were occupied... <cf>The village was in Ruins. My fields were busy.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
I can't live like that. <cf>I left the village and wandered around...
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
Before I chose it, I had to become a member of a bandit gang.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
But that ended thanks to you guys. <cf>Well... that was supposed to be a good thing.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
While I was thinking about what to do next, I heard someone say that they saw a big ogre.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
Does I Wonder If “Fire Prison” have another chance?
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
I just can't help but wonder... <cf>I ended up back in Ritz again
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
I also came here after hearing that story. <cf>This time I will throw the “Flame Prison”.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
I'm not the same person I was back then. <cf>And now I have friends I can make friends on.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
Leave the Matter of 'Hell of Fire' to us.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
... You're serious. Cause
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
The “Fire Prison” is in the “Melisos River Basin”. <cf>I saw the footprints. There's No Longer About It.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
[--] Thank you
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
Let's go. “Fire Prison” is a formidable enemy. <cf>But this time, we can't run away.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Fight with me! <cf>To protect Ritze [--]!
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
“Fire Prison” is in the “Melisos River Basin”
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
You're planning to attack Ritz again. <cf>The rest is up to you, Aegis Fighter.
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
There he is... “Fire Prison”
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
... Damn, my hands are shaking even at this point...
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I know. <cf>I STILL CAN'T SHAKE THE PHANTOMS OF THE PAST.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
The reason why is “Fire Prison” pretence rather than it should be is because of my own misery.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
But [--] I can't drag the people of Ritz into my own infamous ever again.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I can't show you any more uncomfortable things.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's go. The time to fight is now!
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I am the Aegis fighter's command! <cf>I Will Go With My Trusted Comrades!!
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
...

Npc_Fighter
Player

Npc_Fighter
Player
We did it! We celebrate the 'Flame Prison'!
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Hahaha...! Good job, thank you! <cf>IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU FIGHTING TOGETHER ME!
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Now the “Fire Prison” will never attack the village again. <cf>This time, the people's protection has finally come true...
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I don't know how to thank you
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Oh, I can't go on like this. <cf>I'll go back to Ritz and tell the young man.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
[“] It's OK now. <cf>Aegis Fighter has kept its promises [”],
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Let's go back to Ritz and tell that young man.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
The “Fire Prison” has been busy. <cf>Ritze is fine now.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Are you all safe?
?
Npc_Young_Man
Player
You've bought 'Flame Prison'. <cf>This time, for real...!
?
Npc_Young_Man
Player
Ah, I'm tired him
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
It doesn't mean that your past escapes have been for given...
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
But even so, you kept your promises. <cf>I'm really happy...
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
I feel like tears are coming out...
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
... Oh, that's right. I heard that you saw that bandit man who was wandering around the village before again...
?
Npc_Young_Man
Npc_Fighter
Oh, I met him. <cf>It's okay. He doesn't do anything wrong.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_Young_Man
Unless I talk to that guy, I can't really settle things with the past.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Please bear with me a little shower. <cf>Let's try to find that guy.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
You've finally promised your promise to promise 'Hellfire'
?
Npc_Young_Man
Player
Thank you <cf>Please tell that bandit too.
?
Npc_Young_Man
Player
But it meant that he used to be a resident of this village.
?
Npc_Young_Man
Player
Corse! <cf>Did you say the “Flame Prison”!?
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
Yeah. This guy got me out.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE AEGIS FIGHTER WOULD RETURN TO JUST THE MONSTER...
?
Npc_strangeman
Player
That's why I got to play Aegis Fighter.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
Someday, I will face my past and lose it.
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
I can't believe it just at words... <cf>But after what I've done, there's no way I don't believe it!
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
You guys are amazing!
?
Npc_strangeman
Npc_Fighter
What are you going to do now?
?
Npc_Fighter
Npc_strangeman
Yeah... I'll try again. <cf>I'll plow the field again.
?
Npc_strangeman
Player
See you. Come to this village again. <cf>Aegis Fighter!
?
Npc_strangeman
Player
Thank you <cf>I was able to take a step forward from My Regrets.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I aim for the top as an Aegis Fighter <cf>It's because you were with me
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
You didn't just protect Ritze. You protected my heart too.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
THE DESIRE TO PROTECT SOMETHING AND FIGHT...
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
That Will Is What An Aegis Fighter Needs Most.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I felt I felt that strong feeling from you.
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
I was able to feel that way again. <cf>[--] Thank you so much!
?
Npc_Fighter
Player
Hey, how are you? <cf>Do you see what do we need to protect?

Npc_Fighter

@
Npc_Striker
Player
People call him the “First Twin Striker”! <cf>Kaaaah! It's amazing, I'm enchanting!
@
Npc_Striker
Player
According to the “Compendium of Heroes,” the hero Achim was born where Ritz is now.
@
Npc_Striker
Player
He was a woodcutter, but <cf>his wife and child were married by the Dragon Tribe, so he fought to fight.
@
Npc_Striker
Player
He Moved to the West Barnhardt Peninsula and Happened Great Success in Battle, and The King at That Time Called Him...
@
Npc_Striker
Player
... Oh, that's right! I made a request!
@
Npc_Striker
Player
sorry! I get excited when I talk about Ahim. <cf>My friends often tell me off.

My friend collapsed from collapsed pain. We Were Planning to Decide <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>

Npc_Striker
Player
... Huh? Oh, it's you! <cf>I've been waiting for you. Are you ready?
@
Npc_Striker
Player
I was just reviewing the Twin Striker manual on how to fight.
@
Npc_Striker
Player
According to this book, <cf>“The Key to the Twin Striker is to Keep Attacking!”
@
Npc_Striker
Player
“The More You Attack, The Sharper Your Axe Will Become. <cf>Step Forward Fearlessly and Slam the Blade Down!”
@
Npc_Striker
Player
... That's right. <cf>Close combat is fighting where the Twin Striker Shines!

<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Says there are six of them to believe in total. <cf>Let's split up and throw them in groups of three.

Ouch. I was too focused on attacking. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Counterfeats me.
@
Npc_Striker
Player
I re-read the textbook and the “Encyclopedia of Heroes” and found that it was a written statement.
@
Npc_Striker
Player
Not only attacking, but also dodging enemy attacks is also attacking for a Twin Striker...
@
Npc_Striker
Player
Oh, I jumped to hell. <cf>At this rate, when will I be able to become a hero?
@
Npc_Striker
Player
Oh, but you're very fine. <cf>I see. Those who can be scared can do it!

All the right! I'm not going to give up! <cf>I'll become a hero like Achim Someday!

Npc_Striker

Npc_Striker
Player
<cf>The Legend of Ahim, The Hero I Aspire to Be, also includes A Story about Defeating! <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
R
Npc_Striker

The Twin Striker manual also fights this episode and a fighting style that is similar to it.
R
Npc_Striker
Player
'Even continuous relaxation, you need to believe the number and position of your motivation and use your axe relaxation. '
R
Npc_Striker

“A first-class warrior is able to sweep through groups of wars, target attacks in the sky, and attack according to the attacks.”

It is said that people have redeemed land and property stolen by goblins, and that <cf>it has saved stolen homes.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Even though they were fighting goblins, they had the noisy to not plunder or engage in pointless extermination.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Oh, that's not what I'm talking about. <cf>It's about “Vortex Impact”!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Hmm...
a
Npc_Striker
Player
It meant that lothal could also be used, but <cf>it meant that there was no description of how to use it.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Is there a book like a textbook on reading?
a
Npc_Striker
Player
... That's right! <cf>Let's ask a senior twin striker!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Are there a lot of adventurers here, right? <cf>Let's ask someone downstairs.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's ask the senior adventurer on the first floor.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
I'm sure there are people out there who can use “Vortex Impact”!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Can you tell me how to use “Vortex Impact”?
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
Yes! I'm a Twin Striker, but I'm still not good at using it...
a
Npc_Striker
Npc_Adventurer_senior
That's right... <cf>I chose it from my master.
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
It's not so much a method as it is an effective timing. <cf>You feel like you know how to move your body, right?
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
When you're fighting, there's that moment when you think, “This is it!”
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
Then it felt natural to use
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
I was fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> when it came. <cf>Once you can use it, you'll get used to it.
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
I see... that's the moment it clicked. <cf>Thank you, senpai!
a
Npc_Striker
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Oh, good luck. See you then.
a
Npc_Adventurer_senior
Npc_Striker
I can overcome the movement of “Vortex Impact” <cf>too...
a
Npc_Striker
Player
So, what motivation is the moment that the senior spoke about.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Now that I think about it, you said you were fighting <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/><cf>, right?
a
Npc_Striker
Player
That's what Achim's book said too... <cf>Maybe <value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/> is the key?
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Okay, let's try it!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>Let's go it. <cf>I'm going to drink it for the sake of “Vortex Impact”
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Try fighting and let me know how it fights. <cf>Maybe I'll get some new hints.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
There's no point in defeating something so weak... <cf>Okay, let's go to '<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>'!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
There might be someone there who is worth a shot. <cf>Let's check out the Cult's Garrison First!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
In order to use “Vortex Impact”, it helps the best thing to do is gain experience in actual combat.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's Fight the Elder Goblins in the Andorra Basin. <cf>There are some good ones there
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's go to the Bafarian Cult's Garrison for now. <cf>From there, we'll try the “Vortex Impact”!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
I'm sure there is a Goblin Camp in the Forest of Andorra Basin.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
I hear there are Elder Goblins roaming the area.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Some people even come as far as the Minsterhorn.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
We have to practice “Vortex Impact”, but we can't just leave the monsters alone!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Okay, let's start hunting Elder Goblins! <cf>When we're done, meet up here again!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's have fun! “Vortex Impact”!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's split up and throw the Elder Goblins in this area.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
I'm going to practice “Vortex Impact.” <cf>You can try it too if you like it.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
It would be nice if you could tell me how it happened. <cf>Let's meet up here again when we're done!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Hey, good job! You feel good <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Of course, I've been defeating them all!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Did we make a “Vortex Impact”? <cf>Well, that's...
a
Npc_Striker
Player
It felt like that, but it didn't feel like that... <cf>Hmm, but I'm still not getting it.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
In the end, the technique didn't work.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
... Okay, let's check again! <cf>I can't give up just like this.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
To be a hero, <cf>“Vortex Impact” is a dangerous surprise!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
What am I missing? What is the difference between a hero and me? <cf>If I can lose that, I feel like I can use it.
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Thank you for having us! <cf>I'll ask you again if I need anything!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
I want to use “Vortex Impact”! <cf>I won't give up!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
Practise, let's practice! <cf>Let's do it, to become a hero!
a
Npc_Striker
Player
[PATH]225*\Scenario\CAV102_004.uasset[PATH]
It's not going so well. <cf>“Vortex Impact”...
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Hmm, maybe it would be nice to go relaxation for a change.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
H
Hey! <cf>Are you using “Vortex Impact”?
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I still can't do it. <cf>I guess there's something crucially missing.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
So, I thought about it. <cf>I'm afraid haven't done that yet!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
[--] Pilgrimage!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
It's also part of the Bafarian training, right? <cf>The One Where You Travel and Visit Places Associated with God!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
In my case, I should follow in the footsteps of heroes like Ahim!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
If you get close to the hero in this way, you should be able to use “Vortex Impact”!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
... Yeah, well. <cf>I just want to go!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I would really like to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land of the Hero Achim, but <cf>I'm from the Duchy of Barnhardt, so that's a bit tired.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
So, let's follow the local heroes. <cf>Let's go to Minsterhorn first!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
That's Where the Hero Lothar, Who Conquered the “Great Dragon's Claw Marks”, was born.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's go to the Minsterhorn!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
This is the birthplace of the hero Lothar. <cf>There May Be Hints Hidden There That Will Help You Become A Hero!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I've been to the Minsterhorn many times, but <cf>it's been special when I think of it as a pilgrimage to the Holy Land of Heroes!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
This is the birthplace of the hero Lothar.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Lothar is an adventurer who pursues the “Dragon Claw Marks” and formed a team called “Dragon Claws”.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
That team was the first to traverse the “Giant Dragon's Claw Marks”!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
The Thoughts That Lothar and His Friends Overcame Are Still Being Taken On By Many Adventurers Today.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
The name is “The Way of the Dragon”! It's cool!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Heroes are amazing! <cf>They scored a goal for people even after scoring or winning.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I also want to leave a big mark and become a great person who can give college to the future!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Well, If You Follow in Lothal's Footsteps, You Can't Leave Out “The Claw Marks of the Giant Dragon”
N
Npc_Striker
Player
It's the place where Lothal was most active. <cf>There's no reason not to go and see it!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Next, let's go to the ``Giant Dragon's Claw Marks”!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's Go to the Front of “The Giant Dragon's Claw Marks”
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Don't go inside yet? <cf>First, I want to feel the Breath of the Hero Lothar from outside!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
So this is the “Giant Dragon's Claw Mark”! <cf>Wow, just looking at it is amazing...
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Once Conquered by Heroes, Will Heroes of the Future still challenge it?
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Wow, that's so cool! <cf>I'd like to try and conquer on my own someday!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
With my skill, it's still going for me to go all the way to the back. <cf>I guess I need the “Vortex Impact” after all.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
The hero Lothar has many monsters here.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
The Battle with the Goblins is famous, but there are many other stories left behind.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
THE STORY OF THE TYRANT BOA'S SLAYING IS EVEN TALKED IN THE SONGS OF BARS.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I WANT TO RECREATE THIS LEGEND!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Dressed <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_03001"/>at<value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Get closer and closer to being a hero. <cf>Let's take our first steps as heroes!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
When You're Done, Meet at the Dawn to “The Giant Dragon's Claw Marks”. <cf>Please don't go home alone, okay?
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's have fun <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_03001"/>at! <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Meet Me at the Beginning when you're done. <cf>Please don't go home alone.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Ouch, ouch... I fought the full Brunt of<cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_03001"/>'s Attack.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Oh, you've also finished your slaying. <cf>You've always been well as always.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I was hit and blown away
N
Npc_Striker
Player
I was worried to do “Vortex Impact” and <cf>I failed, and then I was defeated out
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Yeah. I can't use it this time either.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
But I won't give up! <cf>Being a hero is my dream!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
Also, I was able to fight at “The Giant Dragon's Claw Mark”, so <cf>I felt a little confidence.
N
Npc_Striker
Player
So, next time I'll try that.

N
Npc_Striker
Player
“Vortex Impact”... <cf>Why can't I use it...!
N
Npc_Striker
Player
But I won't give up! <cf>I'm going to be a hero!

Npc_Striker

Desired You'd Be Inside the Ruins. <cf>Why are you wandering around outside...?

Player
But that<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>... <cf>Something's long.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
They're dead found in the ruins of Bafaria. <cf>It wants their job is to protect the ruins.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
So you shouldn't be wandering around outside.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
But the <value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/> I found was wandering around the Montegnor Valley.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
And, little by little, I'm getting closer to Ritz!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>IS A TYPICAL ENEMY THAT ATTENTION IN HEROIC TALES. <cf>He is strong and proud to be fought by ordinary warriors.

Npc_Striker
Player
When You're in a Pinch, <cf>The Hero Ahim Dashed Dashingly and Defeats You.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
The Sight of Ahim Saving People Like That <cf>Is Really Cool, I Just Can't Help But Be Feeling.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
But... I'm still a half-baked person who can't use “Vortex Impact”
_
Npc_Striker
Player
... To be honest, it's scary. <cf>I want to run away.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
But that's not the case. <cf>Because Litze is my shampoo...!

Npc_Striker

Come with me to Ritz! <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>I need your help in defeating him!

Npc_Striker

<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>Are you ready to eat it?
_
Npc_Striker
Player
... You're so calm. <cf>I'm... starting to tremble a bit.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
I always wanted to be a hero. <cf>I've been imitating them since I was a kid.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Right now, I have a chance to be a hero. <cf>But I'm more tired than tired.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
I think, I think, I'm going to be the person of my friend, who wants up, Twin Striker and I'm going to the village...
_
Npc_Striker
Player
It must have been so scary and scary...
_
Npc_Striker
Player
What do you think? <cf>Do you think I can really be a hero?
_
Npc_Striker
Player
... No, the answer is fine. <cf>I know
_
Npc_Striker
Player
You have to keep things for yourself!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Every hero has had their talents. <cf>But in the end, he made up his own mind and soul!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
So, I'm ready! <cf>... I'll do it!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>Will be awesome! <cf>AND I WILL PROTECT MY DETERMINATE TOUCH!

So I'll fight, not run away

Npc_Striker
Player
I-I'm getting tired now that I'm here. <cf>Am I going to fight him now...?
_
Npc_Striker
Player
I'm still far from being a hero. <cf>I'm sure I won't be able to be able to keep them in a cool way.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
[--] But so what?!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Did I come here to look cool?! No! <cf>I Came Here to Protect Ritze!

Player
Even if it looks bad, I'll fight! <cf>I'll never run away!

thank you! I owe it to you! <cf>You lose me the strength!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Now Ritze can relax. <cf>Oh, I'm so relieved!!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Oh, sorry. I'm not going to be able to relax if I keep talking like this.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Let's go back to Ritz. <cf>Hehe, it's like a hero's triumph!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>Should not be moved. <cf>Now Ritz can rest easy.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Now, let's return to Ritz! <cf>Is it too much to call it a hero's return? Hahaha!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Good job! <cf>Wow, what a sense of relaxation!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
hehe... It fights me of the battle. <cf>It made me laugh.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
I was swinging the axe around desperation. <cf>I was on the verge of tears.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
There were a few times when I really felt like you were going to kick me away.
_
Npc_Striker
Player
... But. <cf>If you keep fighting like that, you can do it!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
“Vortex Impact”...! <cf>That's amazing! It just came out by chance!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
THIS MEANS I'M A LITTLE CLOSER TO BE A HERO! <cf>I'm a little closer to being a hero!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
Hahaha...! I did it!! <cf>I chose that<value type="enemyName" id="E003_00_00_02001"/>!

This is the first step for hero Manuel!!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
I'm going to practice again! <cf>To make that technique my own!
_
Npc_Striker
Player
I have mastered the use of “Vortex Impact,” and I can now overcome myself...

I'm going to be a great twin striker who is just as good as you!

Npc_Striker

N
Npc_Villager
Player
I RAN INTO THE MOUNTAINS JUST NOW. <cf>You asked me to deliver a message.

N
Npc_Villager

You didn't tell me where you were going
N
Npc_Villager

Whoosh! It's like that sound. <cf>It sounds like the [kaburaya] use that hunters.
N
Npc_Villager
Player
I think it's not too far from the village. <cf>Maybe up on the Eastern Cliffs?
N
Npc_Villager
Player
“<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>”. <cf>Go find it.
N
Npc_Villager
Player
The sound of a [kaburaya] was heard from the top of the cliff, east of the village.
N
Npc_Villager
Player
Maybe it has something to do with this girl named Lili? <cf>She wants to be a bit dangerous, so go and look for her.
N
Npc_Villager
Player
Wow!! So you came! <cf>I'm so glad!!
N
Npc_Archer
Player
You heard the sound of the [Kaburaya], right? <cf>I would love you would have loved!
N
Npc_Archer
Player
The sound of a single arrow is enough to make him realize that I am in danger, and <cf>he can even tell where I am without a word...
N
Npc_Archer
Player
This is the proof of true friendship! <cf>I am so happy by your friendship!!
N
Npc_Archer
Player

N
Npc_Archer
Player
Oh, I see... Yes
N
Npc_Archer

Ahh... But I made a suit.

Npc_Archer

I saw the shadow of the sky Serpent and <cf>I was only looking at the sky
N
Npc_Archer
Player
I didnt realize that it was meant by <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>
N
Npc_Archer

Blast Archer has to be tough because it's hard to get close to him...
N
Npc_Archer
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>, I also lost sight of the <cf>Sky Serpent.
N
Npc_Archer

Npc_Archer
Player
Um, sorry for bothering you. Could you please be careful <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_02_01001"/>?

Npc_Archer
Player
I really want to beat him. <cf>I want to want to avenge my brother!

The Sky Serpent has always been seen at a distance.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
I wish there was a way to get closer clothes...
?
Npc_Archer
Player
|
It's so, so, so tired! It's so exciting!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
I found it! <cf>I finally found it!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
My Brother's Enemy, The Sky Serpent! <cf>I've found his nest!!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
Until now, I've only seen them from afar, but <cf>if it's a nest, I can get closer!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
But they're not stupid. <cf>If they realise they're being pregnant, they'll move their nest.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
If you escape from Montegnor Valley, you<cf>'ll have to start leaving again from scratch.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
I must seize this opportunity at all costs!
?
Npc_Archer
Player

Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>Have formed a flock and are neighboring territories near their nest.

To win the Sky Serpent, you must first kill its minions.

Npc_Archer
Player
So let's proceed step by step.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
First, let's talk. <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> <cf>Don't worry. If we split up, there won't be a problem.

Npc_Archer
Player
Defeating, while I was defeating<value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/>, <cf>'Sky Serpent' defeat.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
It happened they were after this little guy who got lost in the mountains. <cf>I rushed to rescue him.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
I'm sorry, big sister! <cf>Are you hurt?

Npc_girl_common
Npc_Archer
Don't go into the mountains alone. <cf>It's dangerous.

Npc_Archer
Player
And listen! <cf>I ONLY SHOT ONE SHOT, BUT IT HIT HIM!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
At the head of “Sky Serpent”!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
He stumbled a little! <cf>He chose that opportunity to grab the girl and run away.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
Not bad for me, don't you think? <cf>You think so, don't you? I think so!
?
Npc_Archer
Player
Well, the Sky Serpent just escaped. Ahahahahaha!

Npc_Archer
Player
He moved to the direction of “<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>”. <cf>I think he must have loved to his nest.
?
Npc_Archer
Player
You've bought the number of <value type="enemyName" id="E020_00_00_01001"/> minions, and <cf>you're leaving because you've eaten out on some food.

Npc_Archer

D
Npc_Caster
Player
Oh, no. It's not that... <cf>... It's been a long time! Yes, it's been a long time. That's why I was so moved.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
More relaxation, relaxation<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>As you're a spellcaster, I'm sure you know.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
Engram Circulation is the key to spellcaster battles. <cf>When you use a skill, your bioengram is lost.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
If You Run Out Of Engrams, You Can't Fight Wrong. <cf>Remain, you need to recover them from time to time.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
Use a skill. Engrams tablets. <cf>Recover and use a skill again.
D

This circle is the foundation and essence of a spellcaster. <cf>You must never forget this.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Will give you an engram. <cf>I'd like some of it.
D

I'll make the shampoo, so <cf>you just go and hunt them as the shower and come back.

Npc_Caster

Okay, so that's what I thought. There Are <cf>Biomes Infected You.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
Okay, I'll have some of this...
D
Npc_Caster
Player
... That's good. Thank you <cf>But that was a lot quicker than I expected.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
It takes a fair amount of time to master the skills of a spellcaster.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
You've got to have talent as a spellcaster. <cf>Thought you could solve my problem.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
Feeling, I'm in a bit of a relaxed mood. <cf>Right now, I can learn to use my skills.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
The reason is... sorry. I made it public to make it public. <cf>It's not something shady. That's for sure.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME GET OUT OF THIS ISSUES. <cf>Could you help me collect various engrams?
D
Npc_Caster
Player
What I'm leaving to do is a bit tired. <cf>I still need some engram types.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
Spellcasters are a class with a strong connection to natural engrams.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
By using that power to kill monsters, I can finally overcome the engram I desire.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
That's why I wanted a spellcaster to help me. <cf>It was a stroke of luck to meet you.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
However, eating engrams is risky. <cf>You can't imagine on it unless you have the skills.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
I would be happy if you would come back to visit me after you had a little bit and appreciate your skills.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
I will wait forever until you come. <cf>This is the least I can do as a Sarah.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm always in the same place in Asterlies. <cf>When the time comes, call me again.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
It's meant not to be able to use your skills. <cf>I ENVY YOU FOR FIGHTING OUTSIDE.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
However, you can learn a lot just by leaving people on the street.
D
Npc_Caster
Player
Adventurers have been busy busy. <cf>It seems like the number of monsters has monsters.

This might be a good time to gain some experience as a spellcaster.

I, Sarah, will need many more engrams to return my body to normal.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
This time we need the “Nimrite Ore” that is supposed to be in the Asteria Plains.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
It's a very fragile stone that breaks damaged and has few uses. <cf>It was hard to get hold of in this town, so we were having trouble.

Npc_Caster

I also need the engram of. <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> <cf>I'd like you to lose this one later.

I've heard that “Nimlite Ore” could have been found around Minsterhorn.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm thinking of thinking about the soil there. <cf>Could you please escort me?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Please take me, Sarah, to the Minsterhorn. Thank you
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Can you escort me to the Minsterhorn?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
The SOIL FOUND NEARBY CONTAINS THE ENGRAMS I, Sara, NEED.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
We've got excited. Thank you very much. <cf>I Wonder If I Can Check The Soil Here Without Being Seen By Scissors
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I don't want to stand out too much. <cf>Now, let's see...
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Yes... It contains “Nimlite ore”. <cf>There's no going that it's stopping nearby.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
How do I know?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
You see the engrams, not the soil stains. <cf>You might as well say you feel them.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Just like living things, inorganic matter such as ores also contains engrams.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Have you ever been scared that your bio-engram had been tired? <cf>
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Even if you do nothing, the Engrams contains in the natural environment cleansing seep into your body.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
This is how we apply it to teenagers between engrams. <cf>As a Sarah, I am extremely sensitive to this.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Oops, sorry. That was just a little bit of trivia. <cf>I have a bad habit of talking too much.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Back to the main topic. Grams, the engrams contained in the soil are not enough.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I need the “Nimlite Ore” shampoo. <cf>Can you collect it for me?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I'll prepare the engram massage procedure. <cf>When you have the numbers, come back here.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Can You Collect the “Nimlite Ore”?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
You should be able to find it in Minster Hills. <cf>Just look around the village and you'll be fine.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Welcome back. <cf>You've bought the “Nimlite Ore” for us.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
That's right. It didn't work with other lands. <cf>It requires some really serious engram jokes.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
There is still a long way to go, and more materials are needed. <cf>Will the day come when is everything ready?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I can't afford to take too much time. <cf>If this feels up, she'll...
\
Npc_Caster
Player
... No, there is no point in being weak-wrought. <cf>I have no choice but to move forward, one step at a time.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
There's One More Thing I'd Like to Ask You. <cf>Yes It's an engram for <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
\
Npc_Caster
Player
As snacks in the first request, I want you to eat <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and collect the engrams.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
They are cunning and dancing. <cf>But if you learn how to fight them, you don't have to be scared.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Don't Just Attack Blindly, Change Your Aim According to the Decisions.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Stay calm even during a successful stay. <cf>It's a good idea to be aware of how to use engrams.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Oh no. That's a long story. <cf>As Sarah, I find myself doing this all the time.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Don't worry. I believe in your strength. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Delight and come back again.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Could you please explain <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>the thought in '<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>'?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Come back when you're done. <cf>I'd like to use the engram that clings to you
\
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>It got the subjugation went the hell. <cf>Thank you And I'm glad you're safe.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Then let me extract the bioengram that clings to you.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
... Thank you for wanting me this far. <cf>Let me tell you more about my “troublesome trouble.”
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Sadly, I'm not Sarah pregnant. I'm an Imaginee that she's summoned.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
For some reason, I'm obsessed with her body and can't let go.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
What's More, My Thoughts Is Winning and <cf>Sarah Can't Even Speak.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I didn't do it on purpose. <cf>I want Sarah back.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
For this purpose, a special occasion is meant. <cf>And then, the relaxation engrams are teenagers.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
It's not something I can reveal to just tell, so I can't just ask someone for help.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Sarah is very helpful for your help. <cf>She can talk to me.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Sarah also wanted to tell you the truth. She said, “I can trust you.”
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Sarah is also an excellent spellcaster. <cf>I Wonder If There Is Something About You That Feeling You Together?
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Thats the Thoughts, That's the Thoughts. <cf>Both my engrams are messed up, and I can't use my skills.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
So, I think I'll have to worry on you from now on. <cf>Please, please be kind to me.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm back in Asterlies again. <cf>If you see me, I'd be happy if you'd say hello.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Not to save me, Sarah, but Sarah saved. <cf>Please lend me your strength.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I truly believe your kindness. <cf>That's all I can ask of you as Sarah for now.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I think it will be some time before you change the destiny of Sarah and me, Sarah.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
Until then, let's wait while synthesizing engrams.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm not a board THIS TOWN IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN I WAS ALIVE.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
The Utilisation of Heritage Sites and Occupational Advances are thriving. <cf>I'm washing that water supply and sewerage systems have been drinking.
\
Npc_Caster
Player
I was so upset that I splashed it around and <cf>Sara got angry at me.

<cf>It looks like you're growing steadily as a spell caster
K
Npc_Caster
Player
You should also pay attention to weapons. <cf>You should use what's right for your abilities
K
Npc_Caster
Player
E
hey, you? <cf>I'll always take care of you. thanks
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>In order to return her body to Sarah, I have to go look for Engram this time too
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>We need an engram that can be extracted from a plant called “[jogenka (jogenka)]”
K
Npc_Caster
Player
However, “[Jogenka (Jogenka)]” is extremely rare. You can't get it <cf>even at Asterlize
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>I was in trouble, but... I remember only having one idea
K
Npc_Caster
Player
It's a story about when I, as Sara, was still alive
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>“[Jogenka (Jogenka)]” was offered to the tombstone of a great person
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>I packed the dried flowers in a bottle, so if you're lucky, there should still be some left
K
Npc_Caster
Player
The amount of engram needed is only a small amount. If you <cf>find even just a tiny fragment, that's fine
K
Npc_Caster
Player
However, the destination is the Bahama Mar Plateau
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>I'm a Sarah who can't use my skills satisfactorily, so I really can't go alone
K
Npc_Caster
Player
On top of that, we also need an <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/> engram. <cf>After all, I have no choice but to ask for your cooperation
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's go to Lalpal first. Along the way, I want you to defeat it with <cf>“” <value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>We're in Lalpal, so I wonder if they'll let me know when they've finished defeating the Horngoats
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Is the <value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/> subjugation of “<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>” over?
K
Npc_Caster
Player
When you're done, come over to Lalpal. <cf>We'll go ahead, so I asked
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E004_00_00_01001"/>It looks like they were subdued
K
Npc_Caster
Player
thank you. <cf>Well, I'll get the engram left in your body
K
Npc_Caster
Player
OK. <cf>The place I'm heading to now is a place associated with Emmeline, the founder of spellcaster
K
Npc_Caster
Player
She was born in a small village in Barnhardt territory
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>It seems that when that village was attacked by dragons, they used fire and blizzard to repel them
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>Emmelain's engram manipulation was extremely [precise (precise)], and it is said that they hoped and caused various natural phenomena
K
Npc_Caster
Player
[--] Yes. <cf>This is the prototype of Spellcaster's skill
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Emmeline is “The First Spellcaster.” However<cf>, he is also a person who is on a fine line with legends
K
Npc_Caster
Player
After all, they are people who lived in the old days. <cf>Detailed figures and achievements are unclear
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>However, it is true that she has explored things throughout her life and traveled all over the world
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>I respect that attitude, and spell casters value an inquisitive mind
K
Npc_Caster
Player
... well, the conversation got off
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>What I, as Sara, visited when I was alive was Emmeline's tombstone, no matter what to hide
K
Npc_Caster
Player
She sleeps in “Calm Mountain.” Take me that far as <cf>Sara
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Emmeline's tombstone is in the “Calm Mountain Foothills.” Take me away who is <cf>Sara
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Oh, I'm nostalgic... <cf>Emmeline's grave marker is here
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Huh, it's a face that only looks like a rock
K
Npc_Caster
Player
That's right. This is just a rock. <cf>There's no point in it, and it's not a special place
K
Npc_Caster
Player
That's why it makes sense, but... well, don't do it. <cf>Let's say we fulfill our purpose first
K
Npc_Caster
Player
... oh, that was great. The bottle I offered, which is <cf>Sara, was left
K
Npc_Caster
Player
“[Jogen Hana (Yogenka)]” also remains. <cf>Now I can get the engram needed for the ceremony again
K
Npc_Caster
Player
thank you. It's all thanks to you this time
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>But instead, it took away one of your pleasures
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>Searching for Emmeline's tombstone is one of Spellcaster's quest tasks
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Emmeline used this simple rock as her grave marker
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>I dared not leave a mark and tried to make a backward spell caster find it
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>If you collect hints left in books, ruins, and anecdotes, you can now understand this place
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>There must be people among modern spell casters looking for Emmeline's grave marker
K
Npc_Caster
Player
So I wonder if they'll keep this a secret
K
Npc_Caster
Player
don't worry. There must be another <cf>bigger “exploration” theme for you
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Yes [--] the more “exploration” that transcends time
K
Npc_Caster
Player
Now, let's say I'm Sarah and I go home. I have to proceed with preparations for the <cf>ceremony
K
Npc_Caster
Player
We need a little more engram. <cf>Also, I'll ask for your support. Well then
K
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>As Sara and Sara, I talk about a lot of things in my heart
K
Npc_Caster
Player
history, old friends, etc... I wonder if your <cf>story comes up a lot these days
K
Npc_Caster
Player
[PATH]317*\Scenario\CAV104_004.uasset[PATH]
Spellcasters present the truth and facts, and have a spirit of “exploration” to solve mysteries.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Have you found the theme of your “exploration”? <cf>I'm sure a big, mysterious mystery awaits you
e
Npc_Caster
Player
_
Hello. I'm the <cf>Imaginee Possessed by Sara the Spellcaster.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Oh dear. <cf>The introduction is getting more and more tired.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I have to give this body back to Sarah soon, or I'll bite my tongue.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
In order to protect my tongue as Sara, I will search for the engram shampoo for the tongue
e
Npc_Caster
Player
This time I want to collect my <cf>biome engrams as Sarah.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I found two tools that were used by him in life.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
But they're both dens of monsters. <cf>I need your help.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
One is the tent pole at <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>in '<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>'
e
Npc_Caster
Player
... You have a strange look on your face. <cf>Of course, it's not just a pillar.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
The thing you're looking for is the wand I used when I was alive.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>The pattern on the pillar shampoo
e
Npc_Caster
Player
It was meant used as material to build a tent.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
It can't be used as a weapon, but <cf>my bio-engram should still be faintly present.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I want you to crush the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I'll thank you. <cf>I won't be of much help in the fight anyway.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
<cf>While you're distracting the<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>, we should be able to retrieve the engram from the staff.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's head to “<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>” for now. <cf>We'll figure out the details there.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
THE WALKING STICK I USED TOGETHER TO BE LEFT BEHIND IN <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>
e
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>'s tent pole... <cf>I want to get my engram from that staff.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's head to “<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>” for now. <cf>I'd like to make detailed plans there. Thank you
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Hmm... Speaking of “<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>“, it was known for having the ruins of <cf>Bafarian relaxation around...
e
Npc_Caster
Player
It seems like there are more monsters than when I hate them. <cf>Adventurers and Adventurers used to visit here often.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Destroying the Ruins is going to be a struggle. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>Are you roaming around like they own the place...
e
Npc_Caster
Player
... Oh, sorry. <cf>Whenever I come across something, I immediately start thinking about it.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's focus on the sticks used for the tent for now. <cf>It looks like it's in the woods.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
If I hide in the trees, I can get close. <cf>You need to attract the attention of the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> as much as possible.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Well, if you just wanted them without thinking too much about it, that's fine. <cf>I'll do my best.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
If everything goes well, let's meet here again. <cf>Then, let's start the operation.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I want you to be <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> around here. <cf>That will attract their attention.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
While, I'll sneak into the camp and retrieve the engrams.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
When you finish your hunt, I should be able to come back. <cf>Let's meet up here again later.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Good job. Thank you <cf>You've managed to attract the <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Thanks to you, I was able to retrieve the bioengram from the staff.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Why is my staff, Sara, in the village of<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>... you may be tired.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>and Mooks that perform engram noodles like spellcasters?
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Where did they develop their technology? <cf>And how do they pass it on?
e
Npc_Caster
Player
So there's a class like a spellcaster... <cf>That was my “quest” before I started.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
That's why I also visited the Thoughts of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
e
Npc_Caster
Player
My own memory of that time is vague. <cf>I was passing by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> during the ceremony.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
That's why the wand was left behind.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Don't worry. <cf>That was yesterday of years ago.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Well, I hope the staff engram will be enough, but <cf>it doesn't work to work that well.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I have to find another one of my belongings too
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Do you know a place called Bergmar? <cf>I'm going around there for a time.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
There's no way there's a house left, but there must be some trace of it left.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's follow the same flow. <cf>First, let's go to <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/> 'and see what's going on.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I hear that Bergmar is a more dangerous place than this. <cf>I need your help once again.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
There must be some remnants of the time when I feel in a place called Bergkmar.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I heard that I'm in a different state now... <cf>I'm sure they can find at least a fragment of my bioengram.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I want to collect that too. <cf>First, let's go to <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/> 'and see what's going on.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
[--] It used to be a quiet area, just like the name “<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>” relaxation.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
The Number of Noisy Monsters has tired without us even dying it. <cf>No, maybe that's not the only reason?
e
Npc_Caster
Player
It's shampoo sinister... I sense a strange presence lingering within.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
It's quite possible that the monsters are becoming more aggressive due to the presence of that presence.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
It's a deep-seated problem. I feel like it will have some impact on your adventures and your quest.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm curious about the truth of that, but let's leave it for now. <cf>My priority as Sarah is to take care of my business.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
As attractive, I want you to attract the monsters while I collect the bio-engrams.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
This time it will take more than before. <cf>Maybe someone will notice the moving Engrams.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>Are you particularly sensitive to changes in engrams. <cf>If they get in your way, it can be a real pain.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>Could you please explain it? <cf>Please try to go on a rampage as spectacularly as possible.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I'll hide in its shadows. <cf>When you're done, each of you can come back here.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Please explain the <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_02_00_01001"/>that is nesting in '' <value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I want a chance to retrieve the bioengram. <cf>If I kill a few of them, they'll go away.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
When you're done, come back here.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Welcome back. <cf>Everything went well. Thanks to you
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Thank you very much. <cf>This is enough for my bioengram as Sarah.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
[--] It feels like me a little of the past.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I, Sarah, was also a spellcaster before I imagined an imaginee.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
My name is Slaft. <cf>I thought I had done some good for people... but you may not know.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
In any case, they say a long time ago. <cf>IT'S NOT RIGHT TO TAKE THE BODY OF SOMEONE WHO IS STILL ALIVE.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Being able to know about the future World as an Imaginee is strange, but it can be said to be a distorted event.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
... THE NEXT TIME I ASK YOU FOR SOMETHING, I WILL BE READY TO RELEASE SARAH.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Has I, Sarah, been able to leave you with something?
e
Npc_Caster
Player
Sadly, this is the last one. <cf>Please, I beg you.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I am Sarah, and my real name is Slaft.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
I guess I'm just one step away from returning this body to Sarah.
e
Npc_Caster
Player
We can't afford to make any shampoo. <cf>We have to be tired...
e
Npc_Caster
Player
[PATH]444*\Scenario\Cav104_005.uasset[PATH]
I am Sarah, Slaft. <cf>I think it's about time to call myself that.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
The time to return this body to Sarah is tired... <cf>I have a feeling that
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Hi. <cf>I think I can finally give Sarah back to me.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Or rather... there is no more time. <cf>I must erase and erase the me that is Sarah.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Sarah has been not busy to my calls more and more. <cf>It feels like her shampoo is fading.
?
Npc_Caster
Player

I Will Now Perform the Cleanse to Erase Me, Sarah.

The Last Engram You Need Is The One Contained in <cf>Mayamal Ore
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I chose for it in the city, but it wasn't for sale. <cf>Maybe it's because it's an ore that doesn't have any unnecessary value or power.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm the only one who needs this. <cf>And it's just for a relaxing shower.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I want to relax up and prepare for the shampoo. <cf>Could you please collect the “Mayayar Ore” in the shampoo?
?
Npc_Caster
Player
“<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>” Can be found here. <cf>Come back here when you're done.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
'<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>' <cf>Please collect 'Mayayar Ore'
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm here for the musicians. <cf>It's Almost Time to Erase Me, Sarah.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
You loved me the Mayamar mine. <cf>Thank you Now, it's time.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Sarah would be happy too. <cf>... Sarah? Sarah?
?
Npc_Caster
Player
No reply... This is bad. <cf>I'm tired pregnant.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
We don't have time. Let's relax.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
THE ENGRAMS YOU HAVE BEEN SOFAR HAVE BEEN CRYSTALLIZED AND STUNNING INTO A SPECIAL MIRROR.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I need to see myself in this. <cf>That means someone has to hold it.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Somebody Knows My Wife as Sarah and Can Be Trusted
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Now, let's save the girl from the ghosts of the past.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Here, you'll stand out no matter what, and there will be too many people, disrupting the flow of engrams.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
There is a suitable place for this sweater. <cf>Let's head to Montegnor Valley.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
There's no problem in the “Mellisos River Basin”. <cf>Please protect me, Sarah.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
The “Melisos River Basin” in the Monte Nor Valley. <cf>Perform the trick there.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
We should be able to save Sara. <cf>We're running out of time. Let's relax.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Arrival. <cf>This is the place to erase me, Sarah.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
When I think about it, it was a long journey
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Yes... there is a strong flow of natural engrams. <cf>The conditions here are perfect.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I was tired out of Sara and pursed <cf>into tired engrams.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
And it will flow into this flow. <cf>It's like scattering ashes in a river.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
When That Feeling, Maybe I'll Know Everything About The World.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
A great moment for a spellcaster
?
Npc_Caster
Player
... I thought so. <cf>It feels like something is getting in the way at the very end.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Is this... a pack of Mook Warriors? <cf>Their bio-engrams are disrupting the flow.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
What a bunch of people. <cf>You don't need to hang out in a place like this.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
If My Engrams Don't Flow Rains, I'm in Danger of Returning to Sarah's Body.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I don't have time to collect engrams from scratch again. <cf>I have to get it right the first time.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
[--] It's unavoidable. <cf>There is no choice but to resort to force here.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Drowsy... I can't say that, but <cf>I'm now able to use the skill.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's work together and get the Mook Warriors to Retreat.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
A Swarm of Mook Warriors is disrupting the conflict. <cf>Let's keep them busy.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
There must be a place where they hang out in a corner of the Melissos River Basin.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Stuck Sarah, we'd be better off. <cf>Let's go.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
It helps to be here. <cf>The Footprints of the Mook Warriors are here.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Hmm, the engram is strong. <cf>If This Is Not Released, It Will Be Released with the Releases.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
And... there's some loot going around. <cf>A pack that has harm to attack danger is dangerous.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Should we ask you to leave early?
?
Npc_Caster
Player
...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
... Oh, sorry. <cf>It's not the time for that, but I got sentimental.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
This is the last time I can fight against you.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
What a strange coquette. <cf>I NEVER THOUGHT THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN I WOULD FIGHT MY JUNIORS WHO ARE DYING OF YEARS YOUNIOR THAN ME
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Seeing an excellent spellcaster up close, I felt that the future was pretty bright.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
It would be an honor for someone like me to have had some pleasure in the foundation of this era.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
This is a boring parting gift, but please remember this Battle of Slaft in the Exposition.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's get started!
?
Npc_Caster
Player
[--] It's over. <cf>Yes, the Flow of Engrams has calmed down.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
That was a great job. Thank you <cf>IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU FOR SATISFACTION ME OUT.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Hmm... the elation after death a battle. <cf>I feel a little sad to see this end.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
No, this is no time to be so sad. <cf>Sarah has come to come first.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Let's go back to where we were. <cf>This time, we should be able to perform the trouble without any problems.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm going to lose you just a little joke. <cf>Please feel free to me.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Do you remember the location of the temples? <cf>Let's go back there
?
Npc_Caster
Player
This time there will be no problems. <cf>I will be able to give Sarah back her body.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
That's what we've come so far for. <cf>We must never lose sight of our original purpose.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
You're back. <cf>Now, please spare me any more trouble...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
There are no problems with the climate or engrams. <cf>It doesn't kill like monsters will kill you.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I've got all the tools, so I think I'm finally ready.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
[--] Now, let's begin erasing me.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Please hold the mirror that I, Sarah, made and stand in front of it. That's all I need.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
The rest is for me to cast the engram. <cf>The Mirror Illuminates It and Illuminates Me, Sarah.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Along the way, the materials you will come into play and <cf>will turn into a force that punch me away from Sara.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'd like to explain it in detail, but [--] <cf>no matter how much time we have, it won't be enough.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
The Final Skill of “Expert” Slaft.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I guess this is the last time I'll call myself Sarah. <cf>Thank you for being with me for so long.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
You Will Be a Good Spellcaster <cf>I hope you will be friends with Sarah for a long time.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
It was nice meeting you. <cf>Good-bye. It was fun. [--]
?
Npc_Caster
Player
... Hmm... Uh...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Ah, can you speak...? My body... can move! <cf>Mr. Slaft! Mr. Slaft! ?
?
Npc_Caster
Player
... So he really is gone
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>Um, can we talk at that place?
?
Npc_Caster
Player
That place in Asterlies... <cf>There where I always explain,
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I used SLAFT's Imaginee there.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Please let me tell you about Mr. Slaft in that place. <cf>It's a special place for me...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Can I talk to you in Asterlies, where I've always been?
?
Npc_Caster
Player
This is a special place for me and Mr. Slaft.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Ahhhh... <cf>My Legs Are Wobbly~
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Um, over there is the sea... <cf>Ah, I'm finally getting used to moving my eyes.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm back...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Nice to meet you again. <cf>I'm Sarah, a spellcaster.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I've seen you and heard your voice for a long time. <cf>Thank you so much for everything you've done for me.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I used SLAFT's Imaginee here, and we ended up swapping places.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Since then, I've been talking about various things with Mr. Slaft.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I had almost been given up, but <cf>Slaft was always motivated to me.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
And for always relaxing me
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'm glad we were able to go back to normal. <cf>But it's lonely without Slaft...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I can't even say goodbye sorry...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
... Huh? In My Pocket... Ah!
?
Npc_Caster
Player
This is Slaft's Imaginee Seed...!
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I see... So you're excited...
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Adventurer, I'll try to find a way to call Mr. Slaft sorry again.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Until now, I have not had a theme of “exploration” as a spellcaster.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
But you and Mr. Slaft brought <cf>it to us!
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Please keep the shampoo. <cf>I will be a great spellcaster.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I'll Work Hard to Improve My Skills and “Exploration” So That I Can Struggle with You!
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Hello! <cf>I'm Sarah, a spellcaster.
?
Npc_Caster
Player
Imaginee is a lot to think about. <cf>I have to study more and more!
?
Npc_Caster
Player
I think I'll go to the Imaginee Laboratory. <cf>It's a bit strange, but I hear there are some excellent people there...

Hey, good work! <cf>It looks like the Minsterhorn kid isn't here.
L
Npc_Smasher
Player
I didn't see you on the way here either... <cf>Where did you get lost?
L
Npc_Smasher

I had a similar experience a long time ago.

I got lost in the forest and was lost by a monster. <cf>The Person Who Took Me Was My Master.

It doesn't happen to be in Asteria Plain, so <cf>I guess it's time to look for other places.
L
Npc_Smasher
Player
I'd like to say you to my master, so please call me again if you like. See you!

Npc_Smasher

I'll be going around looking for my master, but I'm planning on leaving in Asterlies.

Well, Master. <cf>Where is he going...?

I might find myself coming to Asterlies. <cf>I can't leave here.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I
Hey! <cf>Sorry to say you again.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
A little while ago, I went to Lalpal in search of my master.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
At that time, listen to the sad story
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
It bought that the food and luggage we had stored there were ransacked by someone...
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
It's similar to a request I was prepared in before.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
To be precise, it's a request that my master received.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
When I was still a young man, <cf>we went to Lalpal together.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
... It's a bitter memory. <cf>I messed up and lost trouble for my master.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
The Culprit of the Luggage Theft at That Time Was a Monster
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
If this is dangerous again, the people in the city are in danger. <cf>I want to look into it because I'm curious.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I'd like to have some help if possible. <cf>If you could come, that would be great!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Let's go to Lalpal first and gather clues.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Talk to people in the city, check out luggage storage areas... <cf>Once You've Been Asking All the Information, Meet Up Again at the Location!

Let's go to Lalpal and gather some clues about who raided our luggage.

O
Npc_Resident_Larpal

Oh, was your luggage stolen?
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
Of course I do. <cf>And I saw it that night!
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
A herd of the Beasts ran through the town!
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
I saw many eyes shining in the darkness, and I heard growls.
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
Oh, I was so excited! <cf>I was dying they would find me and bite me.
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
What kind of beast was it? Well...
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
They had four legs... they loved like wolves. <cf>They were small and agile.
O
Npc_Resident_Larpal
Player
There are many sharp toilets around the luggage storage area
O

Like clothes made by claws or fangs

Hey, how's it going? <cf>Have you found any clues about the luggage theft?
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Hmmmm... <cf>I saw a herd of beasts, people, and spirits from claws and fangs?
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I also found Monster Hair and Footprints
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Trying the Clues... <cf>The One Who Robbed The Luggage was <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
It was the same with me and my master.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
They hunt in packs and are smart. <cf>They know where to put their food.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I chased him away then, but he came back again.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
That's some guts!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
All the right! Let's finish it off. <cf>Let's have fun! <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
We have to teach them that they're scared. <cf>If we do that, they won't even come near Ralpal.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I might be underhanded if we do it in just one place, so <cf>let's go and cause trouble in two places, you and I!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Let's target the guys in “<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>”. <cf>They'll make it to Lalpal.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Meet me here when you're done. <cf>Well then, let's get started!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Let's split up and throw! <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/> <cf>Don't leave ``<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>“, okay?
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Let's meet up here when we're done. <cf>This should be quiet things down in Lalpal.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Hey, good job! Looks like you've finished defeating <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
All the right. <cf>If we just do this, we should be fine.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I'm glad it ended I'm happy <cf>Thanks to your help.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
A long time ago, I felt <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>just like my master...
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
There was one guy who was really tough. <cf>He ended up cornering me.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
If My Master didn't kill me, I would have been in serious danger. <cf>By the Way, My Master was so cool at that time!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
... Oh, no. <cf>That's not what I wanted to talk about.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
I was so tired. <cf>I was holding my masterback...
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
So I'm really glad that things went well today! <cf>I feel like I've grown since then.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
thank you! <cf>When I Find My Master, I'll Love Brag About You!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
That's why I need to find it difficult. <cf>Okay! I'll go look for it again!
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
When You Saved Me, You Were So Cool.
O
Npc_Smasher
Player
Like this, it's crazy with a bang, and then with a bang, it blows the monster away...

I was mesmerized... <cf>Oh my, where did he go?

The same thing happened again.
J

At that time, I was almost always by a really strong monster.

It had Blue Fur and was much faster, smarter and smarter than the others.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
That's “Sapphire Trot”
J

I didn't see you when I went with you. <cf>But I guess you were just tired.

This makes the people of Lalpal feel uneasy. <cf>I can't make my clients smile!
J
Npc_Smasher

Plus, I have some old clothes to pay.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I Want to Succeed the “Sapphire Trot.” <cf>PLEASE. Lend me your strength!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Someone must have seen him in Lalpal. <cf>Let's hear his story.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
There must be someone in Ralpal who has seen “Sapphire Trot”
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I've got to get him this time! <cf>Let's start by gathering information on him.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Have You Not Seen “Sapphire Trot”?
J
Npc_guard_common
Player
Oh, you're talking about the luggage theft. <cf>We received a report about it too.
J
Npc_guard_common
Player
["I saw a blue wolf"]
J
Npc_guard_common
Player
It feels to be a very beautiful and intelligent monster. <cf>It is said to be well known among the locals.
J
Npc_guard_common
Player
Are you looking for it too? <cf>Then look for “God's Desperate Hill”
J
Npc_guard_common
Player
It seems like they claim that area as their territory. <cf>But it seems like it would be hard to find them.
J
Npc_guard_common
Player
We haven't found it yet. The <cf>It Doesn"t Show Remains Incurable in Public.
J

'Sapphire Trot'...? <cf>Yes, I know it.
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
I've seen it a few times, but from a distance.
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
It has blue fur and is very beautiful. <cf>It looks quiet but...
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
In reality, it's a much worse and more dangerous monster than <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
DON'T BE FOOLED BY FOOLED BY FOOLED. <cf>I always tell my kids that.
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
Where do you live? Hmm, I can't really go into details...
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
But I saw him near the city. <cf>Maybe he's happy in “God's Hill”
J
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
Hey! <cf>Have You Said Any Information on “Sapphire Trot”?
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
It looks like he's the real culprit behind the luggage theft after all.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
What a good escape. <cf>Damn it! It won't be that way this time!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
But the most important thing is where he is. <cf>Where is he tired...?
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Eh? You got it?!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Thoughts in “God's Watchful Hill”... <cf>Great job! You're amazing!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Okay, then it's easy.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
It's right, right? You and I Will Blow Away the Sapphire Trot!!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
That guy leads the pack. <cf>If you kill the leader, the others will be scatter.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
You'll never try to attack Ralpal again.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
This time I'll make the people of Ralpal smile. <cf>And I'll pay back all my old clothes at once!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Let's go! To the Lair of “Sapphire Trot”!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
It feels like “Sapphire Trot” is making his home shampoo in “God's Watchful Hill”
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Once you say that, it's simple. <cf>Come on, let's go and blow some shit away together!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
If we solve him, this case will be solved!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Okay, this is it... I caught a glimpse of it. <cf>The Blue Shadow of “Sapphire Trot”
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Oops, my hands are shaking. <cf>What's that? I'm shaking like a horse. That's not like me.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Hehe, to tell you the truth. <cf>I'm a little teenager about it.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I was pregnant last time. <cf>I never thought I'd get revenge like this.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
How much trouble have I become since then? <cf>This is the perfect place to find out!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
This time, don't hide behind your master's back. <cf>YOU'LL BE FIGHTING SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUR FRIENDS!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Alright, I'm excited up! <cf>Are you ready?
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
“Sapphire Trot”! <cf>We'll make you shampoo make us your shampoo!!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Yeeeesssssss!! <cf>Did you see that, you bastard!!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Wow, I did it! <cf>I chose that 'Sapphire Trot'!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Thanks for your help!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_01_01001"/>Also ran away. <cf>This is the end of the pack.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I don't have the wisdom or the college to nourish food from places where people live.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Now, let's go back to Ralpal and tell everyone.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
It feels good to be able to go home with my head held high! <cf>I'll tell you all about your heroic deeds!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
IT WAS THANKS TO YOU COMING WITH ME THAT I WAS ABLE TO SURPRISE THE SAPPHIRE TROT.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Thanks! <cf>Now, let's go back to Ralpal and tell everyone!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Hey, good job! <cf>This time you really wanted me out. Thank you
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Everyone was so busy. <cf>They said they were happy that a reliable adventurer had come.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I wish you'd make me a little too
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Haha, just kidding! <cf>Thanks to you, I was able to get a weight off my chest too.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I've always been bothered by the fact that I held my masterback.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
'Sapphire Trot' had done whatever it wanted, and it seemed like it was going to happen again this time.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
But I finally finished it all.
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
And best of all. <cf>THE PEOPLE OF LALPAL CAN NOW REST EASY!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Your luggage won't be ransacked and you won't have to worry about the Sapphire Trot!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
If you think about it like that, it's like you and I have finished up some loose ends that Master left undone!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Hehe, this is great! <cf>I NOW HAVE A STORY TO TELL MY MASTER ABOUT MY MASTER!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
All the right! Just hang on, master! <cf>I'll find you right away!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
Let's Brag about it together! <cf>There's something wrong with that incident that you don't know about!
J
Npc_Smasher
Player
I've met a lot of heavy smashers, but <cf>you're a little special.
J

If You Stab, You Will Be Given Another “Stronger”! And stab!
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
Thought this is the basic strategy of the Blitz Lancer.
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
It's pretty simple, right? <cf>But it's very deep.
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
Okay! Let's put it into practice. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>Let's try using ``Imprint” on the motivation!
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'll go and say they're too tired. <cf>IT'S NOT GOOD TO LEAVE IT TO MY JUNIORS ALONE!
:
Npc_Lancer

When we're done, let's meet here again!
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
Dressed <value type="locationName" id="fld001_S"/> at<value type="enemyName" id="E005_00_00_01001"/>! <cf>Try using Blitz Lancer's skills too.

:
Npc_Lancer
Player
You're... a junior of Blitz Lancer, right? <cf>really?
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
I can't do it that well at first. <cf>Even teenagers my senior teenagers me.
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
huh...? I'm a senior, so I don't need this...?
:
Npc_Lancer
Player
No! No, no, you still have a long way to go! <cf>The Road to Becoming a Blitz Lancer is Long and Stunning!
:
Npc_Lancer

As a senior, I have to be able to guide my juniors. Yes!

Thank you for today! <cf>I'll Teach You About Blitz Lancer Next Time

[PATH]205*\Scenario\Cav106_002.uasset[PATH]
I wonder what I should teach you next...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
IT'S BORING JUST TO KEEP FIGHTING, SO I WANT TO COME UP WITH SOME WAY TO KEEP IT TOGETHING.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
C
Hey! How are you? <cf>Have you loved as a Blitz Lancer?
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
I STILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO TEACH YOU...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Just Fighting Monsters is Boring. <cf>I was board too, so I was tired.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
So this time I accepted the request from the Reclamation Bureau.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
While we're taking care of this, let's practice Blitz Lancer!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Of course, I'll pay you. <cf>I'm not going to do something like that, senpai, to myself!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
THE REQUEST IS TO COLLECT “RED AND BLUE VIOLETS” AT <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
However, it explains that there is a <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>around where the 'Red and Blue Violets' grow.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
It would be a pain to request “Red and Blue Violets” from the <cf>Reclamation Bureau every time you need them, right?
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
So let's get rid of <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Well then, let's head to! <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/> <cf>Meet us at Minsterhorn!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
A request from the Reclamation Bureau and Blitz Lancer practice. <cf>Don't you think it would be more efficient if we could do it together?
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Well then, let's meet at the Minsterhorn first.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Okay, here we go. <cf>Well, let's start by wearing the “Red and Blue Violets”.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
This is a request from the Bureau of Reclamation. <cf>I have to remember that.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
In the mood, I'll go and check on<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>You, the senior, have to take the lead when it comes to dangerous accidents!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
You Don't Have to Worry About It, Just Collect the “Red and Blue Violets”
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>, but don't push yourself. <cf>I'll teach you how to fight fights later.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
When You've Finished Finished Them, Come Back Here!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>. <cf>It's a request from the Reclamation Bureau, so don't forget to do it.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'll go and check on <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/> in the shower. <cf>When you're done leaving them, come back here.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Hey, good job! <cf>Did you find the “Red and Blue Violets”?
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's see... <cf>Yup, looks like we have all the numbers. thank you!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
I am also brought into <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
There were quite a few of them. Soon we might be getting closer to the Minsterhorn.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's reduce the number before that trouble.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>I Remember Before That Blitz Lancer Can Grant “Engraved” Right?
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
This is how Blitz Lancer handled things at that time.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
When you attack, it's important to immediately distance yourself. <cf>If you try to attack too many times, you will hate.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Don't rush, just take one hit at a time. <cf>It's dangerous if you're dying by other monsters.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Someone with experience has more motivational power. <cf>... Yeah. It was really bad back then...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>May live in groups, but <cf>avoid taking on the whole group.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Try fighting as if you were fighting one-on-one multiple times.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
All the right! Let's go and celebrate! <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's split up and chase them away! <cf>When we're done, we'll meet at the surprising spot in Asterlies.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>Let's use Blitz Lancer's relaxation to relaxation! <value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's split up and chase them away. <cf>When We're Done, Meet at the Stunning Place in Asterlies!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Wow! HAVE YOU FINISHED THE HUNT YET?
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Ehhh... I'm really hard and <cf>finished it just in time...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
The first time I felt<value type="enemyName" id="E000_00_00_01001"/>, it scared me much, and I even had to get help from my senior...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Damn, that's nice... <cf>I envy you for being strong... sniff...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
ha! I'm not worried! I'm not worried! <cf>Senpai Don't Cry!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
... But I'm really excited. <cf>You're a junior, but you're so cool!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Me. There is someone I look up to, like a master.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
I was indebted to a senior Blitz Lancer, and <cf>he was also a senior adventurer.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Someday, I want to be a strong and reliable senior like him.
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
Slightly, you're a little different from the junior I Imagineed you to be...
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
But that doesn't change the fact that I'm your senior!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'll Train Harder so I don't lose to you, my junior! <cf>I'd like you to help me again, so please help me next time!
I
Npc_Lancer
Player

Once you get used to the Blitz Lancer, you should also pay attention to your emotions.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Using a weapon that suits you is also part of your skill. <cf>Oh, I'm sounding like a senior!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
S
Uh huh... <cf>Sorry for something so sorry
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I accepted two requests at once
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
The request is to collect a plant called “Roadside Star Grass” and snacks <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Both are done on the Bahamar Valley, but <cf>I don't have enough people to do it alone...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm sorry! <cf>Please think of me as a senior and help me out!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Ralpal, it said that my senior is coming to Ralpal. <cf>Look, it's the senior who got me out, as I married before.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I wanted to show you my best side, so I ended up taking on too many requests...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'll ask you to collect the “Roadside Star Grass”. I'll be happy <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
You're My Senior After All! LEAVE THE DANGEROUS STUFF TO ME!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Maybe you'll finish more than me, so <cf>when you get together, can you come over to my place?
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
It's in '<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>' in the Bahamar Valley. <cf>You should also be able to find 'Roadside Star Grass' there.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Nice to meet you! See you later!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Collect the “Roadside Star Grass” from “<value type="locationName" id="fld002_S"/>” in the Bahamar Valley.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm hunting<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>, so <cf>come over to me when you're done
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Ugh, uuuuuuuh... <cf>How pathetic... sniff
Y
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lancer
Wow! Oh, you! <cf>No, I'm not tired! I'm not worried!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
... I'm kidding. Sorry, I was sorry...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
... It's becoming a bit surprising.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm scared not that good at fighting monsters.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I can't do it to a certain extent now, but when I first thought a Blitz Lancer I couldn't do it at all.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I believe you that one-on-one is the basis of Blitz Lancer, right? <cf>But I'm afraid it's scares me.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I was glaring at <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/> just now, and then <cf>I couldn't possibly move my body.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
So I was blown away and escaped.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I got to lose away and lose on two jobs... <cf>I felt so pathetic that tears came to my eyes.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Sniff... I'm leaving and complaining, but the <cf>most important thing right now is to finish the request.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Sorry for bothering you so often. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>Could I ask you to ask them as well?
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
My hands are shaking and I can't hold the spear shampoo
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I think I've twisted my ankle a little, so I'll just wait here patiently.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>and come back. <cf>Please help me!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Please feel free <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/> for me. <cf>It's a pathetic request, but please help me.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm just hanging out here. <cf>Come back when you're done.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>For defeating it! <cf>thank you! You saved me!
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
... Haa. <cf>This time, I was spinning my wheels
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
The reason I wanted to become an adventurer is because I simply wanted to become an adventurer.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I lost my parents early and was in poor health, so I was always a nuisance to those around me.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I felt to at least get in shape, but <cf>it just didn't go as well as I'd like...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
The person who was called out to me at that time was a senior citizen I learned.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
He fights me how to train my body, what it means to be an adventurer, and most of all, he fights me about Blitz Lancer.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
And that's how I chose a Blitz Lancer.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
However, he was never able to overcome the challenge of facing an enemy one-on-one.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
I thought that if I could have been <value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/> here, I could show my senior how much I've grown.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
How relaxed... Ugh. They're leaving me like a kid again...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
... This is no time to cry. *sniff* <cf>The client is waiting for me.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's deliver “Roadside Star Grass” to Ralpal. <cf>I don't really want to meet my senior...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's deliver “Roadside Star Grass” to Ralpal. <cf>I don't really want to meet my senior...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Oh! You're the Adventurer who accepted the request!
Y
Npc_Villager
Npc_Lancer
This is a must-have “Roadside Star Grass”. <cf>Thank you very much.
Y
Npc_Villager
Npc_Lancer
<value type="enemyName" id="E007_00_00_01001"/>Was also busy. <cf>It wasn't me, but my junior,
Y
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Villager
So... I heard that there were other adventurers who wanted us here...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Villager
Oh, you're the Blitz Lancer who said you were looking for the Legendary Spear.
Y
Npc_Villager
Npc_Lancer
He was on a request to leave another monster, but <cf>he finished it and left a while ago.
Y
Npc_Villager
Npc_Lancer
Are we just sitting each other? <cf>It's a pity, but also a relief...
Y
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Villager
Are You Still Playing for the Legendary Spear?
Y
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Villager
That's what he said. <cf>I think it was “Zenithshaft”
Y
Npc_Villager
Npc_Lancer
It's My Senior After All. <cf>He's looking for a spear called the “Zenith Shaft.”
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
IT'S A SPEAR THAT ARTISTS IN AN OLD LEGEND, AND IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN THROUGH THE HANDS OF MANY HEROES.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Of course, it may not exist, and even if it did, it would have been impossible to be in Tatters.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
But still, I wanted to check it out
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
... If I could find Zenithshaft, <cf>would be my senior specialist me?
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Oh... that's right. I was tired to show off like this and I was in trouble. I'm sorry.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
But it was good that I asked you. <cf>My senior told me to do it before.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
[“] Don't try to do it alone. Cherish your friends [”]
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
Thank you for this. <cf>I hope I can return the favor someday.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
'Don't try to do everything by yourself. <cf>Cherish your friends. '
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
This is what my senior told me It's true.
Y
Npc_Lancer
Player
[PATH]309*\Scenario\CAV106_004.uasset[PATH]
it looks like my senior is still searching for the legendary spear
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
If I find a clue, I wonder if I can help Senpai. <cf>nope...
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
]
<cf>If I find that spear, I think they'll be even more surprised
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
hey, you. Do you remember the <cf>“Zenith Shaft” spears?
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
there it is. I told you about it during my previous request, right? It's about the <cf>legendary spear my senior is looking for
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
Actually, I thought I'd look for “Zenith Shaft”
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
If I could find them before my seniors, I would feel really confident
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>Even if you can't find it, I don't think it's a waste
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
You can't just admire your senpai. <cf>I want to act, get results, and be recognized
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>But I might run into trouble again if I'm alone, so I want you to help me. Best regards, please
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
that's it. I was doing a lot of research, and there were people who knew about <cf>“Zenith Shaft”!
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>A merchant in Ritz says he'll tell me about “Zenith Shaft” as a reward for the request
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'd like to go listen to the story right away, okay?
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>The request is to defeat the one that appears in <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> “<value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/>”
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
It's not that difficult, so let's clean it up quickly!
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>It is said that “Zenith Shaft” will appear to the brave. It would be great if they came out before us
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>Once you've defeated them, it's time to gather at Rize!
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's <value type="locationName" id="fld003_C"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/> defeat “”
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
When we're done, we'll meet at Ritz. Let's go listen to the <cf>client's story about “Zenith Shaft”
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
huh... ugh... damn... <cf>that's annoying... wow...!
c
Npc_Lancer

What about you? Are you familiar with currants?
c
Unknown
Player
ah... you. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>Is the subjugation over?
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
Mr. Ruger. <cf>This is my junior Blitz Lancer
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Oh, is that right! <cf>I asked Currant. they say they have amazing juniors
c
Npc_Lhugel
Player
I'm Ruger. Nice to meet you. <cf>I used to take care of currants
c
Npc_Lhugel
Player
Oh, is it a currant? <cf>they said I took my prey. I did something bad
c
Npc_Lhugel
Player
That's wrong! <cf>I was taken by surprise... and Mr. Ruger saved me there
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
I was able to see a disappointing place again... wow...
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
You still have a long way to go, Currant. <cf>Well, if it makes you cry, it's better
c
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
Look, take care of the wound. <cf>It must have been done in a pretty flashy way
c
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
yeah... ... huh? Eh, it's not there!
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
“Massey's Elixir”... did you drop it!?
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
“Massey's Elixir”? Is that the drug I used to take?
c
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
that's true. <cf>I'd like to search for it, but... at my own request, I have to go soon
c
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
I'm sorry. Can I leave the rest up to you?
c
Npc_Lhugel
Player
I wonder if the currant one won't be able to move for a while. Search for <cf>“Massey's Elixir” instead
c
Npc_Lhugel
Player
Currant, don't let your guard down anymore. Bye
c
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
sorry... It even bothers you
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>“Massey's Elixir” is like an amulet for me
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
It's an important thing I got from Mr. Ruger, so...
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
It must have fallen somewhere on the “Ritz Trade Route.” <cf>Find it and bring it to me

<cf>“Massey's Elixir” is like an amulet I got from Mr. Ruger

This drug was discovered by Ruger at the ruins
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>They used it when I was a fledgling person when I was injured like now. It works really well
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
So he gave me the rest. <cf>There aren't many, so use it in times of emergency
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
Even though I was taking care of it, I can't believe it fell... What's more<cf>, it looks like Ruger was saved by Mr. Ruger
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>It's pathetic, both as a Blitz Lancer and as an adventurer... wow, sooo
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
... damn, how long will I keep on indulging, me! <cf>they're in the middle of a request, aren't they!
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm sorry. <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>subjugation was the main subject, wasn't it? <cf>The client is in Rize, so let's go report

<cf>I took a detour, but I have to get them to tell me about “Zenith Shaft”

<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>Subjugation of was the main subject, wasn't it? <cf>The client is a Ritze merchant. Let's go report
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>Oh, are you the adventurer who defeated them by any chance? <value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_00_01001"/>
c
Npc_merchant
Player
Oh, that's right. <cf>That being said, it was mostly because this guy did it
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_merchant
Please pay this guy the reward. There's something else I want you to <cf>tell me
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_merchant
<cf>I heard that the merchant knows about “Zenith Shaft”
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_merchant
Is it “Zenith Shaft”? Yes, I know it. It's a legendary spear that <cf>emits blue light
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
<cf>A few years ago, I met an adventurer with a spear like that
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
They said it was a spear they found in ruins somewhere
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
<cf>It was in tatters and didn't seem useful as a weapon, but it certainly had a blue glow
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
<cf>However, it seems that the owner went missing in the middle of defeating the monster
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
I haven't seen it since
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
that's right... <cf>Well then, I don't know where it is now
c
Npc_Lancer
Npc_merchant
I'm so sorry. <cf>By the way, there are people who have listened to the same story
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
I think you said Mr. Ruger
c
Npc_merchant
Npc_Lancer
Is this a story that Mr. Ruger already knows? <cf>well, that's right
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>Hmm, as expected, I wonder if it would be difficult to find “Zenith Shaft” before Mr. Ruger...
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
No, you can't give up so easily! <cf>Well then, I'm no different from who I was until now
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>I'll try to find out more about The Adventurer and the Blue Glowing Spear
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
This time I showed Mr. Ruger something pathetic. <cf>you too. So, we have to recover properly!
c
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'll definitely find “Zenith Shaft”! It's a game with <cf>Ruger!

ZenithShaft's Clues <cf>And Something That Rugel Doesn't Know...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm sure you've been brought into the Legends and Ruins. <cf>So what else is there?
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
t
Hey, good job! <cf>I'm thinking of going to hunt down an ogre this time
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
There's something I'm a bit curious about. <cf>It might be related to “Zenithshaft”
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
The Merchant in Ritz said he met an adventurer with a glowing blue spear, right?
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I feel like the place where the adventurer went missing was close to the place where the ogre disappeared.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
It's just my hunch sweater.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
The Reclamation Bureau Offered Records of the Adventurers Who Took to It. <cf>I want to check those out first.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
If it has anything to do with Zenithshaft, then of course I'll go and overcome the Ogre.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
At that time, I need your help. Thanks!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
First, let's go to the second floor of the Reclamation Bureau. Let's check out the bookshelves.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
“Zenithshaft” will be the hero before the hero... <cf>I'll find it before Mr. Rugel does!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
The Records of Adventurers Who Possessed the Zenith Shaft Should Be Kept in the Reclamation Bureau's bookshelf.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's look into that first. <cf>Is it related to the Ogre of Montegnor Valley...?
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Found it! <cf>This is the record of an adventurer who had the Zenith Shaft.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
[“An Adventurer Withering An Ancient, Glowing Blue Spear”] is what it says. <cf>This is it, no harm about it!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
This is a record from decades years ago. <cf>[“] Received a request to exterminate an ogre in the Melisos River basin [”]...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
After that... [“] Did not return, no contact [”]. <cf>[“] The Request Is Requested to Have Failed [”]...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Well, maybe it can't be difficult... <cf>I WILDN'T WANT TO HAVE A RECORD LIKE THIS LEFT BEHIND
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
... Huh? This Ogre... <cf>Hasn't He Took Me After the Request?
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Maybe... the Adventurers didn't win, but they might have been able to the corner the Ogre.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
So maybe that's why the ogre that was healing its relaxation has recently started rampaging <cf>again!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I'm curious. <cf>I guess I should check it out.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Okay, let's go to the “Mellisos River Basin”! <cf>There May Be Traces of the “Zenith Shaft” or Adventurers.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
An ogre riding in Montegnor Valley and riding an adventurer with the Zenith Shaft.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Let's go to the “Mellisos River Basin”! <cf>There May Be Traces of the “Zenithshaft” and Adventurers.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Mr. Rugel!?
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
What kind of meal? <cf>You're getting tired!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Feeling... and you too...
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
I heard that an adventurer thought the Zenith Shaft had come to this area...
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
While I was tired, I came across an ogre. <cf>An Ogre Brings A Tiny Spear On His Back.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
That's... ' Zenith Shaft'!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Yeah. I was distracted by that guy too. <cf>And I was caught off guard, and here I am.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
Mr. Rugel, did you come alone? That's outrageous.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
[“] Don't try to do it alone. Cherish your friends [”] <cf>Mr. Rugel explains me that
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
“Zenithshaft” is my personal obsession. <cf>I Feel Relaxed Getting Relaxed Relaxation
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
If so, just tell me...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
... Mr. Rugel, please use this.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
“Mashi's Elixir”...? <cf>It's gone now. Can't use it.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
It's okay. Use it and take a rest.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
We will throw the Ogre. <cf>We will also get the Zenith Shaft.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Defeated... you're up against an ogre. <cf>Are you OK?
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
I didn't think I could do it if I was alone. <cf>On the Decent, I Think I Would Panic and Cry.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
But now I feel calm. <cf>I have reliable friends by my side.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
I'm sorry for sorry this is for you. <cf>Would you like to fight the Ogre with me?
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
thank you! <cf>I wanted you'd come with me!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
... YOU'VE GROWN, HORIZONS.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
I'm a Blitz Lancer too. <cf>I can't keep relaxing pathetic things forever.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Let's go! <cf>Throw the Ogre and get the Zenith Shaft!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
<cf>The Ogre Who Possessed the Zenith Shaft must be possessed in the Melissos River Basin.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
Scissors for loot or something. <cf>Don't worry about it, it's not a weapon.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
However, the Ogre shampoo is still dangerous. <cf>Don't let your guard down.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
But still, that crazy guy... <cf>He's become so cheeky.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
There it is, that Ogre...!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
This looks like a place to sleep. <cf>The Zenith Shaft is... nearby.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I can't just take that all home. <cf>I have to hate the Ogre after all.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
No, it's okay. <cf>I was planning to fight from the beginning.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Since Mr. Rugel did something to me, I won't be afraid until I get revenge!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I am Blitz Lancer! <cf>I can't just stand by and watch My Teammates get excited!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Now, prepare yourself! Ogre! <cf>We will celebrate you!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Haa, haa... I did it...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
<span size="Big">Yeeeessssssss!! </>
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
We did it! <cf>We celebrate the Ogre! Yay!!!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Ahahahahaha! IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU! <cf>I beat that Ogre! AMAZING!!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
[--] Ah! That's right, “Zenithshaft”!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
No, no. I almost always. <cf>So this is “Zenithshaft”...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
It's old and worn out. <cf>But it sure does emit a blue light.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
The LEGENDARY SPEAR THAT RUGEL was meant for.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
... Eh? [“] The Spear That Tales Before the Hero [”]? <cf>There was a legend like that too.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
If you say that, the Ogre will also become a hero. <cf>Shame, I don't think it's about me.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Now, let's go back to Mr. Rugel! <cf>He'll be so happy when he sees this spear!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I was able to overcome the Ogre and the Zenith Shaft.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Great results! thank you! <cf>Now, let's go back to Mr. Rugel!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
You're back. <cf>... It looks like you did it.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
hehehe... <span size="Big">Tada! </>
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
What do you think, Mr. Rugel? <cf>This is the spear that emits a blue light, the “Zenith Shaft”!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Yes, there's no harm about it. <cf>This is the Zenithshaft I've been looking for.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
I Never Thought That Thought Would Get There First
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
I finally did it!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Good job, Karant. <cf>You Won't Be Struggling of a Fight Assault, Will You?
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
Oh, come to think of it... when I felt the Ogre, I didn't even think about being thought about being felt.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
That is proof that you have truly become pregnant.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
What's more, I have such wonderful friends. <cf>It's something I can't do as a lone wolf.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
Let me thank you too <cf>Thank you for being very happy
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
They are together, not alone. <cf>This must have been a great experience for Karant.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Player
Slightly. Because YOU JOINED FORCES WITH YOUR ALLIES, YOU WERE ABLE TO LIKE THE ZENITHSHAFT.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
You are a true hero worthy of this spear.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
Mr. Rugel... ugh, uuuuh... <cf>Uuuuuuh...!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
What, are you tired again?
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
These are tears of joy! <cf>I'm so happy that Rugel-san feels me...
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Sniff, ugh! <cf>But you're also a friend, Rugel-san!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
From now on, as a fellow Blitz Lancer, <cf>I'll fight against you!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Hmph, how do you say that... <cf>Okay. I'll take care of you, buddy.
Z
Npc_Lhugel
Npc_Lancer
Yes!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Npc_Lhugel
Thank you for all your help! <cf>It had nothing to do with you being a senior or whatever.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
Teaching you has taught me to reassure myself. <cf>More than anything, I have grown thanks to you.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
One day I'll help you! <cf>I can't say it enough. Thank you so much!
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
I left the Zenithshaft in the Care of the Reclamation Bureau. <cf>It was used as a research material as part of the accident.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
It was too worn out to be worn as a weapon worn.
Z
Npc_Lancer
Player
So that I can fight without fear on the legendary spear. <cf>I need to keep training more and more!
Z
Npc_Lancer

Han! If you had to choose a class, how about a beat performer?
E
Npc_Glen
Player
It's the only class that exciting sound and battle. It's exciting!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
?
It's a new class, so I need to appeal to everyone. <cf>If you're tired, give it a try!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! Welcome to the party! <cf>I'm Glenn, the beat performer
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Are you a new beat performer? <cf>If so, you're just like me. I look forward to working with you!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Beat performers are a teenager new class. <cf>Should I say they have a short history?
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Fighter to the Aegis Fighter etc., It's Aegis a Recently Created Class.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Maybe that's why I feel like the true appeal of beat performers isn't really known to everyone.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
There's no class as hot, awesome, and <cf>cool as beat performers!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
But people don't get tired. <cf>So I chose to make it as clear as possible!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
First, why don't you try a request? <cf>The Request is to Visit Uribo in the “Sea Roaring Plains”
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Huh? Is this a request that requires two people to do? <cf>Well, it's a Uribo.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
To be honest, it was too boring and no one would take it on. <cf>THE PEOPLE AT THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION WERE A BIT TOO.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
That's why. Why don't we beat performers take on this and do it
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Doing things that no one else does! <cf>It'll improve the reputation of beat performers, right?
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! I think that's a great idea! <cf>This kind of steady effort is important.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, since we both have some makeup to make, let's meet outside the gates of asterlies.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Don't go ahead alone, okay? <cf>See you later. Thanks!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
I'm going to travel Uribo in “The Sea Roaring Plains.” <cf>It's not a big deal, but I'll make sure I'm prepared.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's meet later outside the gates of asterlies. <cf>Please don't go ahead and be alone.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! Looks like you're ready! <cf>Okay, let's go and hunt Uribo!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
The Real Talents of a Beat performer are their teammates. <cf>You'll shine more if you fight together with someone!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
While we're at it, let's review a bit.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
When you think of a beat performer, the first thing that comes to mind is this weapon. <cf>A weapon like weapon... or is it a weapon like instrument?
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, sorry! Using this to make sounds resonate is the true essence of a beat performer!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
The Sounds of the Beat Performer has various effects, such as attacking allies and attacking enemies.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Use sound to gain an advantage in battle. <cf>This is the role of the beat performer.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Of Course, The Beat Performers Can Fight <cf>Their suits are designed for hand-to-hand combat.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
You Can't Do Anything Without Friends, That's Lame
E
Npc_Glen
Player
This time, our restaurant is Uribo in the Sea Roaring Plains. <cf>This way, we can fight alone.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
I mean, I don't think it's right to gang up on Uribo and just beat him up...
E
Npc_Glen
Player
3 for you and me. <cf>If we decide each of them, the request will be completed.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, let's get this done done! <cf>When we're done, let's meet here again.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
hang! [It's excited]! <cf>IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE SOMETHING GREAT SOUNDS TODAY!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Three Uribos in the Sea Roaring Plains <cf>I wonder if this will be over strange?
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! If you're a beat performer, you're a good one. <cf>Let's get this over with relaxation!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's meet here again when we're done? <cf>Well, I'm counting on you, buddy!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, good job! <cf>Looks like you've finished defeating Uribo!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
I heard a great sound. <cf>You have great skills and tastes!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Thanks to you, the request has been completed. <cf>Han! I Can Now Proudly Report It. thank you!
E
Npc_Glen
Player
If we can get results like this, the image of beat performers will improve.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
There are some stubborn people out there. <cf>Hang on! I think I can show them something.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Because you always look down on me. <cf>Beat performers are a class of their own.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Oh, sorry! <cf>I'm just complaining about something boring. Please ignore me.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Expectations, I believe to continue working musicians as a beat performer.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
Please help me if you feel like it. <cf>It was really good working with you.
E
Npc_Glen
Player
I'd love to have a session with you! <cf>See you soon! Thanks!

The Breasts of Beat Performers is an Intrigued Performer. <cf>Han! The Reputation Remains to Be Good!
J

But while the young ones are fine, the reaction from the older generation is still not that great.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
d
Well, let's make a steady appeal. <cf>There's No Longer That Beat Performer is the best!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey! How is your beat performance going? <cf>Are you making a good sound?
J
Npc_Glen
Player
I'm not married about you. <cf>It should raise the stock of beat performers.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
I think that number of people who know about beat performers are musicians.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
So, I found another job that nobody wanted to do. I've just been it. accepted
J
Npc_Glen
Player
This is your chance to show off as a beat performer! <cf>Please lend us your strength again this time.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
The client is a pharmacist from Minsterhorn, and the request is to collect medicine materials and medicinal monsters.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
It seems like a relaxation request, right? <cf>But this client, a pharmacist, is a tricky character.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
She's An Incurable Cranky Old Lady, So <cf>Adventurers Across the Board Are Asking Her.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
That's where we beat performers come in!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Leave the Matter of Grandma to Me. <cf>I'm used to teenagers with stubborn people.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
If they say something, just ignore them. <cf>You should focus on the request.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, first up is the Minsterhorn. <cf>Let's go meet that cranky old lady.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
The client is the old pharmacist of Minsterhorn. <cf>Let's go and hear what she has to say first.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
She talks to be a really cranky old lady. <cf>Leave it to me. I'm used to those emotions of people.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
THE MORE STUBBORN THE PEOPLE ARE, THE MORE THEY LIKE TO BEAT PERFORMERS.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, that has nothing to do with this request. <cf>Let's celebrate up and head to Minsterhorn!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
What is it, you guys? <cf>What business do you have at this rundown pharmacy?
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
YOU GOOD YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HELP ON MEDICINE. <cf>Eat and sleep! That sleeping cures you.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
No, no, I came here at the Request of the Reclamation Bureau. <cf>You're looking for medicines, right? Grandma.
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Ah? Are You Guys Adventurers? <cf>You're leaving in such a strange way.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
What do you mean? <cf>We are Beat Performers!
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
I see, I don't know what the young guys are doing. <cf>Well, as long as they do the work, that's fine.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
Okay, so what should I bring?
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
'Kisuri grass', 'Ryōfu stone', 'Kanmi shell' <cf>Please find all three types.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
Then, after that, we'll hunt the Skyfish. <cf>They eat up all the snacks for teenagers.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
There are customers waiting for medicine, so <cf>I think I'll have you finish gathering the relaxation first.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
If that instrument or weapon or whatever isn't, it will be over dangerous.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
You're such a talkative old lady! <cf>Can't you just ask me questions?
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
It's a surprise request, so if you just asked someone, I think <cf>someone would have done it.
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Hmph! I don't want people who choose their requests based on other people's conversations.
J

If you don't like it, just go home. <cf>Is that all there is to a beat performer?
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
Han! You said it! <cf>A Beat Performer Never Thought A Second Thought!
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
You're just going to throw away a request you've been accepted! <cf>Just watch me take care of it!
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Okay, let's go! <cf>First, gather the materials. There were three types.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
'Little Grass', 'Cool Breeze Stone', 'Citrine Shell' <cf>All of these can be found in 'Minster'
J
Npc_Glen
Player
'Kisuri grass', 'Reifu stone', 'Kanmi shell'. <cf>These are the medicines for the medicine.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Player
You can find them all in Minster Hills. <cf>I'll have you clear that out first.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Player
After that, I asked you to ask the Skyfish. <cf>That's an easy thing for an adventurer to do.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Player
PLEASE SHOW US THAT BEAT PERFORMERS ARE MORE THAN JUST JUST STRONGERS
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Player
I found “Kisuri grass”
J
Npc_information
Npc_information
Found the “Cool Breeze Stone”
J
Npc_information
Npc_information
I found a 'Kanmi shell'
J
Npc_information
Npc_information
Okay, we've got all the materials! <cf>Good job, that was a big help
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Are these materials fine, but <cf>is the next step to becoming the Skyfish?
J
Npc_Glen
Player
That old lady is really rough with people. <cf>No wonder adventurers don't come near her.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, that's not why we <cf>submit a request!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Skyfish can be found in Minster Hills. <cf>It's not like that it hurts to kill them hate it.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
You said that there was a customer waiting for medicine. <cf>I feel like they'll hurt if I don't deliver the sorry first...
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Oh well! I'll run and bring the materials to Grandma.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
You Go Ahead and Start the Hunt <cf>I'll be there soon.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
The request says to kill three of them at a time. <cf>Let's get this done right!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
You Go and Marry the Skyfish First. <cf>IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ONLY NEED TO EXIST THREE OF THEM.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
I'll deliver the medicine medicine to Grandma. <cf>I'll come right away after that.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
After the Subjugation, Let's Go and Report to Grandma. <cf>Well then, I'll be counting on you!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, Grandma! <cf>I did as I was told and finished it.
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
I Cleanse the Hygiene for the Medicine and Hygiene the Skyfish <cf>Cleanly. You have no doubts, right?
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Hmm, I heard some kind of loud music. <cf>Do Adventurers These Days Fight Like That?
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
If you make that much noise, the monsters won't come near you.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
At least say thank you!
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Oh well. <cf>Well, we're heading home now.
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Wait. You Noisy One Over There <cf>You need some medicine, bring it.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
If The Skin On Your Fingers Is Wrong, Won't Your Proud Sound Be Diminished?
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
Hmm, don't underestimate an old hag. <cf>You Better Take Good Care of Your Tools of the Trade.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
You, The Quiet Guy Over There, Feeling Fine, But <cf>If You're Not Feeling Well, Just Rest Feeling Well.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Player
I NEED YOU GUYS TO STAY HEALTHY
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Player
What's up with you all of a kind you're being so nice? <cf>It's making me feel all off.
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
The Next Time I Get A Request, I'll Be In Trouble If I Don't Have A Feeling Adventurer I Can Call On Without Hesitation.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
Huh?! Is that the reason?
J
Npc_Glen
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
They're beat performers, right? I'll remember that. <cf>They're kind hearted and meddlesome people.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
The kind of person who puts up with the cranky old hag's nastiness and does his job well,
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
Ahh, that strange music is stuck in my head. <cf>I have to tell everyone in the village about it.
J
Npc_Old_Pharmacist
Npc_Glen
... That old lady, what did she say, did she say<cf>, did she say us?
J
Npc_Glen
Player
I think that the music of beat performers has great power.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Adventurers put their bodies on the line every day, don't they? <cf>Some of them get tired or even lose their lives.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Everyone loves adventurers and adventures on them, but <cf>it's not all fun and games.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
That's why this world needs music!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Even if there are scary, scary, or scary things, <cf>I want to be able to light up everyone's hearts with hope.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Beat Performers Don't Just Fight. <cf>They're a class that has the power to connect people!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
There are still people who simply deny it, but <cf>times are changing. We are the ones who are changing it!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! I just spoke <cf>If you'd like, please lend me your help.
J
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's make the future of beat performers shine with our own hands!
J
Npc_Glen
Player
[PATH]381*\Scenario\CAV107_003.uasset[PATH]
By the way, what kind of weapon do you use?
u
Npc_Glen
Player
I WANT TO CHOOSE A PIECE THAT REALLY SUITS MY TASTE AND SENSE.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
o
Our sound depends on our emotions. <cf>We have to take chemistry into account too.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, I've been waiting for this! This time's request <cf>I'll have to put in more effort than relaxation!
u
Npc_Glen
Player
After all, it's a request to specify a beat performer!
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Assume I get requests to specify routines or classes.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
But it's rare to get a request from a beat performer! <cf>Maybe My Reputation is Intriguing Reputation.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Oh? Rumor has it that a client has come.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Hello, hello! <cf>I'm Nadris, the person who believes this.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
Kyo, thank you for coming today! Awawawawa
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
Yes, nice to meet you! <cf>Are You Feeling A Bit Feeling?
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Um, well... relaxation, this is my first time talking to a beat performer...
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Well, it feels, it feels a little scary... <cf>THE MUSIC IS INTENSE AND THE SOUND IS LOUD.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I'm sorry! It's rude of me to say this on our first meeting. <cf>I Know You're a Great Adventurer!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I, I can't keep trying I'm not good at it, so <cf>I, I think I'll just go ahead and ask for a request!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I see. So you put out a request for beat performers.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
If you don't like beat performers, then that's fine.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Of course, I'd be happy if you wanted me. <cf>There are times when our personal feelings just don't match.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
No, no! The Priest also said that we should not judge people by their preconceptions or preconceptions!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Oh, don't worry! At First Glance, Thoughts of You Might Be That Scary!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Haha, that's great! <cf>I'll do my best to complete your request, so don't worry.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Thank you This time, I would like you to help me with a plant survey in the Andorra Basin.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
That place is home to goblins, and it's dangerous for investigators like us alone...
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
First, could you please escort me to the Bafarian Cult Garrison?
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
OK. <cf>Please tell me the details when we get there.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Okay, let's go! First, let's head to the garrison in the Andorra Basin.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
First, escort Nadris to the Andorra Basin.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
The Bafarian Cult's Garrison would be a good place to be. <cf>Let's go there.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
It explains that you can learn more about it there. <cf>Well, let's get excited!
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, good job! <cf>Looks like you're wearing clothes
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Thank you. <cf>Then let's start the relaxation.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
As I chose before we left, there is a goblin teenager in the Andorra Basin.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
The Plant I Want to Collect for Research is Growing Nearby.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
We just need to kick the goblins away
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
No, I think it's impossible to hate them all. <cf>I want to chase them away and attract their attention.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
In that sense, I thought that maybe the music of beat performers might be effective.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Oh, I see! If we make a loud noise, the goblins will come too.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
So Nadris can just collect them in the trash. <cf>That's clever!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Is that so? I'm getting tired when I'm tired. <cf>hehe, hehehe
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I'll try not to stand out, so you two should stand out.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Han! Leave it to me! When it comes to standing out, no one can beat Beat Performer!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Okay! Let's go and relax goblins in style! <cf>The goal for each of us is to lose five of them.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
When you're done, gather here. <cf>Let's get playing!!
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's enjoy the goblins in the Andorra Basin. <cf>It would be good if we each chose five of them.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
We'll attract their attention so they don't go to Nadris.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
If you want to stand out, that's where beat performers come in! <cf>Let's make some loud noises and go wild!
u
Npc_Glen
Player
All the right! Goblin subjugation complete!
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Your Sound Reminded Out! <cf>Even the Goblins Can't Ignore You.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! I was really tired too. <cf>I can't beat that sound.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Thank you both!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
Thanks to that, I was able to collect the plant I was looking for. <cf>The Goblins Didn't Even Notice Me
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
I'm Glad I Asked Beat Performer!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Player
Han! Have you started to think a little more about Beat Performers?
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Yes! Of course!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I'm clumsy and tone deaf, and I can't play any instruments at all...
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
That's why I thought it was really cool to see beat performers fighting while playing music!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Also, when I heard the music, I felt relieved that the beat performer was nearby.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
The loud noise was a bit scary at first, but <cf>I felt it was a very scary sound!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
That sound is proof that the beat performers are working hard for everyone.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Han! When you say that, I don't feel bad about it, yeah
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Come on! The work is done. <cf>Go back and report, report!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Oh, that's right. <cf>Well, the original client was the Bafaria cult.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
So I have to go to the Temple of Asterlies. <cf>Um, can you come with me?
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Ugh, the Baphalia Temple...
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
No, nothing. The client asked me to. <cf>I'll follow you to the temple or anywhere.
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
That's why. <cf>Let's take Nadris to the Temple of Asterlies.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
It wants that Nadris's request must be rejected to the Temple of Asterlies.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
I don't really want to get too close... <cf>The client asked me to, so I have no choice.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's escort Nadris to the temple.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Okay, here we are. <cf>As always, it's an attractive place.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's go home when we're done. <cf>There are a lot of troublesome people here.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Y-you're right. I Might Want to Go Home soon too...
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Oh, but before that, let me thank you both so much again.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Thank you very much. <cf>The Thoughts Went Yesterday.
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Thanks to this request, I have become a big fan of <cf>Beat Performer!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Han! That's a nice thing to say! <cf>It's the first time someone has been called me a fan
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Is that so? Then I'm your number one fan!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Nadris! What are you doing there?!
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
Ahh! daddy!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
Are you with an adventurer again, on a quest? <cf>I ALWAYS TELL YOU TO BE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHO YOU DATE.
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
And guess what? He's a beat performer! <cf>A pathetic guy with a bunch of sick people.
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
DON'T KEEP ON THINKING LIKE A STUDENT FOREVER, <cf>MAKE AN EFFORT TO EXPERIENCE YOUR JOURNEY AT THE TEMPLE!
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
I'm sorry...
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
Hey, old man! <cf>DON'T JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE AND ACT ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Nadris has completed a request from the cult. <cf>I don't see why would I hate!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Hmph, look at that. When you open your mouth, you have no class. <cf>Are that's what beat performers like.
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
Don't let those frivolous guys who are only going to be in music and want to be pampering come near my daughter!
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
The God of Baphalia is strange. <cf>At the Very Least, Don't Cause Any Trouble to Others.
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
No, stop it, Dad!
u
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
You too, come over, Nadris! <cf>You won't get close to these people!
u
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
How relaxed! Every single priest <cf>does what they want!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Glen
That's why I didn't want to go near a place like this!
u
Npc_Glen
Npc_Glen
Tch... sorry. I lost my temper. <cf>I didn't mean to hit you with that. Sorry.
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Han, I'm so board, let's call it a day
u
Npc_Glen
Player
Thank you for your help. <cf>Please help me again next time. See you
u
Npc_Glen
Player
[PATH]509*\Scenario\CAV107_004.uasset[PATH]
I think the number of people who play beat performers have extremely tired.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
But some stubborn people are <cf>still struggling.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
?
Ahh, I feel so excited! <cf>But even if I say it back, nothing will change.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I got another request, so let's do it together.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Huh? Are you feeling low? <cf>Well, the client this time is a bit...
?
Npc_Glen
Player
This is a request from the Bafaria cult.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I wasn't asked to do this. <cf>I could have just ignored it.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, remember Nadris who was with us on the previous request? <cf>She was the one who said she wasn't good at beat performers.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Even though she was up against a beat performer she didn't like, she still made the right request and in the end she was beaten.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
When I think about it like that, I feel like I shouldn't be afraid mean things like I hate the cult.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
So I chose to accept the request from the temple.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
WH-what?! <cf>I know it's not like that at all!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
But... if I continue to be lame, <cf>I'll hate you too.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Delicate! That's why I'm counting on you! <cf>I'll listen to your request at the Temple of Asterlies!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Stop laughing and let's get going! Come on!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I think it was unfounded of me to choose a request from the cult.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
But it's so lame to keep you don't like it or that you don't like it like it like a tantrum<cf>!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's go to the temple and hear what he has to say! <cf>Oh come on, let's get this request over with motivation!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
You Guys Are The Beat Performers Presents with Nadris! <cf>You don't mean you accepted a request from the temple?
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
I Told You Not to Cause Trouble for Other People!
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
We just the request. accepted <cf>We're not worried you have any trouble.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
The Mere Fact That People Like You Who Disrupt Public Order Come To The Temple Is A Nuisance!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
<span size="Big">What the...?! </>
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
(Ugh...! No, hold on, hold on. Hold on, me.)
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Glen
Oh, come on, don't say that. <cf>Why not give it a try?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
We are also adventurers registered with the Reclamation Bureau. <cf>We will take requests soon, so it'll be fine.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Hmph, I won't be fooled by your virtuous behavior! <cf>I'm sure your favorite this time is to get closer to my daughter.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
YOU'RE DECEIVING MY DAUGHTER UNDER THE DECESSES OF A REQUEST. <cf>That's not something you can trust!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
(Gggghhh...! ... No, that's not right. <cf>If I start a fight here, it'll just be the same as always.)
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Glen
Oh, I want to say what you want to say. <cf>Let me talk about the request. Once I hear it, I'll go home.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
What's with that stupid idiot? <cf>Show off those flashy clothes!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
A beat performer who is not well could <cf>commit a crime at any time!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
<span size="Big">Shut up, you old fool!! </>
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
I told you to tell me the details of the request!! <cf>I didn't come here to listen to a joke!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
It's noisy. What are you doing?
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Gi, Gim-sama!? Why are you here!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Gim
[--] Treymon. How is the mission you ordered me to perform? <cf>I don't think I've received the report yet.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Tramon
... I am giving advice to a young man who is having someone. <cf>I am sorry. I will get to it right away.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Gim
I've left the request to Nadris. <cf>Go to Ralpal and ask him about it.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
A Young Man with Bad Behaviour, eh? <cf>Glenn, do you have anything to say?
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
... Han, nothing. <cf>We just came here for work.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Let's go, buddy. <cf>I heard Nadris is in Ralpal.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Don't Cause Any Trouble, Glenn.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Han, I don't know. <cf>You guys are just making a fuss about this.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Tch, what a sad face. <cf>I had no business with him.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Nothing, never mind. <cf>Shut up, let's finish the request.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Nadris is in Ralpal. <cf>Let's go talk and talk to him.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Oh, Glenn and Adventurer! <cf>You've The Request. Accepted
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Good. I didn't know who was coming. <cf>I'm relieved that it's you two.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Oh, nice to meet you again. Nadris
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
So what should we do? <cf>Tell me now
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
...? Um, yes. I'm tired.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
This time, we have a chance from the people at Ralpal. <cf>They are having damage to the exterior walls and fences of buildings.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Dishes, some of the building materials used were they one's horn that goats like to eat.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
So we wash to kill the insects contents of the horn Goat to identify the plant.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
If you avoid the building materials that horn goats like, you should be able to kill them from eating them.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
We would like you two to hunt down about 5 Horn Goats for our research.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I will eat you and collect what the Horn Goat has shampoo.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Our job isn't tough, but <cf>Nadris must be pretty tough.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
I think it would be pretty tough to lose the contents of the shampoo.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Haha... Yes <cf>No one was willing to do it.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
But someone has to do it. <cf>If other people don't want to do it, I'll try my best.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I'm sure your father will be scolding you again, married, [“] You're a marriageable daughter! [”]
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I see... That's right. It takes guts to willingly do things that people don't like.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Oh, well... Glenn, you don't want to be in good spirits. <cf>Could it be that my father is...?
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
No, it's not Nadris's father's fault.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
It's about my family. <cf>There are some strange people in My Family Too.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
And he's also a priest of Bafaria. <cf>He's so nagging, and so condescending...
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Han! Stop it, stop it! <cf>I'm starting to feel pathetic massage this
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
You Had to Succeed Five Horn Goats, right? <cf>Is it the one in “God's Hill”?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Okay, this will be over in no time! <cf>Let's get this done!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's Get the Five Horn Goats in “God's Dying Hill”
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It looks like Nadris will retrieve the contents of the thoughts. <cf>We should throw on the hunt.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It's not a big job, but Nadris is there, so I have to be tired.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Come back here when you're done. <cf>Let's get started!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! Good job! <cf>Your sound was great this time too!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Thank you very much. <cf>We are also tired what the goat horn ate.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Player
I'll return to Asterlies now and stay together with the Bafaria cult.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Player
Oh, you're going to the temple to report. <cf>Then, I'll take you there.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
I HOPE MY DAD DOESN'T FIND ME AGAIN AND START WHINING ABOUT IT.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
I'm sorry. Dad <cf>cares about me too much.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Even going outside for a little while is cause for motivation, and <cf>even field research like this one is wrong.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Recently, he's been talking things like, “Don't listen to frivolous stuff,” and even starting to comment on the music I listen to...
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I know. I have a similar shampoo.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
My Family Has Been Priests of the Bafaria Presents for Generations, and <cf>We Have a More Familiar View.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
They Didn't Accept Anything Other Than Traditional Music, and Beat Performers Were Out of the Question.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
My brother has Risen to the Rank of the Class Priest, so I'm even more of a target for a target in the family.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Why Are You So Obsessed with Beat Performers?
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Maybe it's the same reason as Nadris?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
No matter how many people oppose it, I like it and I believe it's right.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Beat performers have a strange power that only beat performers have
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
I want everyone to know that. <cf>Beat Performers Aren't Worthless After All.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
... That's right. What I do is modest, but I believe it's meant for someone.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
I hope my dad sweater...
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Han! Nadris will be fine! <cf>He's doing his best for everyone!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Come on, let's go and report the request! <cf>If Dad is there, we'll tell him too.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Ahaha, thank you <cf>Then let's return to the Temple of Asterlies.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Nadris's Quest is complete, <cf>let's return to the Temple of Asterlies.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I have to tell them I did my job!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Great, we're here! Let's get this done right now.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Dad is...
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Good, it's wrong he's not here. <cf>I'll go and report the request right now.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Oh, you're... Nadris. <cf>I Remember You Asked the Temple for a Job
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Nadlis
Ah, Second Priest! <cf>My father is always available for your help!
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Gim
Ugh! Why are you tired?!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Glenn-san? Ah, by any chance... <cf>Gim-san, is he your older brother?
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
...
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
I've heard about it from Treymon. <cf>Thank you for your hard work in reporting the request. Nadris-kun
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Nadlis
If you are late, your family will be happy. <cf>You Can Go Home Now for Today.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Nadlis
Um... Yes I'll be off then. <cf>Mr. Glen, Adventurer.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Gim
It's been a while since we last saw each other, Glenn. <cf>Are you doing your job well?
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Shut up. I'm not bothering my brother.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Adventurer. Glen is under my care. <cf>Is your brother up to no good?
?
Npc_Gim
Player
I didn't! <cf>What the hell, you're trying to get through to my friend!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Beat Performers are Great Adventurers! <cf>There's nothing wrong about that!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
I have no doubts of criticizing beat performers. <cf>But I must question your attitude.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
For People with Strong Performers views like ours, The New Appearance of Beat Performers is willing to accept.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Feeling it is a small joke, there are some within the cult who thinks like that. <cf>Glenn, you are aware of that too.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
But even so, you're going to continue as a beat performer?
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Yeah, no matter what happened says, I'm not going to stop! <cf>I'll make my brother shampoo me!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
You're still struggling that? <cf>What a helpless guy
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
If you keep looking at things that narrowly, the <cf>way people look at you will never change.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
... Sorry, I felt you felt something wrong about my family.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I completed the request, so I had nothing but satisfied for you. <cf>Please join me again next time if you like.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I was so pissed off. Next time I'll pick a request from the cult and <cf>find it all right!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! I can't just let it go! <cf>I'll shut up my brother and the people around me with my results!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I'll prepare it again, so give me a call! <cf>thank you!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
[PATH]552*\Scenario\CAV107_005.uasset[PATH]
Han! I've been waiting for this! <cf>I just got a big request!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
<cf>The Bafaria Cult has asked you to guard a pilgrim group and kill monsters.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It lies that monsters escapes near the Pilgrim's route. <cf>I was told to slay them if possible while leaving the pilgrims.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It feels like they can't be sure what will come out, but <cf>as long as you're there, everything will be fine!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It loved that my brother and Nadris' father were also married in the pilgrimage.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Nadris said he'd go with us. <cf>He said he'd also be resurrected plants and other things along the way.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Said, it was Nadris who asked me to the request.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
<cf>He heard that the cult was looking for adventurers, and recommended us.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
The reason I was able to be able to be with such a big request may be because the Reputation of <cf>Beat Performers has solved.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It's all thanks to you for wanting me out. <cf>I'm counting on you again!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It's a chance to appeal to my big brother, Nadris' father, and the cult!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Well, first we'll meet up with the pilgrims at Lalpal. <cf>Hang on! Let's get pumped!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It's a big request from the Bafaria cult. <cf>It's a great chance to show off your skills as a beat performer!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
My brother and Nadris' father are here too, so let's show them what we can do.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
First, we'll meet up with the pilgrims at Lalpal. <cf>Come on, let's get this over with!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Gi, Gim-san! Are you OK!?
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Gim
Ugh...!
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Nadlis
Oh, it's okay, it's nothing serious. <cf>I NEED TO CALL SOMEONE MORE THAN THAT...!
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Nadlis
Nadris! And brother! What's long!?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Hey! brother! <cf>What's with that shampoo!?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Glenn-san! Adventurers too! <cf>Umm, that's, uh, monsters...!
?
Npc_Nadlis
Player
On the Way Here, The Pilgrim Group Was Supposed by a “Flame Horn”!
?
Npc_Nadlis
Player
Thanks to Mr. Gim's guidance, we were able to escape this is far...
?
Npc_Nadlis
Player
My boyfriend aren't that bad. <cf>I'm more scared about those who got scared from me during the attack.
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Treymon in relaxation has relaxation in the relaxation direction from the village. <cf>We must search for him immediately...!
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Nadris's dad!?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Well, sorry... yes
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Okay. Let's go help right away.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Wait, Glenn! The Flame Horn is a dangerous monster. <cf>And you hate Treymon, don't you?
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Treymon is the same. Just because you're a beat performer, he talks bad things of you...
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
<span size="Big">Who cares about that!?! </>
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
It's true that I don't like that old man Treymon. But that doesn't matter now!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
If something is bad, I'll come and help! <cf>I'm an Adventurer and a Beat Performer!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
If You Don't Like Them, That's Fine. <cf>You Can Start Arguing After You Get Back Alive!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
Glenn...
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
I'll bring you back soon. <cf>Just wait, Nadris.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Nadlis
Yes! <cf>Please take good care of my father!
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Glen
Okay, let's go! partner! <cf>There must be an old man standing on “God's Desperate Hill”!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Treymon is Shocking Daredevil in the “God's Hills”
?
Npc_Gim
Player
There are “Flame Horns” and Other Monsters Around. <cf>Please rescue them as soon as possible.
?
Npc_Gim
Player
But that stubborn Glenn would willingly work for someone he didn't like...
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Maybe I need to change my mind too
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Hey, Treymon! <cf>Are you still alive?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
WH-what?! I thought help was coming, but it's you guys!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
Are you doing me being a teenager? <cf>Things Don't Always Go As Planned!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
That's enough if you can be so forthright. <cf>Did you twist your leg? Let me see.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Hey, don't touch me! <cf>I'm not going to take care of a beat performer!
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
Nothing good ever happened when you're sleeping with beat performers. <cf>My Daughter Doesn't Listen to Me, and Daughters Does Master Gim.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
What's long with you? It's nothing to do with you.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
What are you dreaming to be? <cf>You must have been the one who gave the idea to GIM-sama.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
Mr. Gim often speaks out in Defense of Adventurers, especially Beat Performers.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
Because of this, even among conservatives, the way they view beat performers is changing day by day.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
The reason why I asked this request to a beat performer was because of GIM-sama's motivation.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
that guy? <cf>I've never heard anything about that.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
You Always Like Me “Change Your Attitude”
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
...
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
[--] I Don't Care about My Brother for Now. <cf>I need to do something about the old man.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Leave me alone! Even if I help you, I won't be tired to you, Beat Performer!
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
If you don't like me, that's fine, but <cf>don't make Nadris worry.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Just because you don't like beat performers isn<cf>'t it a different story to cause trouble for your daughter?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Grrr...
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
I'm going to take you home, even if you don't want to or lose. <cf>It's not for us, it's because of my promise to Nadris.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
...
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
It looks like Treymon's old man can't walk. <cf>In that case, we have to do something about “Flame Horn”
?
Npc_Glen
Player
If you come across “Enkaku” while leaving an old man who can move, you'll be out of control.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Okay! First, let's put the “Flame Horn” and ensure safety. <cf>I'll take Treymon after that.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
So, old man! We're off, so <cf>you just stay here soon.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
... “Enkaku” is on “God's Watchful Hill”. <cf>If you can do it, try it.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
If you're really going to subjugate us, <cf>I'll at least listen.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
Han! Don't look so serious! <cf>Let's go!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
“Enkaku” claims “God's Hill” as its territory. <cf>If you look for it, you'll find it.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
I'm here as I was told. <cf>I'm nothing but a hindrance
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
... If you have truly wanted the “Flame Horn,” then I will at least be willing to listen.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
I hate it, it's “Enkaku”
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Sorry. I never thought I'd have to deal with such a troublesome guy.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
If it were me before, I would have made a fuss about it being a chance to show off my beat performance.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I'm not in the mood for that right now. <cf>I think I have to fight, believe of that.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
It feels like there are people like My Brother and Nadris who believes in us.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
The answer to that is what a true beat performer is like.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Yeeeesss! <cf>Let's make our sound resonate for real!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Here we go, “Enkaku”! Get ready!!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Han! I did it!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Now the Pilgrims can rest easy. <cf>The monsters around them will be a little calmer.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Oh man, if I'd been alone it would have been ever awful. <cf>Thanks for having you there!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
When I think that I can fight even against “Enkaku,” <cf>I feel a little more tired.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Oops, this is not the time to talk. <cf>I was still in the middle of the request!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's go back to Treymon for now. <cf>I need to take him to Ralpal.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's go back to Treymon's place. <cf>I can't leave him alone.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I hope this time you'll be quiet and listen to what I have to say <cf>
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey, old man! <cf>I've got the 'Flame Horn'!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Are your legs okay? <cf>If so, let's talk to Lalpal.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
I can't believe that beat performers like you guys... <cf>That “Enkaku”...
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
Han! That was a piece of cake!
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
... That's an excuse. Because we want to be together.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Isn't it also one of the teachings of the Bafarian lying to hold hands when in trouble?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
The old man is tired and can't walk, so <cf>he'll have to lose on us for now.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
... Yes, let's do that. <cf>I'm the one who does not teach God's teachings.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Glen
Take me to Ralpal. <cf>I must inform Gim and Nadris that I am safe.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
To the two adventurers, please take care of us.
?
Npc_Tramon
Player
Han! That's easy. Leave it to me.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Tramon
Now, let's go back to Lalpal! <cf>Wow, I Can Go Home Feeling Refreshed!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Let's take Treymon to Ralpal
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I've felt 'Engaku', so I can go home feeling refreshed!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I think I can give some good news to my brother and Nadris. <cf>Han! I feel great!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Adventurer, Glenn! I hope you're safe!
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Dad, I'm glad...! I was pregnant about you.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
I'm sorry for the bad, Mr. Gim. <cf>Thank you for sleeping my daughter.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Gim
I was also able to return thanks to the help of the two beat performers.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Gim
May the God of Buffalia Bless You, and Thank You for Your Feelings.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Gim
Oh, I see. That was a disaster.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Tramon
You may also be tired. <cf>You should rest for now with Nadris.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Tramon
Let's go, Dad
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
Nadris. I once felt up an instrument. <cf>I Admired the Spirits at the Star Spirit Festival.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I WOULD SPEND THE WHOLE DAY MUSIC, THRATISHING MY HORIZONS.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
Eh?! D-Dad?!
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
But I Lacked the Talent, The Will to Follow My Own Path, and The Desire to Play for Someone Else.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
I guess I was feeling selfish you and the beat performers
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
It woke me up. <cf>I think music has a wonderful power.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
In the mood... the melody performed by the beat performers should give people a strong push forward.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
You and I should learn from him. <cf>Let's talk a bit over there.
?
Npc_Tramon
Npc_Nadlis
Uh, yeah
?
Npc_Nadlis
Npc_Tramon
Well, then, we're here. <cf>Expecting me, everyone.
?
Npc_Nadlis
Player
It was the first time Treymon had trouble like that. <cf>Maybe he had a change of heart.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Glen. And Adventurer-san. <cf>You did a great job, including defeating the “Flame Horn”.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Especially Glenn. You're Not Asking the Little Brother I Imagineed You to Be.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Han, you're the one. <cf>You're not a strict idiot, are you?
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
You Were Supposed to Be the Beat Performers. <cf>You're stingy if you don't say anything.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
From now on, please be my ally. <cf>... we're brothers.
?
Npc_Glen
Npc_Gim
I never thought I'd hear such words from your mouth.
?
Npc_Gim
Npc_Glen
Adventurer. I would like to thank you again. <cf>Thank you for sleeping younger my brother
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Thanks to you, people will look at beat performers in a whole new way.
?
Npc_Gim
Player
Han! really! <cf>You believe us your skills as a beat performer.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
You're a great guy! <cf>I'm not being able to be your friend
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Thank you for your relaxation support! <cf>Let's make our sound resonate all over the world!
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Hey! Are you sounding good today?
?
Npc_Glen
Player
I'm also asking out various requests. <cf>Han! It's relaxing and fun.
?
Npc_Glen
Player
Desired I Get Requests from My Brother, Nadris, and Old Man Treymon.

Npc_Glen

If we have a chance, let's do it together again! <cf>I'm looking forward to the session with you!

Okay, so I'd like to jump right in and ask [--], <cf>what kind of energy boosting foods are available around here?
K
Npc_Feste
Player
First, let's ask the discussion around here.
K
Npc_Feste
Player
Hey merchant! <cf>Do you know any food around here that will give me energy?
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
Food That Feels You Energy? <cf>Hmm, well...
K

Npc_Feste
If You Want a Drink, How About “Jagade”? <cf>It's a relaxing drink
K
Npc_merchant
Npc_Feste
Feeling I'm out of it now, but it<cf>'s great for sleeping Stamina
K
Npc_merchant
Npc_Feste
If you can bring us the shampoo “Jag fruit”, we'll give you a relaxing drink!
K
Npc_merchant
Npc_Feste
I see... <cf>Thank you, merchant!
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant

K
Npc_Feste

I hope this gift will cheer up Elinze a little
K
Npc_Feste
Player

K
Npc_Feste
Player
... I'm really sorry to have to say this,
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
If it's too hard on you, <cf>why not just go back to your own time?
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Shouldering this was the only option, it meant that erinze-sama was shouldering a greater threat than expected.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
... It is true that it is a little tough, but <cf>if we feel about something like this, we won't be able to save the planet.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
But...
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Hey, Tillis. <cf>You know, right?
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
I have never been outside before.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris

K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
So, even though it's been this long, I'm really happy to be here.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
Really, it's so... <cf>I can't believe the sky is so beautiful...
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
When I chose from Bachelard, I never would have Imagineed it...
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
... Oh, you're right. <cf>Indeed... it's very beautiful...
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
This Sky Thoughts Into Our Time and Even Into the Future

Npc_Aerinse

I NOW FEEL ONCE AGAIN THAT IT IS MY MISSION TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD FOREVER
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
So, I chose your thoughts, but I loved you accepted your thoughts to just go home.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
... I'm tired. <cf>If that is Lady Elinze's wish,
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
I, Tilis, Swear to You That I Will Help You Even at the Risk of My Life.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
No. Your life comes first.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
However [--]
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
If you die first, <cf>I'll follow you.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
Uh...!
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Really... <cf>If I just listen to others, it'll be just another lovers' quarrel.
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
what?! A love story...?! <cf>No! I mean, why are you tired?!
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
I heard it, so I guess it can't be sad. <cf>Decide, here, let's do this.
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
What is this...?
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
I and this guy prepared it. It makes you feel better that drink it will make you feel better. <cf>... I was pregnant if it would be good for Elinze.
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Well, thank you!
K
Npc_Aerinse
Unknown
... Well, what can I say? You've come to this era. <cf>I think it's good to relax and have a little fun.
K
Npc_Feste
Unknown
If you just get too serious about it, you'll run out of steam. <cf>right?
K
Npc_Feste
Unknown
Served it was a coven, my servant and I had joined the group. <cf>You Two Are No Longer Alone
K
Npc_Feste
Unknown
... thank you. <cf>I feel that I have loved one more good thing about living room in this era.
K
Npc_Aerinse
Unknown
I'm happy to have more regrets. <cf>Here, Tyris. Give it to Erinze to drink.
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Ugh...! I'm still not used to be loved like a servant, but <cf>I'll be loved for the gifts.
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Yes, I'll give you the market price as a thank you ♪
K
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
what?! Do you charge money?!
K
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Oh, how much is it? <cf>I wonder if this gem will be enough...

Npc_Aerinse

You don't have to pay, Elinze-sama! <cf>Delayed, that's clearly too much!

Npc_Aerinse

Erinze-sama, please don't leave my side
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Tiris. If Elinze clings to you any more, you'll be tired to walk<cf>.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
...
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Hey, haven't you been a little too tense up this whole time?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
IT'S NERVE WRACKING TO WATCH. <cf>You Don't Want to Make Your Teammates Feel Uncomfortable Tense, Do You?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
... I'm sorry. I have a bad feeling about this.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
I believe that you are being sensitive about Avaritia, but <cf>we are there, so don't be so afraid.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
That's right, Tyris. <cf>Don't carry too much on your own...
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
I'm sorry <cf>But I'm Lady Erinze's bodyguard.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Even if I have the help of my injuries, <cf>I can't let my guard down.

Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
I am here only to protect Lady Elinze.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse

Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
It explains that the Avaritia in question is no doubt around here. Let's relax on.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
... Tiris, Omnistron!
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Aerinse
[--]! Yes!
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
What's long? I can't see Avaritia around...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
This presence... Maybe Tyris' bad feeling was right.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
What is this...?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Lady Elinze, this is... <cf>VoldiGen's trace!
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
As expected...
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
The Dragon King?! <cf>he was here?!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Yes These marks are the marks left by Voldigen eating Avaritia.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Oh, hey, are you okay?! <cf>If he's still nearby, this time we'll [--]
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Please stay calm. <cf>Relaxation, there is no reaction from the Voldigen body.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
What are the spirits of other Avaritia?
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
There is one a little distance away from here
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Looking at the traces... it seems that Voldigen and two Avaritias appear here.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
So, one was tired... <cf>The other one escaped to have escaped.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
... Is that one heading leading the highway ahead?
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
Yes, we are sorry redirecting you there.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
This is not surprising a case of waiting and seeing. <cf>Let's shampoo make a detour!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
After FIGHTING THE DRAGON KING, Avaritia MUST BE IN A STATE OF CONTROL RIGHT NOW AND OUT OF CONTROL!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
But the people on the road...!
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
... In this case, you should leave the fleeing Avaritia.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
ok!? <cf>You, what you said before is different!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
I'm sorry <cf>But in a way, this could be an opportunity.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
what? What do you mean?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
I believe that Voldigen is powerful strength by devoured Avaritia...
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Even Avaritia has levels. <cf>There's no point in just eating small fry.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
If Voldigen had come all the way to eat him, then the fleeing Avaritia must have been pretty strong...
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
I can't let Voldigen gather his strength like this.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
I'll kill him before he tries again
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
No, no! Even the Dragon King is Nowhere to Be Seen, It's Dangerous to Approach a Shocking Beast!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
First of all, isn't it your duty to protect Elinze?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
If Voldigen gains any more power, <cf>he will soon be able to protect Lady Elinze.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
It would be wise to reduce your strength here and now.
?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Uuuh... you have a point... but...

Okay. I'll do as Tiris says.

But when God's [angel] was angry, <cf>'anger' was not dangerous.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
At that time, the [angels] were also sleeping peacefully, and there was no need to set up a barrier.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Something must have Piqued the Angel's Anger. <cf>Angry He Feels Angry and Angry Us
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
[The Angel] was also linked to the “Wrath of God,” and <cf>we were forced to leave the Cathedral. [--]
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Lord Einrain has overcome to create a barrier from here to calm the angels.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I see...
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
If you cast a barrier far away from the target, <cf>you will lose more power.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
EinRain-sama is no exception, and <cf>is more likely than he looks.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Thanks to you, we are now able to create a barrier around the Angels, but the thoughts of knowledge up until now must have been tired.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
It would be happy if Einrein were they to kill him. <cf>Can't you do something about it?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
For now, we have you take a special medicine made by the cult to help reduce symptoms.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
The raw materials for that medicine are also running low...
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
If that's the case, we're the right people for the job. <cf>Gathering the raw materials is a piece of cake, isn't it?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Yes, leave it to me
{
Player
Npc_Ryugerio
Yes, leave it to me
{
Player
Npc_Ryugerio
You are truly blessed by God. <cf>We thank you for your spirit of service.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
We have a member of our conscience who is knowledge about pharmacology, so please ask him about the location of the raw materials.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
He would have loved the flowers near the Temple of Asterlies.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Well, then, servant. Let's head to the temple complex.
{
Npc_Feste
Player
Hey, are you the believer knowledge in pharmacology that Lugerio was talking about?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
...
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
Oh, why don't you reply? Hey!
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Shhh! ... I can't hear the voices of the flowers
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
Yes?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
THE LEAVES RUSTLE IN THE WIND... THE LEAVES RUSTLE... <cf>I can hear... the dance of the flowers...
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
A poet!
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
I just... the breath... the breath of the flowers... <cf>The voice of the green...
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
No, this guy has a quirk...!
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Okay, let's do it business-like. <cf>This is an order from your boss, Lugerio.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
We are looking for relaxation to make a special cult medicine. <cf>Please tell me what you need.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Medicine... it helps people... hope...
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
(Seems, me! Do your best!)
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
What we need now is “Skyfish Oil”... <cf>When oil and honey mix... The Flower of Life Blooms...
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
Did you hear, servant? Did you hear? That's all I need. <cf>Let's go get the raw materials!
{
Npc_Feste
Player
Medicine... It's... the light that seems out of the people's power... <cf>Please be careful when using it...
{
Npc_Pharmacy_Priest
Npc_All
So you got the raw materials. <cf>Thank you very much.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I will be gracious accept it. <cf>May the God of Baphalia Bless You.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
The Believer You Know Who Is Knowledgeable About Pharmacology, <cf>Has A Really Strange Habit...
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
I'm sorry <cf>But he's still an excellent pharmacist.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Let's get him to make the medicine right away. <cf>He should have a shampoo all the shampoo.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Hmm? Aren't these the only musicians?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
We also need to drink other herbs. <cf>However, some of them are tired.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
He can identify them and <cf>collect the spicy herbs by herbs.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
He wasn't just a poet...
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Then, please wait here for a moment. <cf>I'll bring the medicine...
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
This is the cult's special medicine. <cf>Please give it to Einrain.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
That's fine, but why don't you just go and give it to him?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
I have some business to lose to.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I see... Then, let's take this medicine to Einrain.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Yes Thank you very much.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Hey, I've given you some medicine. Can you rest for a bit?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
I just re-established the barrier, so it's okay to rest now...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
I'll take your medicine...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
It feels like a lot of work, but I need you to do your best...
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
But now that I'm close to the angels, <cf>it's a lot worse than before...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
... By the way, Einrein. <cf>It's about Carvein...
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
... Shh. In a small voice
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
... The Last Time I met Carvain in person was at Khartoum...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
“That one”... I see, so we still met in Khartoum.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
Well, if I didn't do that, I didn't have been able to borrow the Chronogram from Charlotte... Um...
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
...?
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
Oh, no, nothing. <cf>By the way, have you completed your pilgrimage?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
Pilgrimage? I Haven't Made the Pilgrimage yet...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
Because I set up a barrier here and attended the <cf>Salamzahd conference...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
meeting? Sorry, can you explain that in more detail?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
Salamzahd's meeting... Barnhardt, Salamzahd, <cf>Asterlies, and the cult held an emergency meeting between the four of them...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
With the Assassination of the Duke, Dunkirk Seduction Power... <cf>He says he will explain the future of the Dukedom to each country...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
A meeting in neutral Salamzahd...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
... Were You in Contact with <cf>Carveins Behind the Scenes?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
... <cf>It was dangerous, but he's innocent...
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
... Yes, that's right. I think so too. <cf>Carvein is a simple and honest person.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
... I WANT TO CLEAR UP YOUR SUCCESSFUL TOUCH.
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
We will also marry as much as we can. <cf>He is tired Charlotte.
{
Player
Npc_Einrain
We will also help as much as we can. <cf>He went after Charlotte after all.
{
Player
Npc_Einrain
Thank you... It's talking to hear that.
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
I'll do my best to set up a barrier. <cf>I'll have to hold back the [Angel] here...!
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
Yes, that's the spirit! <cf>But please don't push yourself too hard, okay?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
Yes...!
{
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
Well then, we should go back. <cf>We have to report to Lugerio.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
I take the medicine to Einrein. <cf>Also, I'm taking a little rest now.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Thank you <cf>Is Einrain Feeling Well?
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Ah, you're really excited!
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
I see. <cf>I'm glad I asked you for the medicine.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Now that I think about it, you had to think about it, you had to take it with you because you had other business to think about it.
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
... My role is to scold EinRain-sama.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
If I come to you when you are tired, you will become even more excited.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
In these circumstances, it's better to have someone like you who can talk casually.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
... so it was out of trouble for Einrain?
{
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Yes, she is an important Oracle maiden.
{
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Oh dear, everyone is so clumsy...

Hey Jake! <cf>How is Coin Shop running?
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Let me ask the questionable question. Does it look like it's working?
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Q
Yes, it looks like you're having trouble figuring out how to do it.
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Delicate! To be honest, it's a close call!
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Management of alcohol and food inventory, convenience procurement routes, <cf>cleaning, washing clothes, mediating drunk people...
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
No matter how top of the best I am, <cf>this guy is too much for me to handle!
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
I Can't Bring Myself to Tease You About This... <cf>Is there anything I can help you with?
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
<span size="Big">what! Decent?! </>
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Coin Pavilion is a place of rest for adventurers. <cf>I have some relaxation for it too.
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
It would be a surprise if you did something long and the business went wrong while your thoughts were away.
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
That's what I like about you, Miss Feste!
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Oh no. I don't want to help relieve.
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Don't say that. I'd like to ask you to procure some supplies. <cf>There is something important needed right now.
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
What I want is “Salamzahd's Spices Special” and “Ritze Herbs” that can be delicious in Ritze Village.
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
If you could pick up these two items from a local merchant <cf>it would be a great help to me. Would you be able to do that?
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Oh, I'll take it.
W
Player
Npc_Jake
Yes, I'll take it
W
Player
Npc_Coin_Owner
thank you! <cf>We look forward to your work!
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Stopping me, I'm from Coin Pavilion. <cf>I'm here to pick up Salamzahd's special spices!
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
Oh, I've been waiting for you. <cf>I was tired because you didn't have been in touch with me recently.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Here you go, this month's spices. Use them wrestlers.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Maybe I'll be a little less flexible from now on...
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Huh? why?
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
It's Barnhardt. <cf>He's been constantly pressuring on trade relations for a while now.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
It feels like they are being very forceful, especially not to do business with Cult members.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
You see, the cult has a strong influence in Asterlies, right? <cf>I don't know what will happen in the future.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
After the Duke was assassinated and Dunkirk killed the lead, they've become pretty hardline<cf>.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Salamzahd is neutral neutrality, but <cf>I wonder what will happen if things continue like this...
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
...
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
Oops, that was a dark story. <cf>Business should be fun. Thank you for everything!
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Sorry, this is from Coin Pavilion. <cf>I'm here to pick up some Litze Herbs!
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
Oh, you're a different person than a teenager. <cf>What happened to your father?
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
I'm away from home for a while... <cf>My Agent is running the business now.
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
Hmm, I thought I'd finally get to see my dad's face after such a long time, but unfortunately...
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Here, here's Litze's proud Litze herb. <cf>I've prepared just the amount, so take it with you.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Thank you Indeed!
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
... Are You Guys Adventurers, Right? <cf>You Travel All Over The Place, Right?
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Then have you heard that something strange has appeared to the cult within Barnhardt?
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Something strange has happened to the cult in Barnhardt...? <cf>What's that?
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
No, I just heard it from a fellow merchant. <cf>It's all being oppressed or whatever...
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
But the Weird Thing is that this isn't even being present about in Asterlies.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Well, Asterlies is a city of free trade, but the influence of the cult is strong. That may be a factor.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
... do you know anything else?
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
That's right. Ah... there is talk that the knight who assassinated the sovereign, <cf>Carvain, is connected to the cult.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
<cf>Then it makes sense that carvein feels here?
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
If that's the case, the assassination of the sovereign was the work of the cult... <cf>[--] Just kidding! Well, it's all just relaxation.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
...
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_merchant
Well then, say hello to my substitute shampoo. <cf>I'd be happy if he was a cool dad.
W
Npc_merchant
Npc_All
Great! You dressed the goodies. <cf>thank you!
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Now, all that's left is to prepare this according to my father's secret recipe [--]
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Hey, Jake. I didn't really care...
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
In recent months, relations between the countries have become strained...
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Hmm? Ah... the international shower is sleeping getting shady.
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
(It explains that this is different from the history we know...)
W
Npc_Feste
Player
Adventurers in the Future, Adventurers May Be Called Upon to Use Their Military Power.
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
The Appearance of <cf>Uncouth Guys has become more common in Asterlies.
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
... war, huh?
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Well, I don't know, I don't know. But [--]
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
For that reason, I think we must not lose this place of rest.
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
You... think that far...
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Hmph... well, yeah. And [--]
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
If She Sees This Feeling Side of Me Running the Store, <cf>Her Heart Might Heat Up Too! ?
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Oh, you're thinking that...
W
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
HAHAHA! There's nothing that the top of the top Jake can't do! Get customers and girlfriends!!
W
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
In a way, I'm relieved that you haven't changed...
W

Oh, you guys... <cf>You're dying of Shar, right?
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader

I am the leader of the troupe that employs her. Thank you for your favorite her.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
Y
By the way, are you guys pretty close to <cf>Charles?
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
I don't know much about him, but <cf>I've tried him a few times.
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
I see, that's right. So then...
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
Do you know where that child is...?
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
That's... sorry, <cf>we don't have any details...
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Is that so? No, don't worry about it. <cf>That's a strange thing to ask.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
Have you heard from Charlotte?
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Yes Nothing Since Those Strange Guys Had Me <cf>I left a note I was going away for a while...
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
... That child always wanted things to happen so I'm leaving about her.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
The reason he left us must be because he was afraid that one of his members had been afraid because he was the target of the attack.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
I wonder if he's safe now... <cf>I wonder if he's eating snacks...
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
As a parent figure, I'm so excited... ugh...!
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
Well, I think it's okay. <cf>We should have some friends who are with us.
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
what?! what?!
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
As I said before, I don't know where she went, but <cf>Charlotte is with someone I can trust.
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
So, don't worry too much [--]
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
So, then, <cf>could you have been able to get in touch with Shar?
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
Huh? Um, well, <cf>maybe it's possible...?
_
Npc_Feste
Npc_Troupe_Leader
please! <cf>Please go and find out what's going on with Shar!
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
I chose that she was leaving her distance from us. If that's the case, then at least let us know how she is.
_

It's about Charlotte. <cf>Is it possible to get in touch with her?

Thank you <cf>I feel relieved what feels like to that child.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
I guess they're trying not to make us worry. <cf>They're arguing their best and having fun...
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
... That child has no real parents. <cf>He was born an injured child and joined the troupe when he was about 10 years old.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
Since then, we have raised her as if she were our own daughter.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
But... I also know that she talks to meet her real parents.
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
I Want to Help Her Realize Her Dream Feels Tough, But She Just Feels Too Tough...
_
Npc_Troupe_Leader
Npc_All
[--] Shame, I think I'll leave it up to her to lose for now.

Yes Charles Never Does Anything Long

Oh, she's our proud daughter.

Npc_Troupe_Leader

Thank you very much for this time. <cf>Please accept my small token of convenience.

Npc_Troupe_Leader

Well, we'll be off now. <cf>I want to show the letter to others...

Hey! You look kind of laid-back, don't you? <cf>No, it must be free time. Isn't that right?
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
What, it's an aggressive flow, isn't it? <cf>Is there anything you'd like help with?
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
x
Delicate! I'm having a little trouble
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>This is a problem because I'm top of the top of the adventurers in Asterlies... huh...
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
ah, yes, yes. <cf>Being arrogant is fine, so it's better to talk quickly
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
<cf>In conclusion, I want you to take over my request
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>Currently, requests from the Bureau of Development have been reduced due to the fact that they are away from home here...
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>A client who didn't know that asked me to “Jake no matter what,”
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
This and all of this is due to my ability. <cf>Oh, I hate my talents...!
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>[--] That's why I want you guys to take requests on my behalf
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>If it's a junior I keep an eye on, my client will be convinced
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
... well, if that's the case
~
Player
Npc_Jake
... well, if that's the case
~
Player
Npc_Jake
If it were addressed to the Lord, the request fee would probably be reasonable. There's also a thank you for taking care of <cf>this place
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Thank you! <cf>Well then, let me briefly explain the details of the request
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
The client is Reverend Walkin from Minsterhorn
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
that loud priest? <cf>Has he gone missing again?
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
It's not far even if it doesn't get hit, is it? <cf>The person who went missing was my apprentice Millaine
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
millaine... <cf>Oh, I'm sure there was a female apprentice wearing glasses. is that
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
do you know that? If that's the case, it's time to talk!
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>It seems that the apprentice hasn't come back for 6 more days since his search for “Dragon Claw Marks”
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
<cf>Since they said [“] I'll be back in 2 or 3 days [”], it seems that Priest Walkin also became really worried
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
My mentor used to be missing, and now he's my apprentice? <cf>they're similar teachers and pupils...
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
<cf>For the most part, just like my mentor, my curiosity has won out and I can't see my surroundings
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
That's because I'm personally cared for by Priest Walkin. <cf>This is one, please take care of me!
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
That's fine, I was asked to. That's because a <cf>priest isn't on a relationship that even the eagles don't know
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Well, my servant, I'm off to search for Millaine!
~
Npc_Feste
Player
I wonder if it's behind here that Millaine disappeared...
~
Npc_Feste
Player
...? it's my servant. Couldn't <cf>you hear anything just now?
~
Npc_Feste
Player
I wonder if it's an eagle's misunderstanding? but [--]
~
Npc_Feste
Player
It's not a misunderstanding. Something's happening! I'm <cf>in a hurry, servant!!
~
Npc_Feste
Player
Servant, don't these broken glasses look familiar?
~
Npc_Feste
Player
these glasses are definitely...
~
Player
Npc_Feste
-- huh!
~
Player
Npc_Feste
these glasses are definitely...
~
Player
Npc_Feste
-- huh!
~
Player
Npc_Feste
... Hmm, it's probably Millaine's. <cf>What's more... there are traces of blood all around
~
Npc_Feste
Player
well, she... no way...
~
Player
Npc_Feste
well, she... no way...
~
Player
Npc_Feste
<cf>I want them to stay alive emotionally, but it must be difficult in this situation...
~
Npc_Feste
Player
that kind of...
~
Player
Npc_Feste
that kind of...
~
Player
Npc_Feste
... there are things like this in the adventurer business
~
Npc_Feste
Player
I'm going back to the coin tei with my glasses. I have to report it to <cf>Jake...
~
Npc_Feste
Player
... I see. Was it the sound of wind passing through a <cf>gap
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
<cr>An eagle who thought it was a scream or something is a total clown isn't it

Npc_Feste

Player
Npc_Feste
Hey! thank you for your hard work. Have you <cf>found Millaine?
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
... if it's just broken glasses, huh
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
That is...
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
...
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
... ah, I see. that kind of thing, huh
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Sorry, I made a bunch of requests that had a bad aftertaste. I'll explain it to the <cf>priest
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
I'm sorry
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
<cf>If the girl at the festival looks like a bookmark, her condition will go wrong, so stop it
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
I'm just... sorry, but I'd like you to explain the situation in detail. There's <cf>also a report to the Bureau of Development
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Oh, that's right. First [--]
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
I'm so sorry! Is Jake here?
~
Unknown
Npc_Jake
what?
~
Npc_Feste
Unknown
oh?
~
Npc_Jake
Unknown
ah...!?
~

It looks like the teacher was in a hurry and asked me to search. <cf>I'm really sorry!
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
<span size="Big">I'm alive!? </>
~
Npc_All
Npc_Milene
huh? yeah, they're alive though?? <cf>I was doing well today and the meal was delicious starting in the morning, wasn't it?
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
That was good... not why!? <cf>Lord, these are broken glasses! Among the ruins!!
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
Oh, did you guys pick it up for me? <cf>thank you! But they made a new one, didn't they
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
the new one...?
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
yeah. Well, I was really upset this time. <cf>I fell in the ruins and broke my glasses
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
Do you know the feeling of hopelessness when a nearsighted person loses his glasses? What's more, I have a <cf>nose bleed from a bang in the face. It was already really painful
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
<cf>So, I asked an adventurer who was passing by to take me to the Asterlies
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
But you can't do anything without glasses, right? <cf>That's why I stayed locked in until a new one was made
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
<cf>Oh... and during that time, a priest who was worried about not being contacted sent a request to me
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_Milene
Seems like it. I'm really sorry. <cf>the teacher is also in trouble because of his anxiety
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
<cf>Huh... I'm glad he was safe, but Lord, I can't talk about Walkin
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
<cf>If you don't want to worry, don't go exploring alone from now on
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
<cf>Do you know how we felt when we found these broken glasses? huh?
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
Wow... that's right. As a result, I'm wasting my feet. <cf>I'm sorry... I should have contacted you earlier...
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
From now on, I'll try not to go exploring alone as much as possible. <cf>... as much as possible, right
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
<cf>If you feel like that, you don't seem to feel like stopping exploring alone, right?
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
Of course! <cf>We won't stop until we solve the mystery of a super ancient civilization!!
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
is it a super ancient civilization... <cf>Is it different from the Bavarian civilization?
~
Player
Npc_Milene
it's a super ancient civilization... <cf>Is it different from the Bavarian civilization?
~
Player
Npc_Milene
<span size="Big">Great for listening!! </>
~
Npc_Milene
Player
<cf>Oh, I feel like I've hit a switch I don't need, doesn't it?
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
Do you know strata? strata. <cf>It's essential when it comes to doing history, though. What is on top is newer and below
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
<cf>It means it's about old, but if you go with this, it will be civilized to strata about 15,000 years before the Bavarian ruins
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
There is evidence that it was there. <cf>So, it was a civilization that developed far further than it is now, or rather, it was such a super advanced civilization that I couldn't understand
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
there are signs. Yes, these glasses, for example! Isn't it true that something <cf>of the same shape has been discovered in that stratum!?
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
Well, it seems that the super ancient ones were even more functional. There seems to have been a lot of <cf>ingenuity with lenses in particular, so this lens
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
Hey... how long is this going to last...?
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
I wonder if it's about the same as Walkin...
~
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
ah... yeah... that's right...
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Hey, are you listening? <cf>So it's a lens, but apparently it was devised so that images float directly
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
Wow, that's amazing
~
Player
Npc_Milene
Wow, that's amazing
~
Player
Npc_Milene
Lord, what are you properly accepting and answering! <cf>At this rate, there are further explanations [--]
~
Npc_Feste
Player
isn't it? that's amazing, isn't it!? <cf>Well, it seems that this super ancient civilization also had a mechanism where everything worked automatically
~
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
Well, I have a purchase, so I ordered the rest. <cf>Goodbye!
~
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Don't run away! Take the eagle with you too!! <cf>No, please take me Jake!!!

Npc_Feste

Don't turn it on only at times like this! I'm running away!!

I don't think it's something I should do. <cf>I'm still incapable and not cut out to be a leader.

Before I escaped it, I had forcibly escaped to Kanaloa under the pretext of an inspection...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
Yes! Thanks to you, it was a lot of fun!

Npc_Carvain
Npc_Trouble_Woman
Oh, what a gentleman!
v
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
I'm just wondering what Dunkirk said.
v
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
Ah, well... <cf>The truth is, we're having trouble finding the orphanage...
v
Npc_Trouble_Woman
Npc_Carvain
Until now, we have been eating food with the help of the relaxation organization.
v
Npc_Trouble_Woman
Npc_Carvain
After that incident, the cult had a hard time rebuilding trouble, and <cf>it didn't even have the resources to look after the orphanage...
v
Npc_Trouble_Woman
Npc_Carvain
I wanted that you wanted to make money, but <cf>we can't buy at a loss either.
v
Npc_Peddler
Npc_All
Um, what about government support?
v
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Trouble_Woman
It's not just the children of the Principality, so <cf>formal support is...

Ah... hahaha... that's good, yeah
v
Npc_Feste
Npc_Trouble_Woman
This is a strange matter... <cf>I need to report this to the sovereign and have him take action.
v
Npc_Carvain
Npc_All
If I, a “hero,” make a ruling to the sovereign, the civil society will not be able to ignore it.
v
Npc_Carvain
Npc_All
... That's right. I can't run away from being a “hero”. I have to do what I can as a “hero”!
v
Npc_Carvain

Unlike my dad, I don't get tired. <cf>... I see.

Hey, I think these girls would be more likely to get in touch with you than with your dad, right?

Yes?

Hey Jake. Who's this...?

Sorry for the late greeting. I'm an old friend of the relatives here [--] or, the <cf>previous thoughts?

Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
I Haven't Seen You in a Few Years. <cf>I was curious to hear that the owner of Coin-tei had changed.

Npc_Host_Friend

I thought something had trouble, so I came here.

Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
his old friend...?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Host_Friend
An old fellow adventurer. We made a killing together until he died this coin shop.
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
This shop was an adventure here when I visited an adventurer. It's been a long time since my dad was even an active member.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Host_Friend
That's right... I Started Adventuring with Him about 30 years ago. I was still young then.
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
I see... Hey, what was your ex like?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Host_Friend
Huh? That was a damn cheeky one!
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
He just wanted up in Asterlies. <cf>He beat me up while we were fighting in the street.
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
He was naive and had a strangely arrogant tone. His sword was beautiful, so I thought he must have been a runaway rich boy from beautiful.
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
Then he said he wanted to be an adventurer, so I went along with him as a test of college...
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
So before I bought it, this coin shop had been built.
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
No, that's skipping too much. <cf>Please give me more details... or something that might give me a glimpse into their senses!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Host_Friend
Hahaha! Well, just think of me and that guy as well as us as we just ran through our 20s like idiots.

Npc_Host_Friend

But if he is tired, <cf>he is also tired, that guy...

Npc_All

Npc_Feste
Npc_Host_Friend
Are you regulars here?

Npc_Host_Friend

We Are Regulars... My Beginners Feels Me Up, and Then I Regulates Him Up.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Host_Friend
Now that I think about it, I heard you feel up a girl a few years ago... Oh, it was you.

Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
Are you lonely now that he's gone?
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
N-no? <cf>I'm a smart and gorgeous beautiful girl who can handle it on my own!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Host_Friend
That's clever... Well, my dad also said his stamp of approval about the filthy nature of money.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Host_Friend
Ahahaha! That's great! <cf>It's important to survive!
?
Npc_Host_Friend
Npc_All
Hmm, believe your reaction is similar to My Husband's. <cf>I guess they're like each other. They're not worth eating.

You Still Have Friends Who Can't Eat As Much As Me? <cf>That's right...

Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
Oh, that's fine. <cf>I just want to hear his old stories.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Ruth
I was curious if there was any incident story that could give me some insight into your senses.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ruth
Hehe, what's that? <cf>I know quite a bit about it.
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
We went on adventures together, and we were pretty good friends at one time... right?
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
If it's Feste-chan, who he loves, then I might talk to her. It would be a way to get revenge for her tired face.
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
By All Means! It's okay, I'll hate you.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ruth
Well... Maybe the Land Fox ripped his pants and he wears Asteria Plain in just his clothes?
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
Also, he slipped and fell into a pile of <cf>Uribo dung...
?
Npc_Ruth

That relaxation! I wanted to see it with my own eyes!

Npc_Feste
Npc_Ruth
Hehe, it would be a story to only tell you someone stories, so I'll have to tell you some good stories too.
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
He's a very narrowly oriented guy. <cf>He's really cared about his younger brother who he left behind in his wife.

An old adventure story. <cf>["] My Younger Brother Likes This Kind of Thing ["]
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
Younger brother...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ruth
He was friendly and had many friends, but he didn't talk much about emotions, so I remember his younger brother's story well.
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
That's right, he was busy at that time, so <cf>I felt to send it on his favorite.
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
... Do you remember the address?

Npc_Feste
Npc_Ruth
I think it was someone called Helge from Kanaloa. <cf>If you're curious about him, why don't you ask him?
?
Npc_Ruth
Npc_All
Are you going?

Npc_Feste

?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All

Grrr...! That thief...!

Npc_Feste

This is wonderful. These are people leaving the king had high motivation for. <cf>So, as sorry, let's talk about old times.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
Please keep it brief
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Helge
Well, that depends on this old man's mood. <cf>Hohohoho

Npc_Helge
Npc_All
First of all, who are you?
?
Player
Npc_Helge
First of all, who are you?
?
Player
Npc_Helge
I was proud the tutor to the sovereign. <cf>When he left the castle, I was no longer needed.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
Left the castle...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Helge
... That person was a twin.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
THE YOUNGER TWIN BROTHER WAS RAISED IN CONFINEMENT TO SERVE AS HIS OLDER BROTHER'S BODY DOUBLE.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
But the older brother lambs this. <cf>The Younger Brother was better than him...
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
My brother didn't want to be king. <cf>So [--]
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
He chose the castle just before ascending to the throne. <cf>To hand over the throne to his younger brother who was in the shadows...
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
The rest is history for you guys, right?
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
... while working as an adventurer in Asterlies, I set up a coin shop...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Helge
Because it would be troublesome to leave his own blood behind, the older brother stuck to his own life and tired out his younger brother.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
Because of that, his younger brother's reign was younger siblings...
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
My wife and child were taken hostage by the <cf>Drava Royal Research Institute, which was secretly but surprisingly influential.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
My younger brother was born to do something about it, but in the end he was born a puppet of the research institute.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
He was dying by Dunkirk, who was burning with Revenge for his son...
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
So, the couple got back together. <cf>I chose the story, but...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Helge
... You look like you're not pregnant?
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
If You Wish to Speak to the Duke Banter, I Can Put You Through. Is that okay?
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
PLEASE. I want to talk to him.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Helge
Okay. <cf>Then go to Barnhardt Castle.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
I'm sure he would also like to talk to you.
?
Npc_Helge
Npc_All
You're here. I've heard the story from Helge.
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
Jake has taken over the coin shop. <cf>I'm relieving I'm sure he'll do a good job.
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
... Your old friend came to the coin shop. <cf>I was pregnant about you.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
It was Ruth from Ralpal who told me about Helge. She told me to tell him he was an idiot.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
She's still as strict as ever.
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
... Are you OK with this?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
Huh?
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
Do You Wish to Decide the Business You Built in Asterlies and Live as a Prince from Now On?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
Are you going to just throw everything away without leaving the truth to your regular customers or your friends?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
Are you going to make everything you have to do with your own power never <cf>forget to make!?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
I can't bear that question
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
... I had no desire to be a king. <cf>I Wanted to Become an Adventurer and Live on My Own.
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
It wasn't just me, but my imprisoned younger brother too... <cf>He was also having the same dream.
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
But I had another advantage of the fact that I had another self, <cf>and totally everything on her and ran away
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
30 years. <cf>For 30 years, younger my brother put up with my whims.
?
Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
If that's the case, then maybe it's my turn to go out with her.
?

The people would be happy if they found out that the sovereign had been rejected. <cf>This is a secret, okay?

Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
... Okay. I'll keep quiet.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
But in return I want hush money

Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
I agree. So how much do you want?

The Hush Money is for Barnhardt's information

Feels like this... <cf>I want you to tell me the information explanation

Npc_Feste
Npc_Norbert
Feste...

Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
... To get the sovereign to reveal information, that's a pretty steep price to pay.

Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
Okay, let's do that. okay?

Npc_Norbert
Npc_All
Oh, of course!

Well, that's not it. Don't wander around so much. <cf>Do you know what you're up to?

The Matter with That Armed Group hasn't been resolved yet. <cf>You Never Know When You Might Be Wrong

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Uh... I'm sorry <cf>But this time, there's something that I'm really curious about.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
I Came Here Because I Heard Some Thought That It Might Be Related to That Armed Group.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
what...?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
I heard at the coin shop. <cf>Recently, there's been a bandit who's been targeting only talented performers.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
But even though they're called bandits, they don't hate anything. <cf>It seems like they're targeting the musicians performers musicians.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
I wanted to hear from other people too, so I came here too...
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Could that be a bandit...?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
From what I've heard in conversations, <cf>they've been talking to the ones targeting me.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Wait, wait, wait. IT'S TOO EARLY TO DRAW TOO DRAWING.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Thoughts... that's right. <cf>Servant, You and I Will Gather Some More Information.

I think I saw some amazing performers in the city. <cf>Let's go and listen to what they have to say.

Npc_Feste
Player
Charlotte, you should return to the Coin Pavilion. <cf>It's dangerous to be alone.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
No, I'll stay here and listen to some more.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Don't worry! I'm happy good friends with the staff here. <cf>If they see someone else, they'll let me know.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Huh? Before...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
A talented performer must know the tricks to get close to people.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Oh my, what a pretty girl...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Well then, I'll ask you to gather information from outside. <cf>Let's report back here later.

A QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS! <cf>Have you been visiting by Bandits recently?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_gypsy_youngman
Bandits? Ah, that's right. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ONLY TARGET US PERFORMERS, RIGHT?
?
npc_gypsy_youngman
Npc_All
Because of this, I can't even move around because of it. <cf>I have to hire guards for my safety, it's a real problem

By the way, where will it happen?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_gypsy_youngman
Hmm... I think I first heard the story near <cf>Salamzahd.
?
npc_gypsy_youngman
Npc_All
Salamzahd... I see...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste

npc_gypsy_youngman
Npc_All
That's... a bit scary.
?
Npc_Feste
npc_gypsy_youngman
Yeah. It's not normal. <cf>So it's better not to stick your nose in.
?
npc_gypsy_youngman
Npc_All
Especially cute girls. <cf>Then, if you feel like it, come and see me dance!
?
npc_gypsy_youngman
Npc_All
Hmm? Is there something I can help you with?
?
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
Yes I heard that there were bandits who only attacked dangerous performers, so I was afraid if there was any information.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Maybe you guys can get rid of them? <cf>That would be a great help.
?
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
It depends on the time and depends... I guess, hehe

Npc_Feste
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Hmm? Oh well. <cf>The Other Day, My Friend Was Assured by That Very Bandit.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
He's dead... <cf>People die so bad, don't they?

Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
That's... my condolences...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
She was a young and pretty girl. <cf>I saw the body and it was a single blow to the neck. It's dreadful.

Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
Really, taking a life is your only goal... <cf>You're not a bandit teenager, are you?
?
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
Where was your friend partner?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
According to a fellow veteran performer, they were on their way from Larpal to Minsterhorn.
?
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
That's all I know. <cf>Why don't you ask other people?
?
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
I'll try that. thank you!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Yes I wish I could, but <cf>I don't want to avenge my friend.

Npc_Gypsy_Woman
Npc_All
What the hell, you guys? <cf>If you want to see me perform, pay me!
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
Well, don't say that. I was tired if you knew anything about the bandits that had been rumored recently to be attacking suicide performers.
?
Npc_Feste
npc_gypsy_middleage
Ugh, stop it! <cf>I don't even want to remember them!
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
Eh? Uncle, did you meet bandits?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_gypsy_middleage
Oh, it was last night. <cf>It was about the border between Minster Hill and the Andorra Basin.
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
I felt someone staring at me, so I felt around and... I was standing in the darkness
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
His eyes were wide open and bloodshot red. <cf>He was dying mumbling to dying.
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
I saw his clothes and clothes that the guy he was with the bandit I had heard about. <cf>We both escaped with our lives.
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
... Didn't they attack you?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_gypsy_middleage
Now that I think of it... there was no sign of movement. <cf>I'm sure he was looking at me and muttering “man” and “no, that's not him”...
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
Oh, just think it hurts me chills. <cf>That's all for now. I'm back!
?
npc_gypsy_middleage
Npc_All
Good job! Did you get anything?
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Well, that's about it. <cf>Let's talk the information we have hate. [--]

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Bandits Don't Attack Male Performers <cf>Female performers take lives without stealing anything.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
His mental state is not normal. He is muttering, “If I don't kill, I'll be dying.”
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
The sighting was near Salamzahd, between Lalpal and Minsterhorn...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Last night, you said it was somewhere around the border between Minster Hills and the Andorra Basin.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
... I guess they are the group that was after me in Salamzahd.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
And we're getting closer and closer to this point.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
If they don't find me, the <cf>other musicians performers and everyone in the trouble won't either...!
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
That's no good! I have to do something!
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Oh dear. I like your spirit, but I also think you need to calm down.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
What would you do if you did something about it? <cf>Would You Take On An Armed Group Alone?

That Group of Armed Men Feels Me a Bad Feeling. <cf>My Horns Are Tingling Too
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Um, if you'd like to help me, <cf>can I tell you what I think?
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
From what I've heard, there aren't that many bandits. Maybe 3 or 4 at most...
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
If that's all you want, I think we can corner him in some ruins and have you and I finish him off.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
No, you're wearing your legs, right? <cf>As for your strength, [--]

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
I haven't had a chance to show it until now, but <cf>I can't wait to use a bow.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
While I was on the run with Carvein, <cf>I got a lot of training!
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
They say the best defense is a good offense, right? <cf>So I thought it might be a good idea to try it out myself.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Hmm... That's fine if the number of sweets is small. <cf>Then, where to lure them...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
Well... if the most recent sightings are near <cf>Minster Hills and the Andorra Basin...
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
How about “Ruins of the Giant Tower”?
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
If you walk around there conspicuously, they<cf>'ll catch you spiciously.
?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
It's a rough plan, but <cf>if we find a solution, there's no other way...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
That's fine. Let's Go Along with Your Plan. <cf>But don't be reckless, okay?

Got it! I'll show you my archery skills.

In your letter to Einrain, you also wanted him to take good care of you.

Yes, I received that letter from Einrain.

[PATH]316*\Scenario\eAV105_901.uasset[PATH]
Oh Myuri, do you have any easy, well-rounded requests?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
As always, FESTE-chan. <cf>That kind of request doesn't come around very often [--]
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
y
I want to say it doesn't exist, but <cf>it does exist...
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
What is this?! Tell us about it!! <cf>We'll take it before someone else does!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Calm down I just received a request, but <cf>I haven't posted it yet. The reason is...
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
The request and the reward are so out of sync that it feels a bit sad.
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
Oh? What's that about?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
“I want you to buy me a few days' worth of daily necessities.” <cf>The reward for that is this
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
... Huh? What kind of high reward is this!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Well, isn't this a joke? <cf>If it were true, even I would be skeptical!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
I thought so too, so I asked the client<cf>, but he said it wasn't
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
A souvenir deal in the name of everyday items...?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
That's a joke, so I'm unhappy.
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
... So, <cf>I'll ask Feste and the others to do this.
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
There is nothing wrong about the client or the content. <cf>It's just that the reward is not worth it.
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
Good job, Feste! <cf>This is convenient the “easy, well-off job” I was looking for!
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
Huh! So you were planning to push it onto us from the beginning,<cf>?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Until now, Jake has been the one to take on these symptoms of requests and others of them.
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
You Guys Can Be Assured Jake's Confidence, So <cf>I Can Leave It To You With Confidence!
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
Who is the prettiest couple? who is?!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
... Well, I Owe the Reclamation Bureau A Lot of Favor After All. <cf>Maybe I should give something back once in a while?
Npc_Feste
Player
thank you! <cf>If you want to talk to the client, go to the temple.
Npc_Murrie
Npc_All
Oh? Feste and the others... <cf>What's long?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
I came here today on business from the Bureau of Reclamation. <cf>I heard there was a client here.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Reclamation Bureau... Eh? <cf>Rejected the person who that accepted the request was...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Hmm? The job we wanted on was to buy some daily necessities...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Yes, that's me
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
<span size="Big">It's you!!! </>
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Wow, that makes sense now. <cf>You never know the going rate for requests.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Um... was that no good? <cf>Did I do something long?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Oh, well, don't worry about it. <cf>It's good to know that it's not a bad request.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
By the way, what are the daily necessities? <cf>Is there any shortcoming in taking care of the temple?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
No, the people at the temple are very kind to me.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
This time, it was all just my own self-contained, or rather, my pathetic nature was on full display...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Hmm? Let's tell you the whole story.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
... I was behind here because I was lying about Tiris, but [--]
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
I feel so sorry for sorry so much strain on you...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
So, when I was thinking about what I could do, I got to know an old lady who came to the temple.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
The musicians have been having trouble going out to buy groceries because her legs have become weak due to old age.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
I wanted to help out if it was just buying daily necessities, but...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Well, shopping at multiple places and frequent money convenience are very convenient for me, so...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
After much frustration, they made a request to the Reclamation Bureau.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Yes I NEVER THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD TAKE IT ON...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
No, I'm glad it was us. <cf>I'll have to thank Muley later.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Well, now that it has been happening that there is no crime committed, let's just get this over with.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Are you the daily necessities listed in this <cf>list that you received from the Reclamation Bureau?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Yes “Nenemarina Soap,” “Fluffy Flour,” and <cf>“Saffrea Seeds.”
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Okay. <cf>Let's buy “Nenemarina Soap” and “Fluffy Flour” from the Peddler.
Npc_Feste
Player
Are 'Saffreya Seeds'... <cf>It would be quicker to go and collect them.
Npc_Feste
Player
Then we go and buy some.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Then, I too [--]
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
This time, you are the client, so <cf>wait here. That's the way it is.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Uh... I'm tired. <cf>Thank you very much.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Welcome! What would you like today?
Npc_Peddler
Npc_All
I would like to have “Nenemarina Soap”
Npc_Feste
Npc_Peddler
Yes, there it is “Nenemarina Soap”! <cf>This is popular, isn't it? Here you go!
Npc_Peddler
Npc_All
Hmm, that's true!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Peddler
Hi. What can I do for you today?
Npc_Peddler
Npc_All
I would like to have “Fluffy Flour”
Npc_Feste
Npc_Peddler
“Fluffy Flour” has good stuff in it~
Npc_Peddler
Npc_All
Oh, this will be your favorite even your favorite.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Peddler
Saffreya the “Saffreya Seed”
Npc_information
Npc_information
This is the “Saffreia seed”. <cf>It was quicker to collect it after all.
Npc_Feste
Player
Hoh hoh ho. <cf>My shampoo is correct!
Npc_Feste
Player
Sorry to keep you waiting, client. <cf>I've got all the daily necessities for you!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
thank you! <cf>You Are Truly a Daredevil Adventurer.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Yes, it's talking as it says on the list. <cf>Then let's go to Grandma's house.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Grandma, Grandma. <cf>Is this the item you need?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Oldwoman
Oh, thank you! It really hurts me a lot. <cf>Shopping is hard at my age...
Npc_Oldwoman
Npc_Aerinse
I'd be happy to help you again if sorry. <cf>... or so I'd like to say.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Oldwoman
These people believe us with everything we need this time.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Oldwoman
Ah, no, we are...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Oldwoman
I'm not good enough... <cf>I'm so tired.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Oldwoman
Is that so? Thank you, ladies.
Npc_Oldwoman
Npc_Aerinse
Also, Mr. Erinze, there is nothing shameful about thoughts on others for things you can't do yourself.
Npc_Oldwoman
Npc_Aerinse
See, that's why I relied on you, Erinze-san. <cf>We all need to help each other in this world. right?
Npc_Oldwoman
Npc_Aerinse
... Yes
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Oldwoman
Please come and talk to me again when you go to the temple.
Npc_Oldwoman
Npc_Aerinse
... This presents the request. Thank you very much. <cf>I'm sorry for bothering you.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
what? I don't really mind this is much trouble. But [--]
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
First of all, you should have a good sense of money. <cf>Now I'll tell you, what kind of high salary is that!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Eh? I thought that was about the price...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
That's too busy! We are it, but if we accepted keeping things for things like that, the market would fall apart!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
First of all, to respond to requests from relaxation, you need a wealth of knowledge and the ability to apply it to any difficulties.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
You were not used to this era, and you were raised as a princess, so there will be something you can do on your own.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Uhh... you're right... <cf>I May Have Been A Little Impatient
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
As Feste says, I'm going to try to get used to the world. <cf>First of all, I need to improve my financial sense!
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
What should I do in that case? <cf>Maybe I should do a lot of shopping...?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
I can only see myself wasting money... <cf>That's true...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
To learn about the behavior and thinking of people living room in this era, <cf>why not try a job that seems familiar with customers?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Also, if you move your body, you'll feel less comfortable and think, “I'm the only one who's not doing anything.”
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
... That's right. You Won't Have Any Problems with Jake! <cf>If you're going to do it, I'm going to be out of the Coin Pavilion.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
That's a great idea! <cf>I'll ask Jake right away!
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
After a while [--]
Npc_information
Npc_information
Welcome!
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Erinze?! What's with that motivation?!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
These are my work clothes <cf>If you're going to work, you have to get changed, said Jake.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Servant. Call Muley. Tell Her That Jake is Happy to Dress An Innocent Woman in a Maid Wife
Npc_Feste
Player
STOP! It's a misunderstanding! <cf>That's something Elinze shampoo for relaxation!
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
I did include that in my list of complaints, but...
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Oh. What else do you have?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Hmm? This or that...?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Muuuuuuly! <cf>There's a pervert here!!!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
THE SKIRT IS JUST A LITTLE SHORT!
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Hehe, I like it shampoo

Npc_Villager_Youngman_02

That's right. By the Way, You Too, Big Brother. <cf>Are You Guys Adventurers, Right? Please let me make a request.

Are you in trouble? <cf>Let us help you in any way we can.

Npc_Carvain
npc_villager_mayors_son
carvain! Why do you make such a foolish promise!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
I'm sorry. My Pride as a Knight would not allow me to leave someone in trouble.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
Haa... What a soft guy. <cf>Oh well. There's no point in completeness here.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
Tell me what you want. <cf>In some cases, be prepared to pay extra.
?
Npc_Feste
npc_villager_mayors_son
Please spare us the extra charge... <cf>We're in real trouble.
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_All
A while ago, monsters started fighting, and <cf>they were leaving the village and it was a big problem.
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_All
They came in the morning, in the evening, and even in the morning. <cf>IT'S SO HARD TO EVEN THINK ABOUT WORK EXPENSIVE...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_All
That must be tough. You'll never have time to relax.
?
Npc_Carvain
npc_villager_mayors_son
master! I would like to help these people, <cf>is that okay?
?
Npc_Carvain
Player
Ah, I can't ignore people in trouble.

Npc_Carvain
Yes I can't ignore people in trouble.

Player
Npc_Carvain
thank you! You are truly a master!
?
Npc_Carvain
Player
huh... so? What should we do? <cf>Should we fight off the monsters that are attacking us?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_villager_mayors_son
No, if possible, I would like you to take action in advance. <cf>I can't stand to see my village being able to relax...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_All
I know where he lives. <cf>It's West of Here
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_All
Please save us. please! <cf>If this season, the village will die!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_All
Ah, leave it to me and my master! <cf>We will save the village!
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Oh dear. A Kindhearted Master and Enormous. <cf>Well, if it's a request that seems a fee, I guess that can't be said.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
The Monster's Lair is West of Here. <cf>Let's take a look right away.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
According to the information, this area attack to be the home of monsters that attack attack...

Npc_Feste
Npc_All
... Looks like he's not here right now

Npc_Carvain

Npc_Feste
Npc_All
[--] No Matter How Long I Wait, He Never Shows Up! <cf>Are you sure this is the right place?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Maybe we're in the long place. <cf>Let's go back to the village for now.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_All
Oh you guys! <cf>We've had a misunderstanding
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_All
A MONSTER JUST LIKE ME <cf>It would have been better if they had intercepted me here...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_All
what! And what about the damage to the village!?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_villager_mayors_son
That is [--]

Don't worry. There is no damage.

You, Barnhardt's...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Mr. Hugo!?
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
Well, I came across the scene of the attack. <cf>I'm not being able to just ignore it...
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
However, I can't finish him off. <cf>That guy is smart. He knows when to quit.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
You've Been Feeling by a Nasty Monster!
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Even the knight of the principality got away, what on earth should we do...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_Hugo
... Carvein, have you received an extermination request from this person?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Yes, I am. As a knight of the principality, I believe ignores someone in need.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
You're a knight, how humble of you to call yourself one. <cf>You're a “hero,” so you should be more arrogant.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
I am...
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
Now, people know Carvein. <cf>What do you think? Shall we join forces here?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Let's work together?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Yes You need people to hate that monster. <cf>And it's supposed to happen unless you're tired.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
But I only have three knights to escort me on my inspection tour.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
So, I would like to ask for your help, including Carvein.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Hmm...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Oh! Of course, if you are successful, <cf>I will give you all the rewards.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Even so, I am still a public figure. <cf>I can't line my favorite at the places I visit.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
So, it's talking about caring people. <cf>What do you think?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
... We Haven't Even Seen the Monster yet. <cf>But the Knights have loved it and felt it.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
In that case, as this guy says, <cf>it would be more efficient to join forces.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
The negotiation is complete. Now, we are friends.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Could you please take me to the monster's den? I want to confirm something.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
I'll leave the village's defense to the knights, so <cf>I'd like you to protect me.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Are you a guard for Lord Yugo? <cf>I have to be tired not to look at the women on the way.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Carvain
No way, Carvain! <cf>I'm always focused on work, you know? Hahaha!
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
We've got excited. This is where the monsters live. <cf>... it seems they haven't been able to hate yet.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
That's right. <cf>Let me look into it a bit.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
... hey, maybe, <cf>he's heading to the village again?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
I guess so. <cf>I made it so before I left the village.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
I see... what? <cf>I made it dressed...!?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Yes But it's okay. <cf>Why do you think we left the knights in the village?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
Look, while they attract monsters, we'll search for their habitats.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
So you were planning to use your comrades as a decoy from the beginning!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Please don't get angry. <cf>There was something that was bothering me.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
... That monster is not attacking the village for food. <cf>There must be another reason for attacking the village attack.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
Well, I guess you can guess. <cf>I just need one more dot to connect the dots.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
Oh, the Knights of the Principality are beautiful. <cf>Don't worry, they won't die worried.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
Hey you!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Sorry. Hold it for now.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
All knights are used to this kind of thing. <cf>It's their job to put their bodies on the line.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
Delight, let's explore this area as Yugo-sama said.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
Lord Yugo is a bit of a quirky guy, but he's not worthy as a high-ranking civil servant for nothing.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
I'm sure you'll find a way to resolve it.
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
... If you, a member of the Knights, say so, I have no choice. <cf>I'm not excited, but I'll look into this area.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
...! Check this out!
?
Player
Npc_Hugo
...! Look at this!
?
Player
Npc_Hugo
... Human footprints and ruins. <cf>Is that so?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
This is the reason why monsters started attacking attacks.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
What do you mean? <cf>I don't really worry...
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
Someone in the Village Depressed a Baby Monster. <cf>THE BABY MONSTER SEEDS SELL FOR A HIGHER PRICE AS MATERIAL.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Material... <cf>The crime of a greedy person...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
That's enough. Let's go back to the village. <cf>We need to check on the children.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Yugo-sama! I'm glad you're safe!
?
Npc_Principality_Knight
Npc_Hugo
As I thought, you were being stuck by monsters. <cf>Are you having a hard time?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Principality_Knight
I'm ashamed to say. As Yugo-sama Instructed, <cf>I learned in explanation you, but [--]
?
Npc_Principality_Knight
Npc_Hugo
Feeling them is a pain. <cf>We just don't have enough manpower.

Npc_Hugo
Don't worry, don't worry. <cf>The Carvains will help you.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Principality_Knight
[--] So, I look forward to working with you. <cf>Oh, please capture the monsters instead of killing them.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
After you've said whatever you want. <cf>I have no choice. Let's go, servant Carvein!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Okay, looks like you managed to catch it.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Let's go back to the village and report it.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
I can't believe you caught that monster... <cf>thank you! thank you!
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_All
Now I can finally sleep peacefully...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_All
Oops, the problem isn't solved yet. <cf>I have to ask you something.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
... I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS VILLAGE WHO SUFFERED THAT MONSTER'S CHILD FOR MONEY.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
...!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
For now, we don't care whether the child is alive or dead, so <cf>would you please come forward?
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
[--] If You Stay Quiet, <cf>I Will Release The Monsters Right Here and Now.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
No, stop! <cf>It was me! I did it!!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_Hugo
you...!?
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
S-sorry. <cf>When I found the nest, I just...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
npc_villager_mayors_son
... what happened to the children?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
I'm still alive. I can sell it for a higher price...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_All
Hey, don't mess with me! <cf>You love us all a lot of trouble!
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
I-I'm so sorry! <cf>I was so scared I couldn't bring myself to say it...!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
npc_villager_mayors_son
You bastard!!
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Yes, that's enough. <cf>Don't make things shampoo.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
But because of this guy, everyone!
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Hugo
Decent, no one has trouble, right? <cf>If so, there is still room for discussion.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
First of all, what is the solving problem?
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
what? <cf>That's because this guy turned up a monster's child...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Hugo
Why did you have to do that?
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
... Grandma is not feeling well. <cf>I Want Her to Get Treatment in the Principality or Asterlies...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_Hugo
So, I wanted the money as soon as possible. <cf>There's a limit to how much money I can borrow from the villagers...
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
Npc_Hugo
...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
There's the answer. <cf>In other words, motivation was the cause.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
If he had no money problems, he would not have committed such an outrageous act as stealing a monster's child.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
Yes... but...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Hugo
I'm sorry, but this village as a whole is not sorry.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
So why don't we think about how we can make wealth accessible to everyone?
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
That's so useful for us...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Hugo
I'll be happy to give you advice if you'd like. <cf>Even so, I have some influence in the Principality, so
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
... <cf>First of all, please meet my father... the village chief.
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Hugo
You bring me the monster's child. <cf>And, if it's money, I'll do something about it...
?
npc_villager_mayors_son
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
...! I'm sorry. thank you...!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_02
npc_villager_mayors_son
That's okay too. I told you I had some influence in the Principality.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
It's no problem to solve for a doctor. <cf>Don't worry.
?
Npc_Hugo
npc_villager_mayors_son
...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Well, thank you for your help this time.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Don't worry, we'll take care of the rest. <cf>Oh, I'll give you a reward too.
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
Well then, I'll go and visit the village chief's house. <cf>Good day, everyone!
?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
... As You Said, <cf>It Feels You Are Not Expecting As A High-Ranking Civil Servant For Nothing.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
Huh?
?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
He used this turmoil to win the hearts of the villagers.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
I believe they said it was an inspection for a relocation plan. <cf>... This will leave you with one of the candidate locations.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Ugh... What a wink. <cf>Do you know that we'll notice your feelings?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
He never misses an opportunity he finds... <cf>He's really a bottomless guy.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
[PATH]637*\Scenario\eAV105_903.uasset[PATH]
You two have come at just the right time. <cf>I have a small favor to ask of you, if that's OK?
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Hmm? It depends on the content, but let me tell you
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
?
Thank you very much. It is because you are close to Einrain that I would like to ask you to help me.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Recently, someone is calling the “Oracle Priestess” has attracted and is calling the people of the city.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I'm not that... Einrain who escaped from the temple?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Hmm... I don't deny that Einrain has a wandering habit.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
But Mr. Einrain is doing his job well here.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
So, we can say with motivation that the Oracle Maiden who appeared in [the city] is a fake.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
The Oracle Priestess does not pray in public except for rituals and pilgrimages. Deceive, it's easy to deceive her.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I see... So, judging from the flow of your story, <cf>you want us to catch that impostor?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Yes As you know, due to the incident with the Duchy of Barnhardt, the Order is short on death.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
But even if I were to hire an adventurer, the content would be too much... <cf>What do you think? Would you be willing to take it on?
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Okay. Leave it to me.
?
Player
Npc_Ryugerio
Okay. Leave it to me.
?
Player
Npc_Ryugerio
I'm also tired in the fake Einrain. <cf>As the servant says, I'll give you a hand here.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
As expected, they are people attracted by the God of Bafaria. <cf>It's very tasty.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
It's a fake, but one of the priests presents it just the other day. <cf>It would be best to hear it happen from him.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Hey Priest! Is it you who saw the fake Shrine Maiden?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_priest_3rdClass
Yes Lord Lugerio has asked me to tell you the details.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
I saw the fake shrine maiden in Bergmar
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
I Go There Pray to Pray for the Pray Who Was Supposed When Their Village Was Pray
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
Maybe because they were cleaning up, when I went there, there were some former cleaning of the village.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
The person at the center of it all was the fake [in question].
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
I have never seen the Holy Face of the Oracle Priestess<cf>, so...
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
From what the villagers said, I mistakenly thought that a shrine maiden had trouble.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
So, I thought I'd take this opportunity to say hello, but <cf>he ran away.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
There was something about his strangely hasty attitude that bothered me, so <cf>I hurried back to the temple and the matter of Belkmal, and [--]
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
So it was a fake?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_priest_3rdClass
Yes <cf>At that time, the priestess of the Oracle was praying in the sanctuary.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
Hmm... What was the reaction of the people in Bergmar at that time?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_priest_3rdClass
Everyone was praising the fake. <cf>It felt that he was tired very well.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
In prayer, they also pray free of charge and relaxation clean up the village.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
Aren't you afraid to [Tarnish] your reputation...?
?
Npc_Feste
npc_priest_3rdClass
... I'm ashamed to say that if I didn't run away, I might have to worry it to be real too.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
She feels like a simple girl of about 15 or 16 years old. <cf>She was graceful, kind, and had pure eyes.
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
I can't imagine that girl is plotting anything...
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
Even so, there is no reason that she lied about her status as the Oracle's Priestess.
?
Npc_Feste
npc_priest_3rdClass
Yes, yes... That's right...
?
npc_priest_3rdClass
Npc_All
Let's hear from the villagers. <cf>I want to know what impression they had of the fakes.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
With that feeling, let's head to Berkmal right away!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Hmm? What is it, you guys? <cf>What business do you have in these ruins?
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
Sorry to interrupt you in the middle of cleaning up. I heard that there is <cf>an Oracle Maiden around here.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Ah, that's a pity. <cf>The Oracle Priestess was here until recently.
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
He was a really wonderful person. <cf>He was kind and jealous...
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
When I think that a person like that is leading a cult, <cf>My Faith Only Cult!
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
I see. I'd love to meet you! <cf>By the way [--]
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Did the Oracle Priestess come alone? <cf>Did she have a girlfriend to lose her?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
No, I was alone from the beginning. <cf>I just wanted to come across these ruins...
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
[“] Is there anything I can help you with? [”] and <cf>he was very proactive in caring me.
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
At First I Thought She Was Some Village Girl, but the Way She Said Assured for the Thought Was Divine...
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
A village girl from sleeping...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
Um, did the Oracle Priestess identify?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Come to think of it, I've never been able to come forward...
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
When someone called out to her as the Oracle's Shrine Maiden, she laughed in a troubled manner. She must have been visiting incognito.
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
I see. Thank you <cf>Good luck with the cleaning!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Yeah. <cf>I hope you guys can meet the shrine maiden too!
?
Npc_Villager_Man_Before
Npc_All
I just want to ask you something. Have you ever met an Oracle Priestess?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Yes, there is. Just the other day! <cf>Look. I had this evening ceremony by a shrine maiden.
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
When I was cleaning up, I cleaned cut my palm. <cf>The Shrine Maiden Healing and Immediately Healed Me.
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
Really... that guy is amazing
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
I wanted to say something to thank you, but <cf>[“] your smiles are the best thank you [”]
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
You Are Truly Someone Who Can Hear the Voice of God. <cf>You Are Different From Us Every Day!
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
... Feeling me, but <cf>was that person really the Oracle Priestess?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
What are you talking about! If that person isn't the Oracle's Priestess, then who is the Priestess?
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
Well, maybe he was incognito, <cf>but he never felt like...
?
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
Npc_Feste
I see. <cf>Thank you for talking to me!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Woman_Before
So You Haven't Had Named Yourself Yet? <cf>Hmm...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
Feeling me, do you know where the Oracle Priestess has gone?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Youngman_Before
The Oracle Priestess went to Ralpal. <cf>I wanted to escort her there because it was dangerous for her to go alone.
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_Before
Npc_Feste
[“] It's OK because God has worried me [”] and I was totally down.
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman_Before
Npc_Feste
I see. Thank you very much.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Villager_Youngman_Before
Hmm... I don't feel refreshed. <cf>I'll need some time to think about it.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Let's talk the information first
?
Npc_Feste
Player
The fake is a simple girl of 15 or 16 years old, but she is so charmed by the charming class priest who chose it.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
He is loved by the villagers he meets in person, and is very kind and tasty.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Also, she does not call herself the Maiden of Oracles, and she does not deny it either.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
... When I first heard about this, I thought that he was using the name of Einrain to Extort money from me.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
There doesn't seem to be any sign of that at the moment. <cf>OR WILL HE REVEAL HIS TRUE COLORS AFTER TOUCH PEOPLE'S HEARTS?
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Let's go to Lalpal. It can't have been that long since the girl left here.
?
Player
Npc_Feste
Let's go to Lalpal. It hasn't been that long since the girl left here.
?
Player
Npc_Feste
That's right. Even if you've got left Ralpal, you can still pick up some information.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
O Oracle Maiden! Please accept this.
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman
Npc_Girl
Thank you <cf>But your kind of shampoo is relaxation.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Villager_Youngman
I can't have that. <cf>Please share it with others.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Villager_Youngman
Shrine maiden... how merciful!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman
Npc_Girl
...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Villager_Youngman
Interrupting me for interrupting! <cf>Are you the Oracle Priestess?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
We are related to the relaxation organization. <cf>We Came to Welcome to the Oracle's Shrine Maiden.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
[--]! Ah, well, I...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Oh, I'm in the way. Well then. <cf>Thank you, Shrine Maiden!
?
Npc_Villager_Youngman
Npc_Girl
...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Well, let's get to the main topic. <cf>To put it bluntly, aren't you a fake Oracle Priestess?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
I have been asked by the cult to search for you. <cf>Please come with me to the Temple of Asterlies.
?
Player
Npc_Girl
I have been asked by the cult to search for you. <cf>Please come with me to the Temple of Asterlies.
?
Player
Npc_Girl
... Yes. I'm tired.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Hmm? You're being naive. <cf>Are you going to resist or run away?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
If The Cult Knows Of My Desire, It Would Be Supposed To Run Away. Drowsy...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Relaxation, I'm a little relieved. Now I don't have to pretend to be the <cf>Oracle Maiden.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
... Before I go to the temple, can you tell me the temple?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
... I am an ordinary girl with no redeeming features. <cf>My Family often told me that
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
[『] It makes no difference whether you're here or not. <cf>You're like air to me. [”]
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
One day, when I stopped by the village, a shrine maiden who could deliver oracles called out to me.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
I could only hear your voice through the door... <cf>[“] You're not air. You're talking to me. [”]
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
[“] Thanks to you, I am able to enjoy my time even during my pilgrimage. ["]
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
[“] The Time I Spend with You Must Be a Gift from the God of Baphalia [”]...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Listening to him like this, Einrein is quite the people-pleaser...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
To me, the words of the shrine maiden were a divine revelation. <cf>Even someone like me can be of use to someone.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
So I chose the right and left home. I Wanted to Join a Necessary Order and Live a Life of Service to the Gods, Just Like the Shrine Maidens.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
... When I lost someone along the way, <cf>something went long.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
I was happy when he thanked me. When he asked me my name, I said, “I'm a shrine maiden of the cult.”
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Well, for me, [“] I am (planning to become) a shrine maiden of the cult [”]<cf>, but I got lost away...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
After that, people there started coming to me one after another to ask for advice about their problems.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
It's nice to be relied on, so <cf>I solved my best to solve the problem solved [--]
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Soon, someone is calling me the <cf>Oracle Maiden...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Shouldn't you have denied it then and there?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
When I saw everyone's expectant eyes, I felt tired that it wasn't the same, so I just dragged on...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
I thought it was long. <cf>I didnt expect someone like me to be mistaken for a shrine maiden of oracles.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
But I didn't want to be upset everyone. <cf>I was dying of disappearing them!
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
So now that you've come to catch me, I feel a greater sense of relief.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
At last... I can be tired...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
I believe that you have no ill will. <cf>You should tell me everything I have just said at the temple.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
I don't think it will be that bad...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
No, I will accept any complaints. Of all things, I have lied in the name of the relaxation Oracle Priestess.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Hmm... Shame, I'll take this girl to <cf>Lygherio.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
...
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Ryugerio
[--] Well, the reason this girl lied about being the Oracle's maiden was because of a misunderstanding from those around her.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
The Girl Had No Ultrusive Motives, <cf>and Was Only Supposed by Helping Someone.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
By Denying The Missing That She Was A Shrine Maiden, <cf>She Was Disappearing Of Disappearing The People Around Her.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
... I see. I chose the shampoo.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
What a pure-hearted person. <cf>This is something that seems to be simply relaxing.
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Npc_Girl
What do you think, Mr. Lugelio? <cf>THIS GIRL'S SHOULD BE SHOULD BE TOGETHER [--]
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Npc_Ryugerio
As a Priest, You Shouldn't Be Waited Swayed by Your Priest.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
npc_priest_1stClass
Whatever the circumstances, the crime of making someone believe she was an Oracle is grave. <cf>It is the same as [plotting] the god of Baphalia.
?
Npc_Ryugerio
npc_priest_1stClass
But in the end, this girl got someone and earned the respect of the Oracle Priestess, right?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
It's ok. I'm ready
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
I had no ill luck. But a crime is a crime. <cf>I must be prepared for having deceived God.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_All
Why don't you try and put in some effort?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Girl
Serves, I pray to serve God with my body and my heart.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Ryugerio
Lord Lugerio...
?
npc_priest_1stClass
Npc_Ryugerio
... Are You Prepared to Serve God and <cf>Prepared Yourself for Him?
?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Girl
Yes It was the words of the Oracle that felt a pleasure to my lips, something like air.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Ryugerio
I would be happy if you could pray the God of Baphalia pray that shrine maiden prayer.
?
Npc_Girl
Npc_Ryugerio
... I'm tired. <cf>Then, as the high priest, I will pronounce the ceremony.
?
Npc_Ryugerio

J
I just wanted to come and have a look... <cf>What's this? He looks pretty cool.
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Oh! Thank you very much for your help at that time. <cf>You Were Related to the Cult, Weren't You?
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
I SAW YOU HAVING A FRIENDLY CONVERSATION WITH LORD LUGERIO AT THE STAR SPIRIT FESTIVAL.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
It's not the most important way to put it, but it's going to be fair to say they are related to the group.
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
So You, Too, Came to the Star Spirit Festival?
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Yes Even though I am kept at a distance, <cf>I am still a priest. And [--]
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
I was also born about Milrene who had to become a diva.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
... How is Milrene doing after that?
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
I thought that you would come back here after the Star Spirit Festival was over, but there has been no sign of that feeling.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
Don't worry. I'm doing my job well! <cf>Well, in exchange for the books and documents in the temple,
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Hahaha, that thought to be it
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
... I saw her singing at the Star Spirit Festival, <cf>and it was very exciting.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
I guess she'll end up thinking a career in singing after all.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
Wait a minute. I don't think that's the case. <cf>I can't go back because I still have work to do.
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
The Title of Diva is an honorable position. THE STATUS, TREATMENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF AN ORDINAL HISTORY WITHOUT ANY LIGHTS.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
She'd be a relaxing living room as a diva. <cf>Yes, that's right. I bet that's right. Yes, that's right.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
No, no, first I need to confirm with him what he wants to do [--]
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
<cf>I beg your pardon, but could you please give this paper to Mirlene?
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
I completed the collaborative research with her. <cf>I Told My Passengers to Think of It as a “Farewell Gift” from My Master to Him as He Embarks on a New Path.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
Oops, this guy just wanted it all in his own mind without listening to what other people said.
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Whenever we met, we would just talk, but from now on, that will not be possible.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
Feeling the Nest is both happy and sad... <cf>hehe...
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
Ahh... This is no good. <cf>I'm excited in my own world.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
I have no choice. I'll go and deliver this paper to Milrene. <cf>The rest will have to be between teacher and student.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
What's long? <cf>I haven't made the offering yet.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
This is a gift from Walkin to you. <cf>He said, “Think of this paper as a parting gift from your teacher.”
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
[Parting gift]...?
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
He thought you would quit being a teenager and lose a career as a singer.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Huh? Huh? What's that? That's a horrible misunderstanding!
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
I never said anything about quitting my job as a teenager! <cf>I ONLY THE ROLE OF DIVA ACCEPTED IN EXCHANGE FOR THE TEMPLE'S DOCUMENTS!
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
We said the same thing, but <cf>it felt like a straight line if you make up your mind.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Ahh... Typical of a professor... <cf>That stubbornness is also useful in your research.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
I'm sorry, but please feel this is between you and your student. <cf>So, we're done now.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Now that this has motivation, let's talk about this paper from top to bottom and let them feel my completeness. That's the only way!
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
So, I'd like to ask you guys to <cf>do some relaxation research right away, is that okay?
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
Wow, as expected from Master and Exception. <cf>He got me so tired.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Because of my feelings as a songstress, I can't leave the temple for long stories of time.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
So please. <cf>I'll sing for the musicians. right?
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
... It can't be difficult. I've been tired with it.
P
Player
Npc_Milene
... It can't be difficult. I've been tired with it.
P
Player
Npc_Milene
thank you! Well, at first glance, <cf>I guess there isn't enough information here.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
I had been talking to my teacher about it for a while, but <cf>I had half given up because it was too dangerous.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
A Boss Monster Took It Into The Den, and <cf>I Couldn't Find It For Many Years and It Was A Problem.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
So, please go to the place called “Mountain Path of Sopra” and collect some relics!
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
You've given me a very thorough task, but since you said you'd do it, do your best, servant.
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Because I believe in your skills. <cf>Nice to meet you!
P
Npc_Milene

I think I slept 3 hours in 3 days...

That's not something to be stoked on!
P
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
It's okay. I did my job trick. <cf>Above all, I wanted to clear up the teacher's misunderstanding as soon as possible.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
So, yes. Please take this humiliating paper, full of red corrections, to your teacher.
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
... If you read this, I think you'll feel my true feelings
P
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
It's a strange relationship between master and couple... <cf>I'm tired. I'll be happy deliver it, so go to bed.

Yes... <cf>Well then, I look forward to meeting you...

sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Is there a problem with the complicated material? There is an older paper than this... <cf>Ah, in the closed stacks of the temple. I can't get my hands on this.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Hmm? I think Milrene's motivation is too forceful. <cf>There is some truth in what you're worried, but it's just inference!
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin

It appeared I was a mistaken. <cf>She had no desire of quitting her research career.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
I'm ashamed of myself for motivation this. <cf>No, I'm just rejecting it.
P
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
It's true. When both Master and Confidently <cf>believe, they go straight for it.
P
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Expecting she now has her motivation as a diva, <cf>she uses them to become her research.
P

That's true. However, The Master Thoughts is lazy while his doubles work hard.

First of all, why are you alone?
m
Npc_Feste

m
Npc_girl_common

Is this reckless born out of good luck...?
m
Npc_Feste

m
Npc_girl_common

To become attractive, it is important to look at yourself in this way.

Face your feelings without turning away from them. <cf>It may be simple, but it's a very delicate task.

Npc_girl_common
It's more than enough! <cf>With this, the man's going to be going to be excited!
m

Npc_Merlouf
Okay, then I hope you deliver it soon. <cf>Are you okay on your own from here?
m
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_girl_common
Yes, it's close by. While I was gathering herbs, I also checked to see if there were any monsters.
m

Npc_Merlouf
I see. Well then, be careful. <cf>See you again soon.

m
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
That's right. As a thank you for your help, I'd like to tell you.
m
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
I was looking for that girl [--], or rather, a girl with the potential to become as strong as that girl, I guess.
m
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
That child will become very strong in the future, both pregnant and angry.
m
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
I want to help someone, and I'm willing to help myself for that. That's the first step to becoming a hero.

To help and guide these children, <cf>I travel all over the place like this.

Npc_Merlouf

Npc_Jake
Player
You're the new guy. <cf>I'm Muly, the General Information Clerk. Nice to meet you.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Well, first of all, I'd like to explain about this reclamation bureau.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Various requests come in here from all over the country. <cf>IT'S ANYTHING FROM MONSTER EXTERMINATION TO LOST ITEMS, RIGHT?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
If you accept a request and complete it, you will be given a reward. <cf>The More Thoughts the Request, The Better the Reward.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
That's all for the basic shampoo. <cf>Let's start the registration test right away.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
There's no need to be so strict. <cf>I'll prepare a request that matches your ability.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Oh? Isn't that the Imaginee Seed you have?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
We found it in the “Cliff Ruins”... <cf>We don't know much about it.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Can I have a look?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
This is...
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Goblin Battle Imaginee
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Tch, a goblin...
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Oh...? <cf>You can use this right away.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
You're lucky to have found it in this condition. <cf>Please make use of it.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Let's start the registration test. <cf>When you're ready, talk to me
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
If you become an adventurer, I'm sure I'll be able to be able to overcome you to some good-natured jobs soon.
?
Npc_Jake
Player
Oh, that's a good deal! <cf>You have a point, right?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Of course! For that reason, I need to pass the exam exam exam.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
I'm looking forward to going on an adventure with you too. <cf>Good Luck! Do your best!
?
Npc_Jake
Player
Are you going to take the Adventurer registration exam?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Okay. <cf>Oh, so the recommender was Jake...
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
You've got a track record of defeating goblins... <cf>So, I guess it's enough to just confirm your motivation.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Now, let me explain the exam.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
You will now be tasked with some tasks.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
The first task is to overcome<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>Please give me a total of 5 snacks.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
What,<value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>? <cf>It's a piece of cake for you.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
I know you're not a good enough to fight again, but I'm sorry. This is also a rule.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Think about fighting in various ways. <cf>For example, try using Battle Imagine.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
You want to have it, right? <cf>Using Imaginee will expand the range of ways you can fight.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Well then, let's start by defeating. <value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/> <cf>Good luck!
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Welcome back. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E006_00_00_01001"/>Is the Hunt Over?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
[--] Yes, I confirmed it. <cf>You Have Now Passed The First Assignment.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
It looks like there were no problems. <cf>I guess Jake recommended it after all.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Yeah, yeah, yeah. <cf>Well, I was the one who first became this guy!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Haha, you're right. <cf>It's rude to say it's Jake's fault.
?
Npc_Murrie
Npc_Feste
Okay, let's move on to the second task. <cf>Next time, I'll have you try something more adventure-like.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
There is a place called “Lakerid Mine” in the “Sea Roaring Plains” of the Asteria Plains.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
'Lakerid Mine'. <cf>I'm sure it's an old mine, isn't it? I hear the name from time to time.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Throw, it's the pleasure of a former mine tunnel. <cf>Explore it and reach the end.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
After it was closed down, Monsters started living room there. <cf>IT'S NOT THAT DANGEROUS ATTENTION.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
The Reclamation Bureau is recruiting over it, so I thought it would be a good idea to use it to test the skills of new recruits.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Wow. You're thinking of something unconscious wild.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Fufu. As an Adventurer, I need you to be able to be able to take pleasure like this on your own.
?
Npc_Murrie
Npc_Feste
So, the Exploration of the Lakerid Mine is the second task.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Dungeons are not like fieldwork, so <cf>keep your head up. Good luck!
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
There's a place over there where engrams are spewing out of the ground. That's the landmark.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
It's called “Star Vein Hole”. It's connected to Ruins and Caves. <cf>If you find it, remember the location.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
It feels like that the Lakerid Mine is connected to the Starvein Hole here.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Well then, shall we go in? Muli said it wasn't that dangerous, but...
?
Npc_Feste
Player
This is a place to see the skills of newcomers. <cf>You have to expect a few problems.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Are you ready? <cf>You're fine, but don't let your guard down!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Well, it's around here... <cf>There May be some formidable ceremony [--]
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV101_030_060_035_ADD600
Do not be afraid. <cf>Let's make a name for relaxation together!
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV101_030_060_035_ADD602
That's... an Ogre!? <cf>I NEVER HEARD OF AN OGRE MUST!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
MAV101_030_062_035_ADD604
... I was tired. <cf>That was an ogre...
?
Npc_Feste
Player
I didn't know something like that would come out! <cf>I thought it would be at most a Mook...
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Even if it's part of the exam, <cf>it's too hard for a trial.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Well, you have married him. <cf>Well done, my servant! I shall lose you!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
This should be the end of the test. <cf>Now, let's proudly report it to Muiri!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Welcome back. I've been waiting for you.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
From the looks of it... hehe, it seemed to have gone well. <cf>How was the Lakerid Mine?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
That's what I'm talking about. <cf>Isn't this assignment a bit too complicated?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
I didn't hear that even Ogres would have loved! <cf>They're too tough for a teenager.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Ogre? What are you talking about? <cf>I haven't received any such report.
?
Npc_Murrie
Npc_Feste
What, wasn't this part of the test?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
Of course. There's No Way A Dangerous Monster Like An Ogre Would Be Included In The Exam.
?
Npc_Murrie
Npc_Feste
... Huh? Wait a minute. <cf>Did you say an Ogre?
?
Npc_Murrie
Npc_Feste
Oh, that was really exciting. <cf>Hey, servant.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
what?! really?! <cf>Even Adventurers have trouble with these monsters!?
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Does Ogre have an Ogre in the Lakerid Mine? <cf>I'll contact the higher-ups right away, so just wait!
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Phew... Sorry to have kept you waiting. <cf>For Now, I've Sent Out An Incurable Team To The Lakerid Mine.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Even so... you're amazing. <cf>You can beat an ogre right off the bat.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Everyone was pregnant. <cf>Maybe some great people will join us!
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
heh! right? right? <cf>Well, I was the one who got it first!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
He's got the Ogre, and did he hate his talent, will you beat him from the rest?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
No. That's that, and this is this. <cf>Please complete the exhaustive tasks thank you.
?
Npc_Murrie
Npc_Feste
But you told me some important information. <cf>I'm sorry I don't have anything.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
I will throw the matter with the higher-ups. <cf>I'll thank you later
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Well then, let's continue with the exam. <cf>The Next Assignment is “Learn about crafts.”
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Craft...? <cf>Make a weapon, you say?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Murrie
IT'S NOT JUST JUST LIKE. You Can Also Craft and Survive Imagines Used by Adventurers.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Mastering the use of relaxation and imaginees that are the best relaxation to you. <cf>This is also one of the skills required for an adventurer.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
To do that, you need to know how to craft. <cf>You'll need to do this a lot in the future.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
Well, let's start by crafting a weapon. <cf>Talk to Huovi at Craftsman Square.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
What can I say... she's unique, so <cf>I think you'll notice right away.
?
Npc_Murrie
Player
This is Huovi from the Craftsmen's Square. <cf>Okay, let's go and check it out!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Hey, if you're talking to me, does that mean you're really struggling in weapon crafting?
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Feeling, a very light-hearted guy asking. <cf>Are you Huovi?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Huovi
This guy is in the middle of the adventurer registration exam. <cf>He told me to ask you about weapon crafting.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Huovi
Oh! Could it be that Jake becomes a superstar rising star? Oh man, I'm so excited!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Crafted, let's talk about crafting. <cf>I'm Huovi from the Imaginee Lab. Nice to meet you!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
There are three steps to crafting a weapon
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
1. Find the weapon recipe <cf>2. Collect the materials written in the recipe
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
3. Craft with the “Tenkyuu Renseigi” <cf>Now You Can Make a New Weapon, So Hold On to It!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
First, the recipe. <cf>Where can I get it?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Huovi
YOU'VE BEEN TO THE LAKERID MINE, RIGHT? <cf>If you want it, you should have to relax up the recipe.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
You Can Check All the Recipes You Have Now and the Materials You Need at the “Turning Ball Training Routine” there.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
The Material You Will Need for the Assignment is “Crystal Rough.” <cf>You can find it in “The Sea Roaring Plains”, so please look forward to it!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
I've been to “The Sea Roaring Grassland” many times, so I'm sure <cf>I've eaten a few things.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Oh, sorry? Then you're lucky ☆
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
The Weapon I Want You to Make is from the “Adventures” series. <cf>The type can be anything that matches your class ♪
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Just Show Me the Weapon You're Done and You're Done! <cf>I'll be waiting here, so do your best~
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Okay, let's get started. First, let's check the recipe and recipes.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
The task is to craft forget, so be careful not to forget.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Good job! <cf>Oh! You've made a great weapon!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
How is it? I have no worries. <cf>Just give me the shampoo letter shampoo.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Huovi
Oh, oh, don't panic. <cf>There's something else I want you to know!
?
Npc_Huovi
Npc_Feste
Sweetheart don't all have the same shampoo.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
It has special effects against goblins, and there are many <cf>sockets for attaching attacks, so it's changed in many ways.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
The fun part of crafting! <cf>It's not a surprising thing, but a lot of times you try it.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Once You Find a Weapon Recipe, <cf>Craft Your New Weapon Right Away!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Hmm. That makes me sad. <cf>... so? Did I pass or file?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Huovi
Of Course You Passed! Here you go, your motivation notice. !
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Next is the Last Assignment, right? <cf>The Last One is “Enhanced Imaginee Craft”
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Enhance Imaginee?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Huovi
Is The Exam to Craft Trips and Imaginee, right? That's it, that's it.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
There's someone called Poirier at the Imaginee Laboratory, so maybe you should ask him?
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
The Ima Lab is just to the left after leaving the Reclamation Bureau.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Hmm. All right, my servant. Let's go. <cf>We're going to visit Poirier at the “Imaginee Laboratory.”
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Welcome to the Imaginee Laboratory. <cf>Are you the Rookie who was rumored to have loved Ogre?
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Nice to meet you, I'm Poirier. Nice to meet you. <cf>I heard about the registration test from Muli.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
That would be a quick story. <cf>Tell me about “Enhanced Imaginee's Craft”
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Poirier
Okay. First, let me explain enhance Imaginee relaxation.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Enhanced Imagine is an “Imagine Imagine”. <cf>It wears the clothes of the person who wears it.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
It's an Imaginee that not only boosts attack power, but also defense power, mental strength, and critical hit power.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
I see, it's more important than I thought. <cf>I can see why it's recommended in relaxation.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Poirier
So you craft it, right? <cf>Us... no, what should we do with this thing?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Poirier
Crafting Enhanced Imagines is the same as for musicians. <cf>First you need a recipe.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
The Recipe for the Test is “E-Cucumber Cucumber.” <cf>I'll give it to you now, okay?
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Enhanced Imaginee is improving using a seed as the core and a catalyst material.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
This Time It's “Dynamic Engram Fragment” and “Tokoyo Grass”. <cf>You should be able to find them if you search for “Sea Roaring Plains”
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
The process is the same as crafting crafts. <cf>Where do you craft them?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Poirier
Imaginee crafts are accepted at the laboratory. <cf>Speak to the staff at the counter below.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Finally, show me the completed Enhance Imaginee and the test assignment will be completed.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Okay, let's get started. <cf>This is the last assignment. Stay strong!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Good job. <cf>Have you finished crafting enhance Imaginee?
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Yeah, that's good. <cf>This will pass without questions.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
. <cf>Yes, I passed the final assignment.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
All the right! Well done. <cf>You're truly the servant I trusted!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
There are many different types of Enhance Imaginee. <cf>Find recipes during your adventure and make full use of them.
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Then, Battle Imagine also at the laboratory...
?
Npc_Poirier
Player
Hey, how are you? How are you doing it?
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Huovi? Hey, what are you doing here?
?
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Huovi
I was pregnant that my sister was doing her job motivation. <cf>I was sick that she was making a serious and dangerous trouble.
?
Npc_Huovi
Npc_Poirier
I don't want you to tell me that! <cf>Nah, come on. Don't worry me.
?
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Huovi
Oh! You have your shampoo letter! <cf>You're now going to be an adventurer! !
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Go show it to Mew-chin shampoo. <cf>I Don't Need You Mess, Big Sister!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Hey, wait a minute! <cf>I'm not done sorry yet!
?
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Huovi
Oh, and have you heard of Battle Imagine?
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Battle Imagines are also in the laboratory. <cf>The Method is the Same as Enhance Imagines.
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
Find a recipe, gather the dishes, and <cf>order at the counter!
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
If it's a weapon, it's the ball-out training exercise. If it's an Imaginee, it's the research lab. <cf>Remember this, Yoroshiku ☆
?
Npc_Huovi
Player
<span size="Big">Don't take other people's jobs!! </>
?
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Huovi
Why did you sleep My Words, You Sleazy Little Brother? <cf>I had written down everything I was going to say right to the end!
?
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Huovi
It's because my sister is doing it so tired. <cf>That's why you're an apprentice forever.
?
Npc_Huovi
Npc_Poirier
You!! Just because you're a regular employee, you have no right to say things like that!!
?
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Huovi
So these two are tired... <cf>This doesn't happen like a good match.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
It doesn't look like it's going to calm down for a while... <cf>We'll go to the Reclamation Bureau and report to Muiri.
?
Npc_Feste
Player

She will teach you how to rank up. <cf>In some cases, there will be a battle there too.

Wait a minute. <cf>Didn't you just say “Giant Dragon's Claw Marks”?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Trying it's not something to do with the dragon race?!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
They attacked to be indiscriminate attacking Holy sites of the Bafarian attacks in various places.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
I don't want to deal with such crazy people!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Wait, wait! There's no way they'd offer such a dangerous request to a rookie, right?
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
The target is not a dragon. <cf>According to eyewitness reports, it's a boar-like beast.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Hmm...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Rookies have a lot of expenses, right? <cf>If you have a daughter, it's even more so.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
You're really a busybody. <cf>If Only Your Caring Nature Could Be Conveyed to Muli...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Huh? <cf>Did she say something about me?
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Well, it doesn't hurt to take it. <cf>Delighted, I'm happy the pay is good.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
OK, the contract is dangerous. <cf>Please meet us at the site, buddy.

Npc_Jake
Player
By the way, what did she say about me?
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Meet at the venue. <cf>Okay, let's get ready and go!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
<span size="Big">Oh, wait! Please! </>

Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
I've been waiting for you. <cf>From here on, you'll leave me alone.

Npc_Jake
Npc_All
I'll show you. <cf>A TOPTOPPING BATTLE!

Npc_Jake

Npc_Feste

Can I hear you!?
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Well, well. If that makes you a good adventurer, then I'll pave the way.
?
Npc_Jake
Player
That's a very thoughtful thing to say. <cf>If you have any advice for your juniors, I'll listen to it!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
That's right... The “Giant Dragon's Claw Marks” are the largest Bafaria ruins in this area.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
IT'S SUPERIOR HIGHER LEVEL THAN THE LAKERID MINE. <cf>The Monsters Inside Are Strong and Stronger.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHECK YOUR “SKILLS”
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Hmm, a skill?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
The Skills Level Will Vary Scissors On How You Use Your Skills. <cf>It depends not only your safety but also the safety of your companions.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
If you can't make the best move when the time comes, you'll lose your reputation as an adventurer.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Skills, Imaginee, Items. <cf>Let's challenge after being fully prepared.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
That was really good advice. <cf>Well, that's Jake after all.

Npc_Feste

Thank you for teaching me. <cf>Don't worry to check your skills, servant.

At this rate, I'll soon have nothing left to teach you. <cf>I'm really happy to have such a reliable junior!

Stuck, I'll go home first.
Npc_Jake

It would be fine if Avaritia was the only one, but if more serious, we'd have to warn the town.

Npc_Jake

By the way... I got some serious information. <cf>I'll share it with you guys.

Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Recently, there have been sightings in various regions about sightings of unsightings. I've confirmed this once again.

Npc_Jake
Npc_All
There is quite a bit of information that argues it may be Avaritia.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Oh...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
And one more thing

Npc_Jake

THE PERIOD WHEN THE NUMBERS OF SIGHTS COINCIDES WITH THE PERIOD WHEN THE DRAGON RACE SIGHTS TO RAMPAGE
?
Npc_Jake
Player
Hmm... <cf>It's a bit complicated to dismiss it as a covert.

I've heard that dragon tribe are now terribly well-off, unlike before.

Npc_Jake
Player
I don't really want to Imaginee it...

Npc_Jake
Player
... Someone has Risen to the Top. <cf>And that person has the power to unite our beloved dragon tribes...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Well, this alone doesn't prove that the Dragons and Avaritia are related, but [--]
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
I'll continue to look into it.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
If you get any information, please let me know.
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
That's right. You should get some newcomers just in case you run into them.
?
Npc_Jake
Player
By the way, there is something I would like to ask you. <cf>Do you know the word “raija” (visitor)?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
No? I've never heard of it?
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Hmm... I see...

Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
More motivation, you see. It's about Muli,<cf>... what did she say about me, see?

Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Ah, that's right. <cf>[“] Jake's sleeping gaze is... ["]

Ugh...!

yeah? [visitor (raija)]?

Npc_Coin_Owner

Npc_Coin_Owner
wow, that's a clue... <cf>[visitor (raija)]... or...

Npc_Coin_Owner

Isn't that something of Bavaria religion?

Npc_Coin_Owner

Bavarianism...

MAV101_050_020_020
Oh, it's unusual for Ajin's daughter to come to the temple. Are you interested in the <cf>Bavarian religion?
npc_priest_1stClass
Npc_Feste
MAV101_050_020_021
That's because the Bavarian religion is open to a wide range of people, even to Ajin. If you want to listen to the <cf>story, you're welcome
npc_priest_1stClass

It's Mr. Walkin, a third-class priest in the Bavarian religion

Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
<cf>Is he a religious priest and a historian who studies the history of the Bavarian religion
}
Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
<cf>Well, that research went too far, so it was sent to a place like this, right?
}
Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
Leave it aside for now. <cf>My teacher is just like me, and he really doesn't have an eye for things related to history

I'm going to do a field survey this time too [“]! I said [”] and flew from here towards the ruins of the <cf>giant pagoda [--]

They haven't come back even after the scheduled date. <cf>So, I was thinking of submitting a request to the Development Bureau from now on

Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
<cf>Because Professor Walkin is full of research, and it's impossible to say that he can exercise, to put it bluntly

Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
<cf>I'm worried if I get attacked by a monster while I'm engrossed in the investigation...

<cf>However, because of their power, [visitors (raija)] were regarded as heretics in ancient documents, and were also sometimes regarded as people who cause disasters

sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
but! I've found a contradiction here!

sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
<cf>If you decipher the descriptions relating to [the visitors (raija)], there are many things that their powers and knowledge have in common with the founder of the Bavarian religion
}
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
<cf>In other words, the founder of the Bavarian religion was also one of the [visitors (raija)], and the other visitors lost a power battle with the founder and became stigmatized [--]

sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_All
hey, wait a minute. <cf>If all of a sudden it gets spooked, it won't get into my head at all!
}
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
<cf>Well... in other words, [visitors (raija)] indicate outsiders, and they have special powers...?
}
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
That's right! Also, there is a high possibility that the founder of the Bavarian religion was also a <cf>[visitor (raija)]!
}
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Here, I proposed a further new theory!
}
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
<cf>The special power that [the visitor (raija)] has is not God's power, etc., but further knowledge beyond our knowledge, that is...

sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
No, that's really too much of a leap forward, isn't it? <cf>What's more, that theory is subtly [old] about the founder, isn't it?
}
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
ah... that's right. <cf>I feel like I understand why the Lord was sent to Minsterhorn
}
Npc_Feste
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
I am! Because I believe in the founder and God! I just want to get to the <cf>truth!!

<cf>But the foolish priests who didn't understand it kept me away and prohibited me from entering all religious sites

Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
Oh, thanks guys! <cf>As you can see, the teacher is back.
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
And so, the discussion started Right Away [--]
Npc_Milene
Npc_All
The More We Look Into the “Ruins of the Giant Tower”, The More Thoughts It Goes. <cf>Don't you think so?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
That's why, teacher. <cf>How many times do I have to tell you that that tower is the tomb of the Bafarian civilization?
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
That's strange! <cf>In the first place, why do you want that it is a tower!?
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
It looks like a giant tower. You could call it that. <cf>But some say it's going to be a giant cannon!
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
Isn't that just what the teacher said?
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
There Are Also Traces of Something Being Shot! <cf>And judging from the angle, there are celestial patterns ahead!
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
So what does this mean...? Once Upon a Time, Assault Attack to Attack the God of Baphalia!!
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
That's why you get demoted.
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
So I'll answer back. If that's a cannon, <cf>where are the people who built it?
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
If they could make such a huge mess, the technology must have been passed down to the present day.
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Even though there has been a collapse of civilization and a decline in technology, those ruins are far removed from the current disaster level.
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
The same is true from the viewpoint of architectural technology. <cf>It is hard to imagine that a building of that size could have been built by invented.
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
If so, it's clear that it's a relic of the Bafarian civilization. <cf>And the tall tower has an important symbolic meaning.
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
'The [Mihashira] of [Kamigakari] and the Temple of Asterlies, <cf>many of the important aspects of the Bafaria their “height.”
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
In other words, “height” is a symbol of authority. The Ancient Mysteries class built Tombs That Scissors the Heavens.
Npc_Milene
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Grrr... Expecting you are my student<cf>, that is a brilliant rebuttal that even takes into cultural account the background...!
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
No, we can't fall behind here! <cf>There is a history of war between gods and the Bafaria gods.
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Npc_Milene
Not only historical events, but also the lives of people at that time provide clues [--]

Sorry, but before that, can you explain it to me?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse

Who are you and for what purpose did you come to this earth?

We have loved through time and space... <cf>I'm sure you can say that, right?

That's right. Tilis and I came from the future, 1000 years from now.

so? What is your purpose in coming from 1000 years into the future?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_060_130_201
... The Liberation of Avaritia.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_202
Avaritia is a distorted being. <cf>Just Being There Will Be Distort Space-Time.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_203
The [distortion] created by Avaritia is accumulated, and <cf>it will soon engulf this planet...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_204
These complaints have been confirmed in our time.

MAV101_060_130_205
What the heck?!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris

The Avaritia of our time has become so distorted that it is no longer manageable.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_207
But, 1000 years ago... in this era of Avaritia, it's still possible to do everything we can.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_208
We will find and free Avaritia, and overcome the <cf>[distortion] in space-time. [--]

That's why I came from the wrong future. <cf>To save this planet!

This story has become epic...
Npc_Feste

But is it OK to change the past? <cf>That thought like it would be a kind of troublesome...
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_212_ADD010
We have to worry about this matter.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_213
This plan was made after the impact and scope of changes that would result from the liberation of Avaritia, and the future of the planet.
Npc_Tyris

MAV101_060_130_214
So, we've told you all about us. <cf>Are you tired?

Yes, I wanted it. <cf>... Huh? Servant contract...? ? ?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
MAV101_060_130_245
Yay! <cf>I got a new servant!!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
MAV101_060_130_246
Eh? Servant? Wait a second...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
MAV101_060_130_247
I won't wait. <cf>This is the best festival's ☆
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_060_130_248
... Erinze-sama, let's just say these people <cf>
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_060_130_249
Fufu, isn't that great? It's helpful reassuring to have such a strong collaborator.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_060_130_250
Ahh...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_060_130_251
Okay! Well then, servant. Take care of your junior clothes and make sure they are of good use to me, okay?
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV101_060_130_252
what? You got caught too?
Npc_Tyris
Player
MAV101_060_130_253
Ah, that's why you've been calling me servant since then...
Npc_Tyris
Player
MAV101_060_130_254
Oh, so you're Tillis' senior! That<cf>'s reassuring.
Npc_Aerinse

Well then... I look forward to working with you for a while. <cf>“Senpai”
Npc_Tyris

Now, I have something to ask of your right away.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_060_130_258
It's okay. I won't tell you to move right away. <cf>Please take a break and call me when you're ready.

Have you had enough rest yet?

Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
If you were ready, I would like to talk to you about my request.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Now, let's get to the point.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
We have a device to search for Avaritia.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
But it happened to have been excited in the battle joke...
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Are you talking about “Omnistron”? <cf>Is it possible that thought it was wrong...?
/
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
No, it's okay. <cf>As long as we have the parts, we can manage it.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Just excited, is there anywhere I can get a “Luminous Core”?
/
Npc_Tyris
Player
<cf>Speaking of Luminous Cores, Aren't They Telling From the Machines in the Bafaria Heritage?
/
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
If you're looking for them around here, go to “Valley of the Machine Traces”
/
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Then, please collect those parts.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
What, we're going!?
/
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
I have the duty to protect Lady Elinze.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Then, let me join you [--]
/
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
No. It's not working. It's not working at all. <cf>It's just sleeping trouble.
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
Uh...
/
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
Sweetheart, Erinze-sama and I will wait here. <cf>I will leave it to you to gather the parts. End
/
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Oh dear, my new servant is a bit rough on people...
/
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Well, here we are, here we are! <cf>Let's finish washing parts cleaning!
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV101_070_013_023_ADD010
Okay, servant, go ahead and do it!
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV101_070_014_023_ADD020
Okay! <cf>I got the 'Luminous Core'!
/
Npc_Feste
Player
Now, let's deliver it to Tiris.
/
Npc_Feste
Player
Did you get the “Luminous Core”?
/
Npc_Tyris
Player
Ah, here it is! <cf>This should replace the broken part.
/
Npc_Tyris
Player
I will bring it into the Omnistron right away. <cf>Please wait a moment!

[PATH]705*\Scenario\MAV101_080.uasset[PATH]
I'd like to thank you on behalf of Tillis. <cf>Thank you
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD010
<cf>Actually, it would be nice if I could give you something proper, but...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD020
if that's the case... well. There's something I want to <cf>check
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD030
I said that people who come from the future are called “[visitors (raija)]”... but are [visitors (raija)] something <cf>[visitors (raija)] can understand with each other?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD040
Yes, me too. <cf>When you do Chronolip, special fluctuations occur in the biological engram for a while
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD050
Well, by the way [--]
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD060
<cf>When you first met this guy at [Mihashira (Mihashira)], did you feel that special fluctuation?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD070
huh?
Npc_Aerinse
Player
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD080
No, especially. <cf>I thought it was the one that had quite a lot of engram...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD090
hmm... that's right...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD100
Apparently, the Lord isn't a [visitor (Raija)]. <cf>Say something appropriate like Merloff
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD110
Merloff...?
Npc_Aerinse
Player
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD120
There was a response to the repaired Omnistron!
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD130
<cf>Abnormal reactions of engram can be seen in an area called the “Monte Nord Valley” in this period
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD140
Oh, did you discover Abalitia right away!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD150
Not sure, but probably. We need to go to the <cf>site and do some research
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD160
<cf>There must certainly have been a village called “Rize” in the Monte Nord Valley. It would be a good idea to aim there first
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD170
Seniors, please go to the site first and gather information. <cf>We will see how Mr. Ehlinse is doing and we are leaving
Npc_Tyris
Player
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD180
huh? what's this?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD190
This is Omnistron's slave unit. Please bring this with you. You will be able to communicate with <cf>us
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD200
I'll see you later in the village of Rize. <cf>Thank you for your support
Npc_Aerinse
Player
MAV101_080_010_000_ADD220
<cf>So if we head to Ritz, are we ready?
?
Npc_Feste
Player
But the Monte Nord Valley also has Abalitia. <cf>I didn't think Hoihoi would show up that much
?
Npc_Feste
Player
<cf>Dragon King is good, those guys from the future are good... what on earth is about to happen
?
Npc_Feste
Player
huh? Omnistron, wasn't it? It<cf>'s reacting to something
?
Npc_Feste
Player
[--] This is Tillis. Can you hear me, senpai? <cf>Please respond if you hear it
?
Npc_Tyris
Player
Ooh! That's right. <cf>Speaking of which, they said they could make phone calls
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
yes. Now you can share your location and information. <cf>That was great. It seems like it works without problems even in this day and age
?
Npc_Tyris
Player
That's not all. <cf>This way, if you do this...
?
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<It's Ehlinse. <cf>Has it arrived safely? ＞
?
Npc_information
Npc_information
What! The letters have come to light!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Is it possible not only to make phone calls but also to exchange letters? <cf>this is convenient, isn't it? As expected, it's a tool of the future
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
<cf>If we keep in touch with Omnistron, we should be able to proceed smoothly with the release of Abalitia
?
Npc_Tyris
Player
That said, don't let it be used unnecessarily in public. Please be careful not to <cf>stand out too much. Well then
?
Npc_Tyris
Player
What is that, so awful! they're not children, are they? Are you going to do an <cf>impersonation to show off!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
<cf>If I had to stand out, I wonder if you were dressed to stand out a lot!
?
Npc_Feste

?
Npc_information
Npc_information
hmm... <cf>Well, I can't even get angry if someone honestly apologizes like this!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Let's go, servant! they can't be helped. I'll tell you how to do things in this day and <cf>age
?
Npc_Feste
Player
oh? <cf>it looks like we arrived earlier
Npc_Aerinse
Player
MAV101_080_020_000
because Ehrinse-sama is in too much of a hurry...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_001
?
<cf>Because I thought if we didn't join up even a little sooner, I'm sorry for the inconvenience
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_020_002
that's right. <cf>Mr. Ehlinse has a little more dignity [--]
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_003
that was...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_004
Mr. Ain Rain
Npc_Priest
Npc_Einrain
MAV101_080_020_004_ADD010
<cf>That girl... was it “The Oracle Priestess” by the Bavarian Order...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
MAV101_080_020_005
Are you familiar with them?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
MAV101_080_020_006
That's about as much as we talked about it. <cf>Well, I thought they'd leave Ukiyo-e somewhere
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_007
<cf>But why are there religious shrine maidens in places like this
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
MAV101_080_020_008
it's a pilgrimage. <cf>Oh, they're going around sacred places and praying to God
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_020_009
Um... there are only that many girls like that?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
MAV101_080_020_010
<cf>It is said that in the Bavarian pilgrimage, the more severe the process, the more prayers reach the sky
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_020_011
Besides, there were attacks by dragon clans recently, right? <cf>Because of that, the air in the world is a bit rough
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_020_012
The brunt of anger is on the religious community, isn't it? <cf>[“] What is God who is supposed to protect the world doing! [”] and
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_014
people are afraid, aren't they? <cf>The dragons that suddenly became active, and Abalitia, which began to appear...
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_015
<cf>In order to appease that, they are probably going on a pilgrimage out of season and trying to [dispel (dispel)] distrust from the people
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_016
<cf>Actually, it would be hard for people to complain if such a girl was shown to endure good health. hey?
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_017
is it the god who protects the world...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_018
Do you believe in God?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_019
why is that all of a sudden. solicitation?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_020
That's not the case, but...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_021
<cf>If God really exists, why would some people be forced to put up with it or cause unreasonable things to happen
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_022
<cf>If my wish comes to God, I hope for a world where everyone can live equally
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_023
Mr. Ehlinse...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Aerinse
MAV101_080_020_024
Well, it's a dream
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
MAV101_080_020_025
But if you don't give up on your dreams, there are times when you can reach them. <cf>That's what I think

There will be no living eagles in the future...
Npc_Feste

Hmm, it's a cause to greet someone. How is <cf>Ehrinse doing?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_067
I'm sleeping now
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_068
<cf>The reckless Chronolip, the Abalitia liberation ceremony... it's probably putting more strain on your body than you can imagine
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_069
that's right... it would be nice if he recovered a little
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_070
um...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_071
What, what happened!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_072
<cf>Thank you so much for your help in Liberation of Abalitia
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_073
And I apologize for the initial rudeness
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_074
<cf>I made such a terrible choice... but still helped me in this way...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_075
Oh, you don't have to be that kind of awe. I'm not good at <cf>that kind of thing
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_076
For us, it's just a good way to beat boredom. <cf>Boredom doesn't make adventurers rotten. huh?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_077
I feel refreshed. <cf>I thought I'd have to properly apologize and thank you at some point
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_078
<cf>They're going to continue freeing Avartite with a similar feeling in the future, right?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_079
That's the plan. but... Dragon King...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_080
Voldigen? <cf>I can't believe there are monsters that eat Abalitia...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
MAV101_080_080_081
<cf>... no matter how strong the dragons are, can they eat Abalitia?
Player
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_082_M
<cf>... no matter how strong the dragons are, can they eat Abalitia?
Player
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_082_F
It's usually impossible, isn't it? <cf>But it's possible with Voldigen
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_083
<cf>This is because [--] Voldigen himself has already turned into Abalitia
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_084
what was that?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_085
<cf>The Voldigens were originally a sealed dragon family in this era
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_086
<cf>Did you know that in ancient times, there was a dispute between dragon clans and Bavarian tribes?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_087
Oh... it's close to mythology
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_088
It wasn't a myth; it was a fact. <cf>Voldigen was the dragon king of his time
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_089
<cf>After turning into Abalitia, the Dragon King, who was sealed by the Bavarian tribe, woke up in our time...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_090
<cf>I saw a dragon family that had declined incomparably with the past, and started a major war with the aim of restoration
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_091
<cf>At that time, they started eating other Abalitias to further enhance their own power
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_092
<cf>As a result, power, distortion... Voldigen goes beyond the normal boundaries of Avartier
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_093
Do they eat in the same family? I'm not horrified...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_094
<cf>However, if that's the case, Ehlinse, who is trying to free Abalitia, is nothing other than a hindrance to him
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_095
<cf>... the reason he appeared during this era was probably because they heard that we were planning to liberate Avartia
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_096
There's no point in freeing Abalitia, which powers you. <cf>So, trying to eliminate Ehrinse-sama...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_097
<cf>Incidentally, you can eat as much as you want in Abalitia in this era where distortion hasn't increased yet... or
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_098
<cf>If left alone as it is, Voldigen will gain more and more strength
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_099
<cf>And it won't be long before this planet falls under his control
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_100
<cf>So please... please protect Mr. Ehlinse's body together
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_101
<cf>May I be able to carry on with Mr. Elinse's will to protect all people who live on this planet...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_102
<cf>Please help me get to Abalitia before Dragon King and complete that liberation... please!
Npc_Tyris

Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste

Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV101_080_080_108
<cf>So, once Ehrinse is able to move, will they immediately head to the next Abalitia release
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV101_080_080_108_ADD010
yes <cf>Next up... certainly, it's a place called the “silent city” in this era
Npc_Tyris

MAV102_020_010_002
is that so? That was great...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
MAV102_020_010_003
Well, what are we going to do next?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
MAV102_020_010_004
Northeast from here... would it be a desert in this era...? There's an <cf>Avartia reaction there that should be released
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
MAV102_020_010_006
Desert... ah, is it the “Salamzat” one? <cf>there must certainly be a checkpoint along the way. Let's go through there
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
MAV102_020_010_007_ADD010
OK, everyone, are you ready? I'm going to head to <cf>the checkpoint
Npc_Feste
Player
Would you like to pass through the checkpoint?
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
<cf>If [--], you will need to be accompanied by an adventurer rank 6 or higher and, in addition to that, an identity guarantor
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
to? identity guarantor? <cf>Regardless of adventurer rank, there wasn't such a system, was there?
Npc_Feste
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
It started a while ago. <cf>... Look, there were a lot of things in “Bernhardt,” right?
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
<cf>So, Dunkirk, the leader of the Knights of the Principality, who acts on behalf of the king who had recuperated, came to say hello to Salamzart
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
<cf>Therefore, there was a request from the Salamzat side to make general immigration checks stricter
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
I see... I <cf>wonder if it's a time to worry about politics
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
Then, what about an identity guarantor or something? <cf>What kind of person should I ask for?
Npc_Feste
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
yes <cf>Basically a person who has obtained permission from the Salamzat side, or [--]
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_Feste
<cf>You will be a person who has lived in Asterlies for 10 years or more
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_Feste
Eh, it's bothersome — why is that [— —]
Npc_Feste
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
It's also troublesome for us to check them one by one. <cf>But since it's a rule, it can't be helped, right?
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_Feste
Anyway, a companion with an identity guarantee certificate and adventurer rank 6. <cf>This is the condition for passing through the checkpoint
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
So... is an identity guarantor applicable?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
Well, at times like this, it's probably Kointei's husband
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
<cf>Certainly that person must have set up a store over there since over 10 years ago
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Are you on good terms with that person?
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Oh, my eagle and my servant too. I'm going to <cf>make another loan to my husband, but there's no way to do it
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
<cf>If the two of you trust, we can also trust you with peace of mind
Npc_Aerinse
Player
Hmm. <cf>Well then, let's head off to Asterlies!
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Be <span size="Big">my guarantor! </>
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
it was all of a sudden!? Is it a debt from a dangerous place!? <cf>Joint guarantors are not allowed!?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
That's wrong! it's my identity. identity guarantor! It's <cf>necessary to get through the checkpoint!!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
ah? ah... is that it? They say Dunkirk is coming. <cf>Why are you guys going to Salamzart?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
Hmm, I have to use it for a while. <cf>However, I was told that I needed an identity guarantor
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
well, it doesn't matter, but...
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
<cf>There are quite a few betsu-san with them, but they probably didn't do anything wrong...?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
I'm not making a bad impression! <cf>I'd rather help people!!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
I'm saying [--], really?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Aerinse
Yes! <cf>Festa-san and the others are helping me
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Coin_Owner
<cf>Tillis, who is here, was also welcomed as Feste's new servant...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Coin_Owner
a new servant...
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
<cf>Yes, I also have my seniors, and every day I get guidance and encouragement every day

Let me think about the guarantor for a moment
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
I haven't done anything really bad!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
haha, just kidding. <cf>I know you guys aren't like that
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
... but there is one condition for becoming an identity guarantor
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
oh, what is it. If it's anything other than money, won't you listen?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
I want you to help fix this guy
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
huh? Imagine Seed?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
Oh, they destroyed it because of my carelessness. <cf>If this guy can't be used, it's going to be extremely troublesome
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
hmm... What kind of image seed is this?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
It's for getting in touch with my little brother
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
huh!? did your lord have a younger brother!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
ah. they took over my parents' house in place of me, my prodigal son. What, <cf>is it so strange that I have a family?
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
no, well... That's right, family...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
If that's the case, I'll accept it. <cf>So what do we need to fix it?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
It's “sparrow tree sap.” <cf>That's because you need a reasonable amount
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
It's a good idea to look for it on the Ritz trade route. It should be <cf>harvested well around there
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
I asked for it. <cf>If Imagine Seed can be fixed, it will either be an identity guarantor or a joint guarantor!
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
<cf>Leave this matter to us and the others, it would be better for the lords to take a break
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
No, if so, I'll do a survey of the surrounding area
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
That's right, you have to be careful
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Oh, did you bring me what I asked for? <cf>This guy saved me. Thank you so much!
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
let the experts do the rest. As long as you have the <cf>materials, there's no problem, right?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
ah. well then, as promised, I'll be your guarantor. <cf>Wait a minute
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
You got what you needed, didn't you
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Hmm. everything is going well. Haven't there been any changes in <cf>your husband's side?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Yes, there were no issues. It's all thanks to my seniors
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Here's the certificate. The <cf>Asterlize watermark is also properly included
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_All
Ooh! As expected! <cf>What you should have is a friend!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
<cf>... it would be nice if the husband could also interact with his younger brother through that Imagine Seed
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
That's right. <cf>Well, that guy just complains
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
It's good to take care of your family. <cf>If you're alone, you won't even be able to listen to your complaints
Npc_Feste
Npc_Coin_Owner
...
Npc_Coin_Owner
Npc_Feste
Well, this is the solution to the problem of identity guarantors. <cf>Now, let's go back to the checkpoint!
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Would you like to pass through the checkpoint? <cf>Now, let's take a look at the guarantor's certificate
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
hmm, hmm... You're doing it <cf>right, aren't you? That would be nice
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
<cf>Also, it seems like the Adventurer Rank also satisfies the regulations
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
[--] Yes, no problem. <cf>Please go through
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
<cf>Also, what about Adventurer rank... huh? Looks like it's still not enough
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
<cf>I'm sorry, but in order to pass through this checkpoint, you must be accompanied by an adventurer rank 6 or higher
Npc_barrier_gatekeeper
Npc_All
hmm... that was it. <cf>Servant, I have to keep training a little more
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
OK, now we can shake our hands and get through the checkpoint. <cf>The desert is right in front of us!
Npc_Feste
Npc_All
this dry wind... it's been a while
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste

I don't know which. <cf>But... I'm curious about you...
Npc_Einrain

Einrein has loved me with a hideout. <cf>There I can calmly think things through.

Oh, so that's what it means
Npc_Joerg
Npc_Einrain

Could it be that Carvain, who has a girlfriend, has a girlfriend?! <cf>I was so tired...

What does that mean?
Npc_Einrain
Npc_Joerg

No need to worry this! Well, you, <cf>Cavain has something on your hands, don't you?

Npc_Feste
Npc_Joerg
MAV102_040_010_019
The Oracle's Priestess Who Acts in Secret from Her Followers. <cf>A knight of the Duchy of Barnhardt with a secret
Npc_Feste
Npc_Joerg
MAV102_040_010_020
And then, the two of them must meet in secret...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Joerg
MAV102_040_010_021
...
Npc_Joerg
Npc_Feste
MAV102_040_010_022
Oh, come to think of it, I also met the Knight Commander Dunkirk in “Akatsuki no Mushitori de”
Npc_Feste
Npc_Joerg
MAV102_040_010_023
Was Dunkirk the Reason Carvain “Had to Change His Plans and Go Into Desperate”?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Joerg
MAV102_040_010_024
That is...
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
MAV102_040_010_025
I'm leaving them to look into something that I've been leaving about.
Npc_Joerg
Npc_All
MAV102_040_010_026
However, since this is a personal matter, I have asked Carvain to take a break from the Knights...
Npc_Joerg
Npc_All

If it is dangerous, I wonder if my father will strike me down.

father?

Npc_Joerg

So please keep this a secret from the Knights. <cf>I don't want my father to get angry with me either.
Npc_Joerg
Npc_All
MAV102_040_010_032
My father is especially strict with me and Carvain. He says things like, “You two should become great cornerstones of the Principality!”
Npc_Joerg

I'm glad that people have high feelings of me.

That young man is called Yoruk... he's quite a tired man.

You told us the truth. <cf>You don't want Dunkirk to know.
Npc_Feste

But... he didn't say anything about the important things.
Npc_Feste

Trying some truths can help obscure what you really want to hide... It's a technique I often use.

Npc_Aerinse

Please let us know

Npc_Aerinse

... About a strange old man
Npc_Tyris

A teenager old man?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
That person may have... <cf>Chrono Leap
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
What the heck?!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
I don't have any proof, but I think the doubt is pretty high.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
So where is the old man?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
It's a bar. It feels like he's poor, <cf>living room off the leftovers from the bar...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Hmm...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste
Chronoleap is a forbidden technique. <cf>We are going to leave it alone.

Oh, that's right! I'm sure you said so!
Npc_Feste

YES <cf>Only those who perform Chrono Leap should know.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
Then this old man...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
I ASKED PEOPLE AROUND ME AND THEY SAID IT WAS BEING HERE A FEW YEARS AGO AND NOBODY ASKED ABOUT ITS PAST...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
More, he is not very conscious and is willing to hold a conversation.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Hmm...
Npc_Feste

Old man, we have something to ask you.
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Old_Man
Why did you say those words?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Old_Man
It helps that you are adventurers. <cf>If so, would you like to accept my request?

Npc_All
If you can leave the wish of this old man who doesn't have much time left, <cf>I'll answer any question you want.
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
what? I thought we could have a normal conversation, but it felt out we're making a deal. <cf>So, what do you want to ask me for?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Old_Man

That's true. <cf>There's too little information...

["If you have any problems, come to me"] he said, so <cf>I'll ask him for help right away!
Npc_Feste

Why did you mutter, “May Alicia Bless You”?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Old_Man
... Please listen to a fairy tale while your broken brain is still clear.
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
Once upon a time, a very long time ago. <cf>There was a Priest in a Priest order.
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
The Priest had a woman he admired. <cf>However, the woman had lost most of her memories.
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
The Priest Wanted to Succeed Make the Woman Who Wants Her Days with a Blank, Expressionless Face Like a Machine Smile
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
It was at that time. The Woman Wants Mutter, “I Want to See 'Flowers of the Sand and Wind. '”
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
It was a tiny murmur. <cf>It was an unconscious murmur, like a sigh.
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
By Chance, the Priest heard this and set out on a long journey in search of the “Sand Wind Flower.”
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
And so he wandered about for a few years. <cf>He finally got the flower and married to the woman, but [--]
Npc_Old_Man
Npc_All
The Priest was Enveloped in a Enveloped Light and Was Enveloped to a Strange Land.
Npc_Old_Man

Npc_Old_Man

Npc_Frelbe

“Plan” huh... Tiris is also interested in it, but <cf>what on Earth is that?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Frelbe
... “Avaritiashell Project”
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Simply put, it's a plan to create a special Avaritia and control other Avaritia.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
Is that even possible?!
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
In theory. However, to operate the Avaritia Shell, a special bio-engram must be embedded into it.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
The Power to Synchronize with Avaritia while having a human heart [--]
Npc_Tyris
Npc_All
That can't be...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Yes... it's Lady Elinze.
Npc_Frelbe
Npc_All
The plan is to make Elinze the Boss of Avaritia in order to control her.
Npc_Frelbe
Npc_All
Huh!? Elinze is your [Princess], right? <cf>Is it okay to do something like that!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Tyris
Of course, it was exciting. Was it dangerous or Avaritia could be controlled...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
In the end, things happen down when Elinze-sama jumped back in time and freed Avaritia.
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
Lord Bachelard also said that he would respect the bride of the [Princess]... <cf>It's true, it wasn't a pleasant experience...
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Feste
That was supposed to have Elinze, release Avaritia and activate the bioengram.
Npc_Frelbe
Npc_Tyris
That way the fusion rate with Avaritia Shell will lose. <cf>In other words, everything went according to Bachelar's Plan.
Npc_Frelbe
Npc_Tyris
No way...!
Npc_Tyris
Npc_Frelbe
That's all for now. <cf>Let's get to the lab before Bachelard does something long!

Today, they're finally talking about closing down the store.

Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
what?! You're closing this place?! <cf>Why is it so exciting?!

Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Don't worry. We've tried that I'll be in charge of the house. This is a place of rest for adventurers.

But... Dad, <cf>I hope you're not getting caught up in anything strange...

Hey, has anything else changed? <cf>Anything is fine. Even something small is fine.

Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
why? No... well... <cf>Oh, that's right. Have you heard about the Assassin of the Duke?
?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
The Duke's Assassin? <cf>Isn't King Barnhardt Recuperating from an Incurable?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Hey, when was that information? <cf>The King was assassinated during the Dragon Tribe's Attack on the Principality.

Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
The Main Culprit, A Member of the Knights, Carvein, Is Wrath Out in Asterlies, Wrath a Commotion.

Npc_Jake

Carvain Assassinated the Duke!?

Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Ah? Ah Haven't you seen the wanted poster? <cf>That's a pretty big bounty, right?

Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
What do you mean... When were we here, the sovereign wasn't assassinated...?

I don't think Carvain is the kind of guy who would assassinate a sovereign...

He didn't say that smart! <cf>If anything, I think Yoruk would be more clever.

Npc_Feste

Let's enjoy and find Merlouf. <cf>If you're looking for someone, the best place to go is the Reclamation Bureau.

Huh? Are you looking for the Assassin of the Duke too?

Npc_Adventurer

It's been going to be a lot tired. Well, it's like there's a pretty big bounty on offer, so <cf>I'm sure any adventurer would be happy.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
No, what we're looking for isn't Carvain, but someone called Merlouf.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Female_Member
He's a boy with a teenager eccentric air about him. <cf>He must be tired in Asterlies.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Female_Member
Are you Mr. Merlouf? I'll look into it.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Hmm... I can't think of thoughts. <cf>It feels like that no one has come to the Reclamation Bureau.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Hmm, I see. <cf>Have you seen it before?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Female_Member
YES The Guards at the Town Gate Square might have some ideas.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
There is a crime that an assassin to kill the sovereign may be there, so patrols and security have been stepped up.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
They're leaving people coming and going, and even the Barnhardt Knights are on Patrol.
?
Npc_Adventurer
Player
It helps to be a direct order from Knight Commander Dunkirk. <cf>It feels like I'm being stared at, it's dying.

Player
Dunkirk and Carvain... <cf>Is the Assassination of the Duke really true...?
?
Npc_Feste
Player
[--] No, there's nothing we can do about it now. <cf>More cafes, Merrouf and Avaritiashell

Npc_Feste

Let's go to the town gate square. <cf>I'll ask the gatekeeper if he knows anything about it.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Sorry to hate you when you're busy. <cf>I'm looking for a guy named Merlouf.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gatekeeper
He was rather an odd-looking boy, lying <cf>a little oddly...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gatekeeper

Npc_Feste
Npc_Gatekeeper
Hmm, I haven't seen it around here

Npc_Gatekeeper

Do you have any idea about the Knights?

Npc_Gatekeeper
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
Hmm... I May Have Seen Him During My Patrol <cf>He was a boy who became pregnant otherworldly.
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
Player
Oh, that may be it! Where was he?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
The arena. I called out to him, but he was talking in a roundabout way and I couldn't get the gist of it.
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
Player
Well, I'm afraid it won't do any harm...
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
Player
Just to be sure, this Melrouf. <cf>Do you think he has anything to do with the assassin of the Duke?
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
Player
That's not true. If it was, I wouldn't ask you about it in front of you.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
That's true... I'm sorry. <cf>Please feel that this is a joke.
?
Npc_Barnhardt_Knight
Player
Things are pretty tense. <cf>I still can't believe the Duke was assassinated.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gatekeeper
But it's true. The Guard and the Reclamation Bureau has also received requests for suggestions from the Knights.
?
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
I HOPE THE ASSASSIN IS FOUND SOON AND THE ASSASSIN CALMS DOWN.
?
Npc_Gatekeeper
Player
That's right... <cf>Sorry for the bad guys. Thank you for wanting me to know.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gatekeeper
Well, let's search around the arena!
?
Npc_Feste
Player
Hey, it's been a while. <cf>... You've grown to have grown since last time.
?
Npc_Merlouf

After all, you are more efficient than the people here...

Npc_Merlouf
Player
You're still talking nonsense. <cf>Now you'll have to listen to what I have to say.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
Tell me. Where is Avaritiashel?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
...?
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
THE YOU FROM 1000 YEARS IN THE FUTURE TALK ME THAT YOU WOULD KNOW THE LOCATION OF AVARITIASHEL!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
Me 1000 years later... Ah, I see... <cf>So that's what that reaction was about.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_Merlouf
... Did You Guys Make That?
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
what? You've got to be kidding me! If I had the technology to make something like that, I'd use it to make money first!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
Yeah, well, that's true. <cf>That's how you guys feel.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_Feste
... Good. <cf>It was not you who made that.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_Feste
If that were the case, I would have loved him without even using him.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_Feste
...!
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
THE FACT THAT YOU RECEIVED ADVICE FROM ME 1000 YEARS IN THE FUTURE MEANS THAT <cf>YOU'VE COME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT...
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
In that case, there is no reason for me to lose to hate. <cf>If we don't do something about that, civilization will be destroyed.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
... please tell me. <cf>Where is Avaritia Shell?
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Merlouf
About half a year ago, an explanation of engrams was relaxation in the underground of <cf>Saint Baphalia Island.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
That's wrong what you're looking for.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
Ah...!
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Aerinse
Avaritiashell breaks through space-time without using a chronogram. That relaxation the relaxation to shift!

Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
So history has changed in those six months...!

Npc_Feste
Npc_All
Let's Head Underground to Saint Baphalia Island. We must check the status of the Avaritia Shell as soon as possible!
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
If you want to go to the underground of Saint Baphalia Island... “The [Cathedral] of [Divine Blessing]”, you should start from the Temple of Asterlies.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
The [Temple of Divine Blessing] is the temple of the Bafaria blessing. <cf>There should be a telemetry device there.
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
How many times I've asked this, but I'll ask again. <cf>Who is the hell are you?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
He doesn't even show any signs of surprise when he hears that it's his future self. <cf>He'll still look the same 1000 years from now...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
And there seems to be some ambiguity about this guy's true identity. Can you tell me why?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Merlouf
That is...
?
Npc_Merlouf
Npc_All
Huh?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Feste

It's getting in the way of us getting close to [Mitsuka (Mitsuka)]
Npc_Einrain

<cf>Because of that, we can only build a barrier from here

Moreover, they were also part of a dangerous group that manipulated the assassination of Duke Norbert and killed to take over the principality...

I don't like to judge people based on judges. <cf>I'll see for myself whether Carvein is a good or bad person.
Npc_Jake
Npc_Charlotte
thank you...! Thank you, Jake!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Jake
By the way, Jake, do you have room for two more people on the boat you're sleeping?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Oh, you guys too... The King's Assassin and the Oracle's Priestess. <cf>This case thought more thought than I thought.
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
All the right. I'll talk to a captain I know. <cf>Come to the port when you're ready.
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
The reward is... well. I GUESS YOU CAN JUST TELL MY STORY MULEY ABOUT MY HEROIC DEEDS.
Npc_Jake
Npc_All
Okay. I'll tell her I've fallen for the new girl.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
No, it's true that Miss Charlotte is cute, but <cf>I'm married to my girlfriend! Stop worrying things like that!!
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Oh, so you thought it was cute?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
You idiot, stop it! ? Don't say it! ? <cf>Don't say it at all! ?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Yes! You're here. I've tried to be the captain. <cf>Let's go to Barnhardt on this ship!
Npc_Jake
Player
Oh, wait. This is a trading ship, right? <cf>Are you planning to enter Barnhardt's port so bold?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
No way. We'll sneak off on the way. <cf>There's a fishing village called Kanaloa near the castle.
Npc_Jake
Player
Oh, I see. You're doing great! <cf>It depends the “top of the top” label isn't just for show.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
... But what about the crew? <cf>I can't find them anywhere...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
That's the problem. <cf>I caught the captain, but the crew wasn't there.
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
In these times, right? Regular ships are also stopped. Who would go to Barnhardt?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
Either he's a complete idiot or a brave man...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Okay, I'm sorry. We'll take care of the crew. <cf>You, please prepare for shampoo with Charlotte.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
ok! But is there an address for the crew?
Npc_Jake
Npc_Feste
I can't think of any right away, but I'm sure there are many people who lost their jobs because they can't go out to sea.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Jake
Servant, I'll run all over the city to find someone
Npc_Feste
Player
It doesn't matter what your thoughts or background are you. <cf>Just gather some crew members!
Npc_Feste
Player
The men at the port were so scared of the naval blockade of the Duchy of Barnhardt that they all came ashore.
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
Thanks to you, I can't get a job. <cf>I'm soldiers of soldiers and knights, I can't go out to sea!
NPC_Commonwoman
Player
That's what you're talking about... are you a sailor?
Npc_Feste
NPC_Commonwoman
It's similar. I'm a ship's engineer.
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
No matter how old or wild it is, there's no engine I can't train.
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
As long as the ship leaves, I'll take you anywhere. <cf>As long as the ship leaves
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
For example... Giving the Duchy of Barnhardt?
Npc_Feste
NPC_Commonwoman
... What don't you listen to? <cf>It was Barnhardt who stopped the liner?
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
And you're ignoring to ignoring that and getting on... <cf>What on Earth were you thinking!
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
I like you guys! <cf>I want to go out to sea with some guys with some guts like that!
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
Please come along for the ride! <cf>You can leave the care of the engine to me!
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
You're leaving to get past Barnhardt's Naval Blockade, right? <cf>No one but me can turn the engines on!
NPC_Commonwoman
Npc_Feste
After all, only a hand can handle a ship's engine.
Npc_Feste
Player
I think I've found something strange. <cf>Okay, let's keep going like this and gather the rest of the crew.
Npc_Feste
Player
You may have found something interesting.
Npc_Feste
Player
Well, that's enough. <cf>Let's go back to Jake's place.
Npc_Feste
Player
Ahh... I'm in trouble.
Npc_Commonman
Player
Even the regular ferry service has stopped... <cf>Is I Wonder If Moms OK?
Npc_Commonman
Player
Aren't you a sailor? <cf>You must be very sweet.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
Maybe he lost his job because the ferry service stopped?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
Yes, that's right. <cf>I'm also thinking about not having a job.
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
I have a family home in Barnhardt. <cf>My Mother and Sister Live is there.
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
My mother is old and my sister is in poor health. <cf>So I used to go and check on her every time I went to work.
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
I can't do that trouble. <cf>I don't know what's going on in the principality, and I'm just thinking...
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
Hmm... Just in case. <cf>If I told Barnhardt to set sail, what would you do?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
I would love it if you could help me with the work on the ship. <cf>You might also want to stop by my parents' house.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
what?! Slowly? <cf>That means... Stowaway, right?
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
Well, it's hard to say it out loud. <cf>We have some business with Barnhardt too.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
Even if we keep waiting, there's no reason when we'll be able to go.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
That's true... <cf>It would be happy if I couldn't see my family again.
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
I'm not sure... but okay, I'll go along with it. <cf>Can I get on the boat too?
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
I'm sorry about my family, they're important to me. <cf>I'll go and see them even if it means taking a risk!
Npc_Commonman
Npc_Feste
That's good spirit. Well then, don't worry. <cf>I'll make sure you're not blamed.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
I hope you can meet your family musicians
Npc_Feste
Npc_Commonman
Now, let's find the rest of the crew!
Npc_Feste
Player
Well, that's enough. <cf>Let's go back to Jake's place.
Npc_Feste
Player
Dead end?
Npc_Gentleman
Player
It's like my life...
Npc_Gentleman
Player
I Came From the Feelings of Kanaloa to Do Business in Intrigues of Getting Rich Quick.
Npc_Gentleman

But unfortunately... <cf>Sorry. Leave me alone.
Npc_Gentleman

Npc_Feste
Npc_Gentleman

Npc_Gentleman
Npc_Feste
Oh, wait! Wait a sec!! <cf>Is that true? Are you guys going to set sail?
Npc_Gentleman
Npc_Feste
YES It would be nice if a local person could show me the way.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Gentleman
Leave it to me! I'll show you around as much as you want! <cf>I'll do anything to get back to my senses!
Npc_Gentleman
Npc_Feste
Oh, God of Buffalia! thank you! <cf>I'm finally free from this dead end!
Npc_Gentleman
Npc_Feste
I don't know why, but I think I hate someone. <cf>Well, that's good. Let's keep going crew members.
Npc_Feste

It's too similar for that. <cf>It's like...

Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Aerinse
No, nothing. <cf>That can't be true...

Is this a coquette? <cf>There's something about this that strange odd...

Yes, please. <cf>I'm leaving you to save my life. As many times as you want.

Npc_Charlotte

Erinze. <cf>Take a look at what's inside the shower.

I don't really care about it, but it's amazing.

Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Aerinse
Yes...! <cf>Thank you, Charlotte.

Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Charlotte
Now, let's head to the [Mihashira] of [Kamigakari]. <cf>We must not let this kindness go to waste.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Charlotte
Well... I just wanted something tired.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
We're going to go back in time and never come back, right?
?
Npc_Feste
Player
So then, this incident... <cf>Aren't you borrowing it and not being able to return it?
?
Npc_Feste
Player
There's no need to worry about that.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
If we destroy the Chronogate, <cf>Chrono Leap will never be possible.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
In other words, there will be no future for us to borrow from Charlotte here.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
We will never be able to jump into the past.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
So, the new future Charlotte will have the shampoo <cf>in her hand and it will be there.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Hmmmmmm... <cf>Well, that thought, and then this thought...
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Sweetheart, <cf>Charlotte's Thoughts Will Drown in Your Courtesse, Right?
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
YES I guarantee that.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Okay then! <cf>I can't just borrow it and leave it like that.
?
Npc_Feste
Player
If it feels good in Charlotte's hands, I'm relieved. <cf>Thank you, I'll use it.

Npc_Feste

Looking up at the [Mihashira] like this is always when it's time to say goodbye.

Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Isn't that okay? <cf>We can't meet Tirith from the past.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
We'll never see each other again... <cf>This is our final farewell.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
... I'd be disappointed if I said I wasn't lonely.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
But if it hurts her. <cf>If it hurts her from getting into this nightmare shampoo [--]
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
It is my greatest joy
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
It's okay. The Past Me and Tiris Can Still Be Together.
?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
... I'm tired. Then I won't say anything more.
?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Tiris... <cf>Please give me another me.

Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Aerinse
PLEASE WAIT A LITTLE SHORT. <cf>We can all travel together again, laughing together.

Npc_Feste

... I was an orphan. <cf>They said they were holding this pendant when it was picked up
Npc_Charlotte
Player
<cf>So, this is my parents' only clue, but I don't understand anything else
Npc_Charlotte
Player
was it a chronogram...? <cf>I didn't even know it was inside
Npc_Charlotte

Can you tell me what it's like next time? Because it <cf>might tell me something about my parents

Npc_Jake
Player
The annual “Star Spirit Festival” is coming soon, isn't it? <cf>Let's just enjoy it once in a while!
Npc_Jake
Player
It's a festival where people from all over the world gather. <cf>We are also thinking about a special menu
Npc_Jake
Player
<cf>Why is Chance the perfect place to sell the name “Double Sided Coin Tei”!
Npc_Jake
Player
<cf>So, how did the Bavarian tribe procure chronograms?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
<cf>Chronograms are refined from large amounts of engram [--], especially those based on human thoughts
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>In the past, people used the power of the Bavarian religion to collect that engram
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>The power of religious groups was also being cut down in my time, so it didn't come true at all, making it a valuable thing... ah
Npc_Aerinse

<cf>Um, Jake just said “Star Spirit Festival”!
Npc_Aerinse

Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
That's right, the “Star Spirit Festival” is still going on here... If so<cf>, we might be able to do something about it!
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>The Star Spirit Festival is a Bavarian festival, but the real purpose is different
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>It gathers the thoughts of many people and creates “offerings to God”...
Npc_Aerinse

Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
... No, I think it's a good opportunity. <cf>Let's talk to both of you about the situation
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>Right now, Einlein's safety has led to Tillis's stability

Well then. Now that I understand the circumstances [--]

Now, this time it's time to save Tirith. <cf>Let's go back to the past as soon as possible
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>For that, we need an offering to God [--] chronogram, right
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Aerinse
That's why, Einrain. <cf>Lord, don't you have any offerings?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
I'm so sorry. I don't know... <cf>Everything like that is managed by Rugherio
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
Where is that Ruggerio now?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Einrain
<cf>Today, there was a discussion between the chief priests... so I think it's about time I went back to the Temple of Asterlize
Npc_Einrain
Npc_All
hmm. So let's go back to the temple. I wonder if it would be bad to <cf>stay here too long
Npc_Feste
Player
I'll go back too. <cf>Well then, Einrain. nor
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Einrain
Mr. Tillis, please, Einlein. <cf>Can I come and see you again?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Einrain
yeah. I want them to come back. <cf>Charlotte too... be careful
Npc_Einrain
Npc_Charlotte
Is it an offering...
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_069
If that's the case, everything is dedicated to God after the Star Rei Matsuri is over
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_069_ADD010
If I could give it to you now, it would be about these fragments

Very, this alone...
Npc_Aerinse
Player
MAV105_020_040_071
Isn't there going to be a star spirit festival this year too? <cf>If possible, could you give me an offering to make at that time
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_072
(Shake your head left and right) Hmm...
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_040_072_AD_RYU
<cf>As for that matter, it was decided earlier that the Seiryo Festival would be canceled
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_073
I can't get the “Star Spirit Diva” necessary for the Shinto ritual
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_074
The Diva of Seiryo... isn't the main character in Seiryoi Matsuri!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_075
To make an offering, you'll need three divas
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_076
However, they both died during an attack by the Principality. The <cf>one left hurt his throat and went back to his hometown...
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_077
YES!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_078

Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Charlotte

how is it?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_081
<cf>Sure, you seem like quite a singer, but you need qualifications to be a diva
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_082
Please take a look. This offering [--]
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_083
if it's responding...!?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_084
... could it be that I will pass?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_085
<cf>... it's amazing, but it looks like you're qualified to be a diva
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_086
(Laughter) Whoa!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_086_AD_CRL
I did it! Well then, one person is decided
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_087
Hey, wait a minute! <cf>You're being targeted by armed groups, aren't you?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_088
If you do something that stands out like singing at Seiryo Matsuri, then again [--]
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_089
they think they might be attacked? <cf>Of course, there's that risk, but...
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Carvain
MAV105_020_040_090
More than that, we need a chronogram now, right?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_091
Ain Rain is also stretched, isn't it? <cf>If so, I also want to do what I can
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Carvain
MAV105_020_040_092
That's it!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_093
<cf>This is the best chance to sell the beautiful Charlotte, an up-and-coming traveling diva who is rapidly rising in popularity!!

Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_093_ADD010_ADD_RYU
... it can't be helped. Please don't be reckless
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Charlotte
MAV105_020_040_094
Yep! no!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
MAV105_020_040_094_ADD010
<cf>Wouldn't it be possible to have a star spirit festival if the divas were arranged in this manner?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_040_095
(nods puzzled) Hmm...
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_040_095_AD_RYU
Alright! <cf>Let's gather two more people at any cost!
Npc_Feste
Player
MAV105_020_040_096
<cf>One of the divas is decided by Charlotte... there are probably two more
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
It was a story about one person hurting his throat and going back to his hometown. <cf>Is it not possible to bring him back?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
<cf>It is said that there is a medicine that works well in [Sato (Sato)], but there is no news that it has improved yet
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
That person's name is Lala Forte. I'm drawing <cf>the blood of “Forest People”
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
<cf>Actually, the religious group and the people in the forest are having some kind of problem...
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
<cf>People involved in the cult are not allowed to enter Lalaforte's hometown
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
So, are you going to Lalaforte alone?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
It will be so. <cf>As for communication, there is no choice but to wait for it to be sent over there
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
<cf>If that's the case, it might be quicker to leave from here while we wait and see
Npc_Feste
Player
<cf>If you're looking for Lalaforte, head to Cape Rahwehara
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
The forest people's [village (village)] is in [the outer continent (outer continent)]. <cf>Cape Rahwehara is the gateway to that
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
Use this offering when identifying singing voices. It <cf>should shine just like Charlotte
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
Here, too, let's look for someone who has the qualifications to be a diva
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
We, too, would like to go to the Star Spirit Festival. It's an important Shinto ritual that <cf>honors God
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>Even if not as much as the shrine maiden from the Oracle, the Diva of the Star Spirit is also an essential part of the cult
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
Well then, let's get right to it! If it's <cf>Cape Rahwehara, there must be a liner leaving the harbor
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
wait a minute. Is the Lord going too!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Charlotte
of course. they're the kids who sing along. <cf>I have to check it properly with my own eyes!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Feste
I'll go too. <cf>Your escort isn't over yet, is it
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Charlotte
Carvine...
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Carvain
I'm sorry. I'll stay here. I'm worried that <cf>Tillis's condition has suddenly deteriorated...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
<cf>There is also a possibility that the incident at [Mihashira (Mihashira)] had an impact...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_All
Hmm, that's right. Contact me if anything happens

What, do you know each other?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
This person is Bernhardt's high-ranking civil servant, Mr. Hugo. <cf>Right now they are rebuilding internal affairs in the Prince's [near (soba)]
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
it should have been... but...
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
What happened to the guard? What are you doing here?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
I don't want you to look at me that way. <cf>I came here for work. It's an inspection
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
Currently, I'm planning a migration plan from the Principality to [Outer Continents (Outer Continents)]. <cf>I was just gathering information about this area
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
Right now, I'm listening to a lot of things from a woman's point of view. This wouldn't be enough <cf>with the Grumpy Knight, right?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
from a woman, well... Then I'd like to ask one question. <cf>It's called Lala Forte around here...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Oh, there's a beautiful lady over there too! <cf>Excuse me, I have a few questions...
Npc_Hugo
NPC_Commonwoman
Mr. Hugo! <cf>... what is that person
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
is that Barnhardt's high-ranking civil servant...? Isn't that <cf>some kind of mistake
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
Oh look, Mr. Hugo is an excellent civil servant. The <cf>politics of the Principality cannot be discussed without that person
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
I really don't think so, but... <cf>Anyway, would you like to ask about Lala Forte
Npc_Feste
Player
hey, lord. <cf>If that were the case, wouldn't it be detailed about the women who live around here?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Of course it is. <cf>How passionate do you think I treated women
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
<cf>There's nothing I don't understand about women in this area!
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
what are you exaggerating... <cf>So, do you know a woman named Lala Forte?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
Please draw the blood of the people in the forest. They should have stopped by <cf>around here
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
lara forte... <cf>Oh, maybe it's about the Star Spirit Diva?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
<cf>I heard that they live in a [hermitage (hermitage)] outside of the village
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
It seems like a pretty exotic beauty. <cf>Unfortunately I haven't been able to meet you, but I'm fascinated
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
Speaking of which, Carvine. <cf>You also have a pretty beautiful woman with you
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
is that her? Which is your <cf>favorite, Mr. Einlein?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
Damn it, it's not like that! <cf>she's my target of escort!!
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
hmm. Yes, that's right. There isn't an <cf>escort target [at (·)] [then (·)] [or (·)], right
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Carvain
huh? huh? Why are you mad!?
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Charlotte
So, what is it actually?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
no, that... I was looking for a diva to <cf>hold the Star Spirit Festival
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Hugo
oh? <cf>I've heard from the new chief priest of Barnhart Diocese that this year's Star Spirit Festival will be canceled
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
No matter what, it's because the number of divas doesn't match
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Carvain
I'm going to be a diva!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Hugo
... you?
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Charlotte
YES! Please come listen to it if you like!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_Hugo

Npc_Hugo
Npc_Charlotte
Now that I have the energy to work, I'm going back to the inspection
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All

My throat is feeling great right now! No thank you!!

(Notice) Huh!
Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_100_267_AD_MIL
Ah, Transcendental Beautiful Girl Festival! <cf>Also, the adventurer who helped the teacher!
Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_100_268
What if...! Was the <cf>diva candidate Millaine!?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
MAV105_020_100_268_ADD010
Apparently, it seems like it~
Npc_Milene
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_100_268_ADD020
Do you two know each other? If so<cf>, it's a quick conversation
Npc_Ryugerio

MAV105_020_100_269
(Being pressurized) Ah...
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_269_AD_MIL
How about it. Could you please accept the <cf>Star Spirit Diva case?
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Milene
MAV105_020_100_270
As you can see, you are qualified to be a diva

Npc_Milene

eh... and...
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_271_ADD005
I'll ask for it from the eagles too! <cf>For some reason, I want to hold the Star Spirit Festival at any cost
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
MAV105_020_100_271_AD010
that's right... <cf>Well then, can I ask for one of the exchange conditions?
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_272
Recently, I found an unusual “metal plate” in the ruins. <cf>I wonder if you can bring it to me
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_273
No matter what! <cf>I want it, but I couldn't get my hands on it because there are monsters
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_274
The location is the innermost part of the “Tower Rock Mine Ruins.” It's a <cf>bit strange ruins that were discovered recently
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_274_ADD010
The way I see it [--]
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio

Wow, got it! <cf>If that's about it, I'll do something
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene
MAV105_020_100_275
<cf>However, once you have seen that metal plate or something, please pay it to the religious community
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_100_276
The ruins are under the jurisdiction of the religious order. <cf>If there's nothing wrong with the relic, I'll return it later
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_100_277
Hooray! <cf>If you can show it to me properly, that's fine
Npc_Milene
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_100_278

Npc_Feste
Player
MAV105_020_100_279
The “metal plate” example is at the back of here, isn't it? <cf>... well, Millaine is also rough on human use
Npc_Feste

Well, it's not a big hassle. <cf>Dad's gonna find it, my servant
Npc_Feste

Ah, no, that... I knew it when I noticed it...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Milene

... Speaking of which, it's strange, isn't it? <cf>Even though I forgot everything, I only remembered this song...

MAV105_020_160_311
Thank you for collecting divas
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
Thanks to everyone, it seems that the Star Spirit Festival can be held
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
That doesn't mean the concerns have disappeared
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>So I'm here for a consultation, and I'd like to ask everyone for their continued cooperation
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>As for the case of the armed group that was being investigated here, as a result, the details are still unknown
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
MAV105_020_170_316
<cf>... but since Charlotte started walking out with you, the number of unknown faces has increased in the city
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
MAV105_020_170_317
Originally, Asterlies was a city full of people coming in and out. <cf>but... it seems a little too intense
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
MAV105_020_170_318
If it were Seiryo Matsuri, the number of people would increase more and more. <cf>are you alright?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_170_319
<cf>The area around the diva will be guarded by a group of [elected (eh)] carefully selected guards
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_170_320
It is said that Mr. Carvine will also cooperate
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_170_321
<cf>Also, it was decided that knights would be dispatched from the Duchy of Barnhardt
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_170_322
It is said that an apology for the previous incident was included
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_170_323
<cf>I would be grateful if both of you could ask for security assistance
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_170_324
Of course it is. Leave it to me
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
MAV105_020_170_325
Hopefully, I won't be able to finish the Star Rei Matsuri safely
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
MAV105_020_170_326
From now on, the Asterlies Star Spirit Festival will be held! <cf>Notify all believers!

Once it was opened, preparations progressed at a rapid pace. It<cf>'s probably what everyone has been waiting for

Okay, and There is some time until the stage starts. Let's take a look around the city for <cf>a bit

Npc_Jake
MAV105_020_190_330
<cf>It's certainly easy to break, but I don't think there are many people who split it in units of 100 sheets? it's some kind of talent...
Npc_Jake
Npc_Aerinse
MAV105_020_190_331
well, well. Husband, <cf>I'll reimburse for what this person divided
Npc_Hugo

(What is that? It looks like that) huh
Npc_Jake
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_332_AD_JAK
He's not a suspicious person. <cf>It's just simply unbearable to see a beautiful person in trouble
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Jake

Oh, what! Not only is it <cf>beautiful in appearance, but also in the heart!
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Aerinse

This is fate. What do you think? Even if it's light tea

(Hand held) Ah...
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_335_ADD010_AD_ARS
<cf>I wouldn't be able to regret not being able to meet someone like you again in the face of the ruthless flow of time

Npc_Aerinse
MAV105_020_190_336
eh... eh...?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_336_ADD010

(Watch the festival) Ahhh
Npc_Jake

Npc_Hugo
Npc_All

Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_339
(Laughter) Hmm
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_190_339_AD_HUG
So what are you doing here?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_340
As an envoy from the Principality, I came to inspect the Star Spirit Festival. I want to make up with <cf>the cult
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
MAV105_020_190_341
I thought I'd lend out the Principality's soldiers and let them do part of the security. I have the expenses here as proof of <cf>apology
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
MAV105_020_190_342
<cf>The cost of lodging, food, and even souvenirs for the soldiers they brought in fell to Asterlize, and the economy also revolved! The religious community is also prosperous!
Npc_Hugo
Npc_All
MAV105_020_190_343
I'm a hard working guy who always thinks about everyone. <cf>So, let's go have tea

Don't take our employees carelessly!
Npc_Jake
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_345
<cf>Carvine is also in Asterlies, so why don't we invite them here?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_346
(Reluctantly) Huh!
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_190_346_AD_HUG
I don't like that kind of stubborn man. <cf>Aren't they going to preach again
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Feste
MAV105_020_190_347
It can't be helped. I wonder if I'm going back to work...
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Hugo
MAV105_020_190_348
Oh, but the religious community also has cute shrine maidens, yeah
Npc_Hugo
Npc_Hugo

Well, I'm sorry for this. <cf>You're a beautiful person, again someday...

Npc_Jake
MAV105_020_190_352_ADD020
By the way, it's Ehlinse. <cf>I'm not going to interfere with the Lord's will to work part-time, but...
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
that look... hmm... <cf>So you're going to go to the temple?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Ah, that's right. <cf>You can't just wear your work clothes
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
<cf>It would be disrespectful if you don't dress for the time and place
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
We will be changing clothes, so please wait a little while
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
Whoa whoa whoa. I can remember Tillis's hard work

Npc_Charlotte

I think it's interesting, but what about seniors?
Npc_Milene
Npc_Lalaforte
<cf>It's about deviating from the rules of the religious community, and it's something that should have stopped in the first place, but...
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_Milene
<cf>Rather than dozing off at an important Shinto ritual, I wonder if it would be better to bring just the right amount of stimulation ♪
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_Milene
I heard some kind of unsettling conversation, is that okay?
Npc_Feste
Unknown
don't worry about it. <cf>Because I'll finish it properly until the offering is made
Npc_Charlotte

Oh, I'm looking forward to it. <cf>However, don't just overdo it

Alright! <cf>Well then, let's do a final check and gather in the dressing room when we're ready!

Npc_All
Alright! I'm going to <cf>captivate everyone with my song!
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
Charlotte is lively, isn't she
Npc_Aerinse
Player
that's all right. Let the Lord watch over from the audience
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Eh, is that OK?
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
Leave the security to the eagles and Carvine. You should <cf>enjoy the festival without worrying about the Lord
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Well, let's check with Ryugelio one last time
Npc_Feste
Player
<cf>I thought this year would be difficult, but this is how I can dedicate a song to God
Npc_Lalaforte
Player
This is all thanks to all of you. <cf>Thank God for meeting you!
Npc_Lalaforte
Player
<cf>According to what I hear, everyone is asking for offerings to God
Npc_Lalaforte
Player
The Diva of the Star Spirit also has a role in creating offerings
Npc_Lalaforte
Player
This Lala Forte will help you until the end. <cf>Please, may God bless you
Npc_Lalaforte
Player
<cf>When it comes to the final check, the more you check the lyrics and the motions, the more uneasy you become
Npc_Milene
Player
<cf>At times like this, don't think too much about it; Dawn works better!
Npc_Milene
Player
Even so, I don't think I'm the Diva of the Star Spirit. <cf>What's more, Charlotte is with her
Npc_Milene
Player
<cf>I sometimes earn money by singing to raise funds for my research, and I also get to know a lot of traveling entertainers
Npc_Milene
Player
I was also told about Charlotte-chan's own song
Npc_Milene
Player
That's right! <cf>I'll tell you the song that was written on the metal plate last time as a thank you!
Npc_Milene
Player
<cf>heh heh... if this dragged Charlotte into the swamp of ancient history...
Npc_Milene
Player
Oops, this wasn't the time to talk for nothing. <cf>Come on, focus! focus!

ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ♪
Npc_Charlotte
Player
Alright! It's getting exciting! <cf>After all I like this kind of air
Npc_Charlotte
Player
It's the same as before I got on the stage, and my strength springs up naturally. <cf>It makes me feel like I can do anything
Npc_Charlotte
Player
Of course, I haven't forgotten about the attack. <cf>But wouldn't that be scary now
Npc_Charlotte
Player
You guys are following me. <cf>I have to do what I have to do
Npc_Charlotte
Player
I'm fine. If you don't mind, call out to everyone
Npc_Charlotte
Player
Let's definitely make the Star Spirit Festival a success. <cf>I won't let weird people get in the way!
Npc_Charlotte
Player
Under the name [“]..., I hereby declare that the event will be held. <cf>With the God of Bavaria, Ein Rein [”]
Npc_Einrain
Npc_Ryugerio

Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Einrain
<cf>However, once you have made your declaration, please return to the cathedral immediately
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_Einrain
I know, that's my duty
Npc_Einrain
Npc_Ryugerio
Oh, it looks like preparations are going well here too
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
this is everyone... I'd like to say that <cf>everything is going well, but...
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>Actually, the identity of the armed group in this case is still unknown...
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>Mr. Carvane said he'd like to talk to you
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>It's packed at the entrance of the theater, so please stop by later
Npc_Ryugerio
Player
<cf>Well, I'm getting ready too, so excuse me
Npc_Ryugerio

mentors. Thank you for your hard work!
Npc_Carvain
Player
Carvane. What about security?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
Oh, no problem. <cf>Charlotte and the others are well-guarded
Npc_Carvain

<cf>If your master joins you, no matter who your opponent is, they will fight back and forth
Npc_Carvain
Unknown
Festa-san? What did you do
Npc_Aerinse
Npc_Feste
Hmm. <cf>I feel like I'm getting too distracted by the Little Charlotte stage
Npc_Feste
Player
<cf>The armed group is targeting Charlotte, so it's natural to strengthen stage security
Npc_Feste
Player
<cf>I feel like if I only keep my eyes on that, I'll run into an unexpected blind spot
Npc_Feste
Player
Certainly...! As expected, he is the master of his mentor. <cf>Noticed a good place
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
In fact, security efforts are concentrated on the stage. There are minimal arrangements in <cf>other places, but...
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
From the attacking side, it might seem like a no-brainer
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Feste
I'll leave the stage to Carvane and the Lord. <cf>Other than that, I'll take care of the eagle and my servant
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
The ones that can move the most freely are the eagles
Npc_Feste
Npc_Carvain
I hope I can help you too... In the <cf>field of battle, they actually drag their feet
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>It's better not to worry about your husband and enjoy Charlotte's sunny stage
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
If you stay at the theater, Carvine will protect you. <cf>it's safer for us, too
Npc_Feste
Npc_Aerinse
Oh, leave it up to me. <cf>I won't let them like anything
Npc_Carvain
Npc_Aerinse
Please be safe
Npc_Aerinse
Player
<cf>We're security guards for the temple, because there's also a back entrance to the theater

Npc_Feste

The Star Spirit Festival has ended successfully. <cf>Thank you very much for your help
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
<cf>With the power of the new diva, we were able to gather food for offerings more than usual
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Well, everything didn't go as planned, but...
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
The offerings are currently being refined. Please wait for a <cf>while
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
<cr>The divas are dedicating their songs in a special room
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
Once that's done, the offering will be completed
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
It's not going to be right away, is it
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
But maybe it's a special room that creates a chronogram... <cf>I'm a little intrigued. There seems to be a treasure
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
Actually, that room is a corner of the temple
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
<cf>If they had been destroyed by an attack at the Star Spirit Festival, offerings could not be refined
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
what was that?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
no way, those guys... <cf>Did they know that and attacked the temple?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Ryugerio
I don't understand. Only a small percentage of people <cf>know about the existence of the room
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I don't think a single rogue would ever know...
Npc_Ryugerio

An Attack of the Poison Taken by the Armed Man Attack that Laraforte was the poison.
Npc_Ryugerio
Npc_All
I think that poison is “Grizonia grass”
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_Feste
It had a unique sweet smell. <cf>It is a rare flower that can only be found at Cape Lawehara.
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_Feste
It can only be found at Cape Lawehara...? <cf>Can we buy it?
Npc_Feste
Npc_Lalaforte
No, only locals know about it. <cf>It's dangerous, so no one wants it.
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_Feste
There's no way I'd sell it. <cf>It's that strong a poison.
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_Feste
On the other hand... it doesn't mean you can take a life.
Npc_Feste
Npc_Lalaforte
To eat the flavor of Grizonia grass, it must be ground fresh.
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_All
Maybe their hideout is near where they grow.
Npc_Lalaforte
Npc_All
Um... can you take me with you?
Npc_Charlotte
Npc_All
I can be a decoy. <cf>It might make it happen to find their location.
Npc_Charlotte

To be honest, I'm honest... <cf>I also want to know their true identities

Very well. Then, believe my power may be small, I would like to be proud in your fate.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Adventurer with the Flame of Destiny in his eyes. <cf>I would like to give you some advice about “classes.”
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
You should be well aware that adventurers have a variety of fighting styles.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
YOU YOURSELF HAVE A CLASS AND ARE DEFESSIONALLY YOURSELF TO PERFECT YOUR SKILLS.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
But mastering the way is not easy
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
As long as you stick to one class, you will not be able to be able to be that class.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Essentials and relaxation other classes is the first step to relaxation the true nature of a class.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
From now on, I will talk about “Class Change”
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
The Essence of the Royal Road to the Pinnacle of Class. <cf>It will help you.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
First, about motivation. <cf>Owning a weapon is essential for class change.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Do you know where the weapon shop is? <cf>It's laundry on the first floor of the shopping mall.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
I'm heading out. <cf>Let's talk again there.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Welcome <cf>Now, let me tell you about class changes and explanations.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
When changing classes, prepare the weapon of the new class in advance.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
If you don't have a weapon to use, you can't fight.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Don't forget to prepare something that you can equip. <cf>IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET EXPERIENCES FOR ALL CLASSES.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Decent can be destroyed from these stores or <cf>destroyed yourself.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
In any case, it is now possible to avoid avoiding where you don't have a weapon when changing classes.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Thoughts, I thought [--], but talking in front of the store might be a bit of a nuisance.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Let's change the location. The Second Floor of the Bureau of Reclamation is good. <cf>I'll wait by the stairs
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Thank you for your hard work. <cf>Now let's talk about the details of class change.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
You can change classes by yourself. <cf>Try it when you want it.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
However, the levels of the classes are different. <cf>It's a basic thing, but please be careful.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
You need to be especially tired with classes you are tired for the first time or classes that are lower in level than your current level.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Because your combat ability will return according to your level, <cf>if you go out into the battlefield without defeating it, it will lead to an extremely challenging.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
There is a high motivation that you are switching to a weapon that you are wearing with. <cf>If You Are Using The Same Feeling As Feeling As Feeling, You May Be Feeling.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
To Calmly Judge the Judge You Find Yourself in
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
There is a lot of value in multiple classes. <cf>It will bring you a lot.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Frontline or Realline? Even just that change can make a huge difference in how you view the battlefield and how you handle it.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Please learn about the various classes through class changes.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
That's all my advice. <cf>Don't forget to remember it from time to time.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Good luck. <cf>May Light Shine on Your Path to Victory
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
I'm spending my time here relaxation the path of relaxation arts.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
There may be another opportunity to give you some advice. <cf>I would be happy if you could come and visit me then.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
May there be light on your path. <cf>[Don't slack off, keep moving forward.

Even if I get it back, <cf>as long as I'm here, I'll never reach the pinnacle of beauty!

My partner's head is still full of flowers. <cf>Should I spray herbicide up his nose?

Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
Haha! By the way, I had a great idea for “[Watageshō]”!

Npc_Waren

Npc_Waren
Player
... I see

Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
That's a good idea for Varen. <cf>It will also help promote “Watagesho”.
?
Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
If it's just the sweater of one garment's worth of “cotton fluff,” <cf>your master will look the other way.

Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
If you want, I'll give you permission. <cf>Why not give it a try?

Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren

“[Cotton Crystal]” is an unstable engram crystal. <cf>It will melt and melt over time.

Npc_Carnera
Player
Huh? Wait a moment, Carnera. <cf>If the “[Cotton Fluff Crystal]” shampoo...

Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
It seemed like we were closing to seeing something fun, but <cf>it seemed out to be a very disappointing result.

Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
Oh my goodness!! My bunny suit was such a fleeting dream!
?
Npc_Waren
Player
But Varen's idea was a good one. <cf>And so a large amount of “cotton fluff” was shampoo.

Npc_Carnera
Player
Once again, we would like to thank the Adventurer and present him with a small gift.

Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>Our master, “King Collector,” has given us a new order!
=
Npc_Waren
Player

Our husband, “King Collector,” is trying to make a cushion with <cf>“[cotton wool (cotton wool)]”
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
After all, this is so fluffy from “[cotton wool crystal (cotton wool)].” You'll be able to <cf>create the best fluffy cushions
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
It's like a dream story, isn't it! You'll be <cf>wrapped up in fluffiness, and you'll be able to take a good nap!
=
Npc_Waren
Npc_Carnera
<cf>However, “[cotton wool crystal (cotton wool)]” will disappear over time
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>The cushion will also run out, so my husband will eventually wake up on the floor
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Oops, that's like a dream in another sense!

Npc_Waren
Npc_Carnera
[“] I want <cf>to take a nap with supreme fluffiness, even for a limited time ["]
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
What shall I call this without saying greed? It's <cf>our husband's tearful greed
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>So “King Collector” instructed me to procure fabric to be used for cushions
=
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>I need the ultimate fabric that wraps around the finest fluffiness and won't let go away!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>When I looked it up, I found out that I could find the perfect material at a place called “Floating Island in the Void”!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>Nonetheless, “Floating Island in the Void” is a place where extremely dangerous monsters appear
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
ha ha! That's where it is! <cf>I'll gather materials, so I want adventurers to do something about monsters!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>You'll need 3 materials, so you'll need to try “Floating Island in the Void” 3 times too!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>While Adventurers are fighting, Varen will somehow gather materials
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
So don't worry about this. Please focus on the battle in <cf>“Floating Island in the Void”
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>The “[cotton wool crystal (cotton wool crystal)]” attached to the material is counted as collected by adventurers
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
This is your chance to get lots of “[Watagesho)” too! <cf>Please take care, Adventurer! ha ha!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
I want to collect cushion materials for “Floating Island in the Void.” <cf>Will Adventurers fight monsters?

Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>As for the ingredients, I'll secretly follow along and collect them, so it's fine!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
Try “Floating Island in the Void”!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
I need 3, so I have to go 3 times though. <cf>But it should be worth it!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>The “[Watagesho]” we found together will be collected by adventurers
=
Npc_Waren
Player
This is your chance to get lots of “[cotton wool crystal (cotton wool)]”! <cf>Now, let's go to “Floating Island in the Void”! ha ha!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
ha ha! Adventurer! <cf>You came back safely!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
Thank you so much for “Floating Island in the Void”! <cf>Thanks to that, I was able to complete my mission too!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
Great job, adventurer! It looks like they also got the material for the <cf>fluffy cushion
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Even if it's a giant, round body that swells to the limit due to “King Collector”'s greed and laziness!
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
splendid! <cf>It will be the supreme cushion that softly supports and wraps around
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
ha ha! <cf>Even if the “[fluff crystal (cotton wool)]” disappears, the cushion's fabric should remain untorn!
=
Npc_Waren
Player
Let's feel that my husband is also a remnant of his fluffiness. <cf>Thank you so much!
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
The Adventurer's achievement is also the Adventurer's <cf>“[fluff crystal],” which Varen collected while almost turning into charcoal.
=
Npc_Carnera
Player
We are still recruiting for “[Watagesho)]”! <cf>Please collect more and more and exchange them for Rock Paper Scissors!

Don't worry. I didn't use the “shampoo of the blue scent.” <cf>The flowers on my partner's body are from the relaxation area.

However! Even though it's the same thing, there are some things that you feel just sit back and watch!

Especially when it comes to the relaxation rituals that the Mooks plan to use the “Manners of Seikun”!

M
Npc_Waren
Player
G
I'll give you plenty of thanks. in the form of exchanging it for a <cf>gorgeous prize
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>It's a coin made by our husband without permission, so it would be a problem if it was used at a store
M
Npc_Waren
Player
If you don't collect it, it's likely that many people will scold you. <cf>If you don't mind, I want you to lend me your help! ha ha!
M
Npc_Waren

ha ha! Hey Adventurer. Nice of <cf>you calling out to us!

Welcome, Adventurer. <cf>Since you can get along with our husband's hobbies?
M
Npc_Carnera

Oh, what if you don't know about this great opportunity? <cf>this is disrespectful! First, let me introduce myself!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>I'm the servant of “King Collector,” who is a wealthy person and a great collector, Carnera!
M
Npc_Carnera

<cf>Our husband, “King Collector,” has a bottomless desire to collect!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>When I find something I'm interested in, I rake it up without hesitation!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>If the adventurer brings it, we'll exchange it for a great prize!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>These gorgeous prizes are rare items, masterpieces, and valuables taken from “King Collector”'s warehouse!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Adventurers, too, have a great chance to get valuable items at a great value!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>What my husband caught his eye this time was the “King Collector Coin”
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>No, rather than saying I caught my eye... is it correct that I had no choice but to keep an eye on it?
M
Npc_Waren
Player
After all, my husband made his own coin!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
As far as I could see at a glance, it didn't even look like a gold coin. <cf>Actually, it's a toy made by my husband, Doraku!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Anything [“] once is enough, so I wanted to experience the feeling of being a collector [”]
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>I've thrown my personal wealth in a flashy way, and gradually made tons of coins that have no particular value!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>That “King Collector Coin” was secretly stolen the other day!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>If you're treated poorly as treasure or used for shopping, you're likely to get scolded from all over!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>That's why I was ordered to collect “King Collector Coins”
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
Adventurers, please cooperate too! <cf>Of course, rewards are available!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Depending on the number of “King Collector Coins” collected, we will exchange them for great prizes!
M
Npc_Carnera

Npc_Waren

Why don't you slay about 5 bodies and collect coins! I'm <cf>asking for your best regards, haha!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>It looks like the bandits in the “Andorra Basin” have “King Collector Coins”
M
Npc_Waren

Let's collect it first! <cf>Defeat 5 bandits!
M
Npc_Waren

Npc_Waren
Player
Thank you so much for your quick response! <cf>As expected, it's in the hands of an adventurer!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
oh? <cf>It looks like the collected “King Collector Coin” is flickering
M
Npc_Waren
Player
Or rather, it's too shiny and dazzling, isn't it? That's what <cf>I'm saying, but my assertiveness is intense!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>It seems that my husband made it shine as a bonus because it would be lonely if it were just a coin
M
Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
By the way, when you bite a coin, it shines most strongly
M
Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
It doesn't bite coins, but what is it for?
M
Npc_Waren
Npc_Carnera
even if I ask?
M
Npc_Carnera
Npc_Waren
...
M
Npc_information
Npc_information
<cf>Even I don't know what it means, but I'm sure it's a “King Collector” kind of obsession!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>In the first place, the meaning of collecting things made by oneself is also unclear
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
Adventurers, please go out with me too. <cf>We'll never let you lose money!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Oh yeah, please bring this “Ai no Hibi Fukahi-kan” as a sign of “King Collector Coin” collection
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>It's an accessory for gently coaching opponents who have taken away coins!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>“King Collector” went out of their way to tell them that it's not good to take human things!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>If you have that kind of time, it would be better to think about a collection method, but I don't want you to touch on that story!
M
Npc_Waren
Player
<cf>Please note that “Love Whip, Fukahi-Gan” will be collected after a certain period of time has passed
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>If you clear a specific adventure board, you can get the same type of accessory that can be used indefinitely
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>As a trial period, we would be happy if you could enjoy the comfort of “Love Whip Fukahi - Limited”!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Now, let's start punishing those who don't arrive and collecting coins!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Please collect lots of “King Collector Coins” and bring them to us!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
<cf>Exchange them for great prizes and make sure adventurers don't miss out on this great opportunity!
M
Npc_Carnera
Player
ha ha! Adventurer! <cf>Are “King Collector Coins” collected?
M
Npc_Waren
Player
after all, it's been stolen in large quantities. <cf>We're also investigating where and who has it!

6
Npc_Carnera

I stole something from someone else, so I guess I felt a little tired.
6
Npc_Waren
Player
It felt like he was tired with a fair amount of force, so it<cf>'s true that I felt a bit sorry for him!

It seemed that ``King Collector Coin” was the cause!

It's a joke that you'll get an upset after eating something so stupid.
6
Npc_Carnera
Player
Could you please chase away from the Highland Fox from “God's Hill” and collect the coins?

By the way, “King Collector Coins” can be found in many places!

Npc_Carnera
Player

They may look like gold coins, but in reality they have no value!
9
Npc_Carnera
Player
Even an adventurer would be troubled if they received this as a reward for a quest.
9
Npc_Waren
Player
However, it got mixed up with the arena prize money!
9
Npc_Waren
Player
What if, after going through a fierce battle and a beautiful victory, what you got in your hands was a fake coin that just glowed for no reason?
9
Npc_Waren
Player
If it were me, I might destroy the arena in the name of “King Collector”
9
Npc_Carnera
Player
Haha! That's a piece of cake for Carnera!
9
Npc_Waren
Player
Even if it doesn't go that far, I think most people would be angry!
9
Npc_Waren
Player
'King Collector' is also meant to be scolded from various kinds for being a troublemaker!
9
Npc_Waren
Player
I think it would be good if my advice was given a good thought at this point.
9
Npc_Carnera

9
Npc_Carnera

Npc_Carnera
I have to agree with the story that my partner and partner are on the same level.
9
Npc_Carnera
Player
It just doesn't cause a bad feeling, <cf>or some say that Varen is better.
9
Npc_Carnera
Player
Haha! I don't mind being afraid!
9
Npc_Waren
Player
Thank you Adventurers! <cf>Please continue to collect “King Collector Coins”!

If it's made by a proper craftsman, it's craftsman. <cf>Well, it looks a bit rough, but it's funny.

It's a bit busy to ask out loud. <cf>Seems, there's something I'd like you to bring in a secret.
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
That's right... “crab”
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
Shhh! You're too loud! <cf>What if someone hears you?
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
Asterlies is famous for seafood. <cf>I think adventurers often eat it too.
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
But crabs are an exception. <cf>They're not even sold in the market, are they?
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
Crabs eat anything, so they are hated by fishermen because they “devour the sea”
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
There is a meal that if you eat a crab, you will start to eat anything in the same way.
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
That's why eating crabs is taboo in the Baphalia Temple in Asterlies.
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
However, strictly speaking, it is just something we avoid eating, and it is not something that is forbidden by doctrine.
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
And this isn't Asterliese, so <cf>it's fine to eat there too!
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
Well, when I felt it, I was tired. <cf>If I get posted to the garrison, I can eat crabs!
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
Well, the problem is that I can't move from here, so I can't get the crabs...
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
So, I asked the Adventurer, <cf>can you get me a cup of 'Astergani'?
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril

Hehehe. Experts count crabs as “cups”. <cf>Did you know that?
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril

“<value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>” I think the only way to catch them is to go there. <cf>I'm proud of them at waterside points!
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
It's not sold at Asterlies, so please give it to me. <cf>Please don't tell me something else!
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril

<cf>'Aster Crab' is not sold in stores, so I think the only way to catch it is at '' <value type="locationName" id="fld001_E"/>

Player
I'm excited about them at waterside points. <cf>PLEASE DON'T TELL TELL!

Player
Wow! A huge “Aster Crab”! <cf>You Got Caught One for Us, That's Amazing!
6
sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril
Player
It was worth visiting the Adventurer. <cf>It's rare to see a crab.
6

If You Live in Asterlies, You Won't Be Allowed to Eat It Because It's Bad Luck.

The miso inside the shell is also delicious. <cf>Huh? Why do you know so much about it?

sq101_032_step0_npc_Cyril

Well, I heard it from someone who spoke it.

The More I'm Told Not to Eat, The More I Want to Eat. <cf>There are quite a few people like that.

And yet, after the pilgrimage is over, they came along to a doctor like me.

sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Oh dear... <cf>I'm sorry for showing you such a noisy place.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
As a teenager. <cf>I am forecasting to realize “weather forecasting.”
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
Tomorrow's weather... but also <cf>I want to be able to predict weather changes.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
As a daily routine, I forecast the weather for the next day. <cf>It will be sunny for the next few days.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
As I was afraid that, it started raining, so the lady struck me with lightning.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
It means that he can't predict the rain or thunder. <cf>... yeah, I'm not that good at it.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
Alright, there are simply not enough emotions. <cf>The accuracy of the forecast is so low that it is not accurate.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
So I would like to ask you to conduct weather events in the Asteria Plains.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
I'll tell you some locations now. <cf>Go there and start this recorder.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
Because it's a Buffalian legacy, it will record anything you need to know. Easy, right?
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
It's an amazing item, so please don't lose it or break it.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
People who are tired to research are far removed from money. <cf>Oh, don't worry, we can provide you with a reward.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
I can observe the area around Asterlies, so I'd like you to observe from afar. Thank you

... My Family was once on a liner bound for Barnhardt when we got caught in a storm.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
The Ship Sank and the Family never fails. <cf>If only the storm had been busy... I still wish that
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
It may be presumptuous for a person to know the future. <cf>I have been asked if I want to be God.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
It's also a laughing matter. If You Want to Know What the Weather Will Be Tomorrow, It's Much More Accurate to Expect on a Fisherman's Intuition.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
But if we continue to observe the consequences, we will be able to predict the predictions of the consequences and droughts.
:
sq101_040_start_npc_feodor
Player
Sunny or rainy? I don't know the right now, but I still need a weather forecast.

I put the seal of the asterlies Assembly on it, but <cf>my package went missing...

... Oh? Adventurer. <cf>It looks like you have a luggage tag. what is that?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
... Feeling it up in Bahamar Valley? <cf>And your luggage was tired by monsters,
S
Npc_Giresse

That may be a package that is meant to arrive at our mansion.

Npc_Giresse

Adventurer. <cf>Are you free right now?
S
Npc_Giresse

My shampoo is in some trouble. <cf>If you don't mind, could you please help him?
S
Npc_Giresse

Once again, my name is Butler Jiles. <cf>Please be aware of this.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I serve Congressman Dalton of the Asterlies Assembly.
S
Npc_Giresse

Did you know?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
M
He is a man who is dedicated to the Port of Asterliese.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
He is also an independent trader and trades goods through various routes.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
However, the most important package never comes close...
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
The ship was about to kill, so <cf>all the passengers were out of anger.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
What you found, Adventurer, is the luggage we are looking for.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Could you please take me to that place?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Let's get our luggage up before our luggage gets stolen again.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Could you please take me to the location where the <cf>luggage tag in “<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>” was it totally up?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
This is the luggage that the adventurer found.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Yes, it helps to Senator Dalton.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
... There are goblin footprints all around.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
There were no bloodshed, so the <cf>people who were there were survivors it must have escaped.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
What's left...? <cf>Let's take a look inside
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
This is... a goblin fur. <cf>No, but... there are too many of them
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
This box is the same as the other one. <cf>All the materials are from Goblins.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
The fact that you got this much means that you put in the same amount of effort...
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
...
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Expect me, Adventurer. <cf>Could you please bear with me a little sweetheart?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
In the Port of Asterliese there is a warehouse owned by Senator Dalton.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I'd like to check the contents there as well.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I can open the warehouse door. <cf>Let's head to the port of asterlies.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
The Warehouse Owned by Senator Dalton is furnished in the Port of Asterliese.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Let's go check out the contents of the warehouse.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
This is Senator Dalton's warehouse. <cf>The next thing should still be there.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I'll check inside, so please wait here.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
[--] Sorry to have kept you waiting. <cf>I have checked all of your luggage.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
As Expected, A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONSTER MATERIALS WERE STORED THERE.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
The same as the one relaxation in the Bahamar Valley
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Especially goblins, mooks, ogres... <cf>There are people to be a lot of demi-human monsters.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
That's how many they feared.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I Heard That Some Adventurers Are Hunting Demi-Soulders More Than Shocking to Surprise Materials...
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I was excited to see that trade route led by Senator Dalton had been established.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
... Have you tried yet?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I was sent to the residence of Senator Dalton by a strange source to his background.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Because I have been able to find I have been able to find the Lawmaker's Transactions,
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
If Senator Dalton buys materials at a high price, more people will bring materials there.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
That's how many monsters will be angry.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
But will the monsters just keep getting beaten up one-sidedly?
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
... Yes. <cf>It is not unfounded to think of revenge against revenge.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Maybe the reason they ransacked the luggage this time was to recover the bodies of their friends...
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Defeated, this May Lead to a Major Conflict between Persecution and Demi-Dispute.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
This is not a personal issue for Councilman Dalton, but a helpful solution is needed.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
Thank you very much. <cf>Thanks for relaxation me with relaxation information.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
What you see here must not be shared with others.
S
Npc_Giresse
Player
I'm sorry to have dragged you into this, but <cf>adventurers please be willing of your thoughts too.

We are tired to tired Senator Dalton's background.

Chefs, The Head Chef has been given me a task
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
I have to suggest a dish for the wedding celebration.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
So, I cooked to make a salad, but I was told to <cf>submit it again.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
“You don't have enough feelings of blessing.” <cf>But I have no idea what that means...
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
That's right. Adventurers, why don't you try it once?
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
I want to hear the thoughts of many people. <cf>I'll prepare it right away, so please!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
... what do you think?
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
Want it to be a bit more chewy? <cf>It's true that the texture is a bit monotonous.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
A feeling of blessing... the texture is monotonous... <cf>... Ah, I see!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
That's it, Adventurer! <cf>I've got an idea!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
Sorry for this sorry request. Adventurer. <cf>Could you please bring me some “Pear Nuts”?
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
It's a little far away, but <cf>these are nuts you can get in Montegnor Valley.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
If you have “Pear Nuts,” your salad will be complete. <cf>thank you!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
'Pear Nuts' are nuts found in the <cf>'<value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>' in Montegnor Valley.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
With this, you'll have a salad perfect for a wedding!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
PLEASE
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>You Pear Me Some “Pear Nuts”
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
Well, then, plate the salad... <cf>All you have to do is eat some “Pear Nuts” on top and it's done!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
... Okay. What do you think? <cf>Try it now!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
... Is it delicious? I'm glad! <cf>Thanks to the Adventurers!
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
The Pear Nuts feature of “Pear Nuts” is that the two nuts are packed together like they are close together.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
Also, since the fruit is tired by tearing it off by hand, it is also known as “chigiri fruit”.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt
Player
The “Fruit of the Promise” that keeps two people closer together... <cf>I thought it would be perfect for a wedding gift.
2
sq101_044_start_npc_burt

The head chef was also prepared to eat this

sq101_044_start_npc_burt

Every time we work, there's always smoke, so it's a source of relaxation.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
?
What I want is to have a new kiln shampoo. <cf>I'm thinking about getting a new smoking kiln soon.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
The new kiln is a legacy of Bafaria, and <cf>it can smoke food in an instant.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Smoking is delicious and preserves food, but it takes a long time to make.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
It would be amazing if you could do that in an instant. <cf>I'd love to try it.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
So, I asked a friend of mine to repair it.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Sheri is a restorer of the Bafarian heritage. She's just an apprentice.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
I'm working at Lalpal and I need you to pick up my kiln.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
If you tell them it's Paulette's request, they'll admit it. <cf>Thank you in advance.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Please collect the kiln from Siri in Ralpal.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
I'm looking forward to the kiln
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
You're Paulette's messenger. <cf>It's the smokehouse, right? It's been busy.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
But there are some strange legacies.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
I have a friend named Milène who is a history.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
According to her, the Bafaria civilization must have had a ton of food dishes
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
There's no need to go to the trouble making homemade food.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
Because it was delicious, or because he made it as a hobby. <cf>He said those were the only ones he could think of.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
The Bafarian civilization is truly amazing, even going so far as to create a device like this for that purpose.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
Oh, sorry. <cf>I got lost away.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
This is the smoke oven. Also, to operate it, you need a “Large Smoke Stone”.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
Could you please collect those too on your way home and <cf>deliver them to me?
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
“<value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>”. <cf>Three should be enough, so please
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
The “Large Smoke Stone” that powers the kiln can be found at <cf>“” <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
I think I can get it when I collect the ore
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
Once You've Been Them, Deliver Them to Paulette in Asterlies Along with the Kiln.
E
Npc_Siiri
Player
Welcome back. <cf>Did you get the kiln from Siri?
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Yes, this is it. <cf>It's the Buffalia Instant Smoker.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Oh, even the “Large Smoke Stone”. <cf>That's right. Thanks
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
The first instant shower item is a gift to the adventurer.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Which one, start it. <cf>Let's start it.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
<span size="Big">...! ! </>
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
... Wow, that was a lot of smoke. <cf>Spice, relax
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Everyone was in a frenzy, scared if it was a fire, an eruption, or a monster invasion.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
And then I got really angry
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
As for the important part, the smoking, <cf>this was done in a flash.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Chop... yeah, this is soup.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Phep. The heat, or rather the amount of smoke, is all messed up.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
The fact that it doesn't break is a testament to the Buffalo Heritage.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
You can't really use it in the city. <cf>But it would be a big problem if it happened a forest fire.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
And then... the sea?
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
If we were in the middle of the ocean, we might not cause any trouble.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
... do you think they think we're lost? <cf>I see. It looks like a firefight.
E
Npc_Paulette
Player
Decent, there is a room for relaxation. <cf>I'll talk to Siri about it again.
E
Npc_Paulette

Thank you very much. I'm excited for your help. <cf>If I make some delicious delicious delicious food, I'll share it with you.

It's a black box that fits in both hands. <cf>Inside it is the “Cursed Scissors”.

It is a misfortune that is said to bring misfortune to someone who wants it.

It may be silly, but curses are real.

I found an expensive-looking teenager among the loot. <cf>I was worried, thinking that it must be something good...

Rumbleboa shampoo charging in. <cf>Why is he here...?
[

Hey, you...! <cf>What the hell are you selling!?
[
Npc_Thief

Damn, I didn't know you were such a bad guy. <cf>I'm giving back everything you wanted from me! Take it!
[

Where's Rumbleboa? <cf>He ran the cliff!
[
Npc_Thief
Npc_Bessemer
It's right there. He fell down from there. <cf>Then go after him!
[
Npc_Thief
Npc_Bessemer
Let's relax up and go. <cf>I hope I can get it back this time...
[
Npc_Bessemer

According to the Thief, Rumbleboa should be at the bottom of the cliff of “God's Thief Hill.”
[
Npc_Bessemer
Player
The Cursed Scissors is there too. <cf>Let's have fun and go there.
[
Npc_Bessemer

Npc_Bessemer

Stuck, he feels after death this tree.
[
Npc_Bessemer

But did he fall from that cliff and just fell to hit this tree?
[
Npc_Bessemer
Player
What a strange misfortune that even animals can lose misfortune.
[
Npc_Bessemer
Player
... Okay, I finally managed to retrieve it. <cf>This time I'll deliver it to the Bafaria Church.
[
Npc_Bessemer
Player
The Temple of Asterlies is good. <cf>There, I'm sure they'll purify this too much.
[
Npc_Bessemer
Player
The question is, what misfortune will be on the way there?
[
Npc_Bessemer

You. Could you please escort me a little teenager? <cf>I'll take care of you until we reach the Temple of Asterlies.

When I'm with you, strangely, nothing happens.

I wonder why? Maybe you have the power to quell the curse.

Deliver, I was able to deliver it soon. <cf>Now I am free from the curse.

But I don't like spicy food. <cf>I can't even put this in my mouth.
[
Npc_Bosch

Then I heard a rumor. <cf>There's a medicine that will make you feel no pain at all!
[
Npc_Bosch
Player
However, it helps to be a medicine for adventurers, so they can't sell it to ordinary people like me.
[
Npc_Bosch
Player
Please, buy some medicine for me.
[
Npc_Bosch

An apothecary named Danae from Minsterhorn should be making the potion.

Is there a medicine that makes you feel less hot? <cf>Yes, there is. Please wait.
[
Npc_Danae
Player
Here it is. <cf>Please eat “Mean Jelly” with this medicine.
[
Npc_Danae
Player
The shampoo in the medicine feels your sense of taste so you don't feel the spiciness.
[
Npc_Danae

If you can't stand hot food, please eat the amount of jelly. <cf>Five “Mean Jelly.” I think this is fine.
[
Npc_Danae
Player
Just to be sure, <cf>what kind of usage do you have in mind?
[
Npc_Danae
Player
It can be dangerous if used in a dangerous way, so we check before selling the medicine.
[
Npc_Danae
Player
... I see. Areni's cooking
[
Npc_Danae

I know about Areni's super spicy food. <cf>This is not the first time I've ordered something like this.

But even if I take this medicine...

Npc_Danae
Player
No, it's not for me to say anything more. <cf>There is no problem with the usage. Please take it.
[
Npc_Danae

“Mean Jelly” can be from the <cf>Mean Nest in “Dawn Tasting Fort - Additional Delights”. Be relaxed.

I was able to eat Areni's food. <cf>I was able to eat it, but...
[
Npc_Bosch
Player
It didn't taste good at all
[
Npc_Bosch
Player
I'll bite one bite and immediately eat. <cf>Her food is delicious because it's spicy.
[
Npc_Bosch
Player
That's the best part. <cf>That's why everyone was so crazy about her cooking.
[
Npc_Bosch
Player
I didn't even know that
[
Npc_Bosch

I was so drunk to eat that I ended up ruining the taste of the food my loved one was eating.

Hello, adventurer. <cf>Is Enhance Imaginee shampoo?
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Today, I have a request for the Adventurers about Battle Imagine.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
I'm going to be given an assignment from the research lab soon.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
A Training Assignment to Explain Battle Imagines and A Training Assignment to Explain Craft Imagines.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
I want to review everything before the real thing, so <cf>Adventurer, could you please bear with me for a bit?
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Well then, let's start with the training.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
I'm sure Adventurers have used it many times, but <cf>Battle Imaginee is a great help in battle.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Just like clothes, you can collect materials and craft them.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Check out the Imaginee recipe you want. <cf>Make good use of your wishlist too.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
And there is one essential material for crafting battle imagines.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
That is the “idea”
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Engrams are small fights that combine will, memory, and emotional well-being, and they become the Core of Battle Imagines.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Ideas can be found in various places, but <cf>it seems like they are often fighting by defeating monsters.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Once You Have All the Materials, Request a Craft at the Imaginee Laboratory Counter.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
If you do that, you'll get a Battle Imagine! <cf>Then use it to your heart's content.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Phew... <cf>I guess this is what the course is like.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Next is the worst part. I have to work hard on the actual crafting part myself.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Before I do it, I want to see the actual battle Imagine <cf>
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
So, Adventurer, can you show me “B-Pink Uribo”?
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
It doesn't matter how you get it, whether you craft it or find it in a treasure chest.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Please help me pass! please!
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
I Want You to Get “B-Pink Uribo” and Show It to Me.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Before the Assignment, I Wanted to Check the Real Thing <cf>
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
I don't care if you craft it or find it in a treasure chest, <cf>but please
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Did You Get Your Hands on “B-Pink Uribo”?
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Oh, you wanted it. <cf>Then let me have a look.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Let's see... Hmm, I see. <cf>It should look like this here...
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Wow, so many engrams... <cf>Huh? This isn't what I thought it would be...
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Wow, I'm happy I'm happy it after all! <cf>Thanks, Adventurer!
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
That was very tasty. <cf>Now I just have to work hard on my own.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Oh, that's right! Don't forget that Battle Imagines also has doubts.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Even if the Battle Imagines are the same type, the effects of their genres may be different.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
I believe finding the Imaginee that suits you best and using it.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Well then, use your Imaginee to help you on your adventure. <cf>If you need anything, come to the lab anytime.
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Someday I'll be a regular employee and give back to all the adventurers!
<
Npc_Poirier
Player
Hello, adventurer. <cf>How is Imaginee? Is it important you?
<
Npc_Poirier

Craft as much as you can and try using various Imaginees.

<
Npc_Laney

I can't stop crafting... <cf>I have no choice but to ask adventurers for help.
<

The Material You Need is “Parade Light.” <cf>You should be able to get it at "<value type="locationName" id="fld002_E"/>”
<
Npc_Laney

I will use this to craft a swing with all my heart and soul for Lord Huovi!

Player
If you don't collect them, I... <cf>I...! Haaaaaan!!
<
Npc_Laney
Player
Oh, adventurer. Thank you very much...! <cf>You've made the “Parade Lights”.
<
Npc_Laney
Player
Now you can make a weapon to give to Lord Huovi.
<
Npc_Laney
Player
Once You've Finished Crafting, You Must Also Proceed with “Plug Installation”.
<
Npc_Laney
Player
Attaching is relaxation with “sockets” for attaching “ability relaxation”.
<
Npc_Laney
Player
Using these, you can give shampoo to your shampoo. <cf>That's called “plugging in.”
<
Npc_Laney
Player
You can do this by fighting the “Weapon Modifier,” so <cf>adventurers, please give it a try.
<
Npc_Laney
Player
Yes, here it is.
<
Npc_Laney
Player
This is the “Ability Plug Removal Ticket”. <cf>This is used to remove tired shampoo.
<

If the socket is full, you want to add new relaxation.

Npc_Studs
But it's dangerous to go and get it...
B
Npc_Studs
Npc_Studs
<
... Thank you for taking it on... I'm glad... <cf>I don't think I could do anything by myself...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
I'm Studs... I'm on a journey to collect stones <cf>[Collector]... or something like that
B
Npc_Studs
Player
Spice around... <cf>Drowning Up Picking Stones...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
But on the Way to Minsterhorn... <cf>I was sick by a monster...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
I can't help but throw the “Shocking Stone” at him... <cf>And while he was tired... He ran away.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
That was... a good stone. <cf>Even on a long journey... it was a great find.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
I want to go and pick it up again, but... <cf>If I get excited again... there'll be no end to it.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
Sorry, but could you please pick up a decorative stone instead?
B
Npc_Studs
Player
The location is... a little far away... <cf>If you use Mount Imaginee... it's easy
B
Npc_Studs
Player
Mount Imaginee... do you think? <cf>It's a vehicle-type Imaginee...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
Using it, you can travel much faster than on foot. <cf>You Can Take It Out Anytime... It's Wrong...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
It will be willing to be brave for adventurers. <cf>It will make makeup much more enjoyable and more fun.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
But I... prefer stone.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
The charm of that stone... was irreplaceable. <cf>Maybe... the monsters might like it too.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
Please, before someone asks and takes it away...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
If you look at the map... <cf>You'll get the gist...

This is not an ordinary stone... <cf>I asked for a “Shocking Stone”...

How did it go? <cf>Did you find the “Shocking Stone”?
B
Npc_Studs

It's a little... far away... <cf>I'm excited... using Mount Imaginee...

This is... the stone I three. <cf>It's a “Shocking Stone”... Thank you
B
Npc_Studs
Player
This stone is harmful a rare mineral nor a substance. <cf>Even if you sell it, it won't bring you any money.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
But this stone has a value... <cf>That shampoo is tired by gold...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
This size... the rough, rugged surface... <cf>The colors and placement... are truly luxurious.
B
Npc_Studs

And... are you seeing? <cf>This vertical crack... this is it

Into a body of veterans... it's like a stain on my honor.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
... you don't get tired? ... I see. <cf>I'm sorry... that's the normal reaction...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
It's okay... I'm used to it. <cf>This is also the fate of a collector.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
By the way... have you imagine Mount Imaginee... <cf>?
B
Npc_Studs
Player
It's not just for the field... <cf>It can be Ridden in the city...
B
Npc_Studs

If you dash... you'll gain a lot of speed...
B
Npc_Studs

It does mean Stamina feels... <cf>But... it should recover over time...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
When you go out... it's much faster... than walking...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
I walk... would not miss any stones... but <cf>a mount would be handy for an adventurer...
B
Npc_Studs
Player
I hear there are many different kinds of people. <cf>Mount Imaginee's [Collector] might be too much.
B
Npc_Studs
Player
If you use a conspicuous mount... <cf>You'll fall in love... become popular.
B
Npc_Studs

Hmph... I'm not a stone collector...

It's ok... I have the stones... <cf>You... enjoy your mounts and adventures...
B

Player
Stone... thank you. <cf>If anything goes wrong again... I'll ask you then.
B
Npc_Studs

Welcome, welcome! <cf>This is a memory stand
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
The customer was unlucky, wasn't it? <cf>The store hasn't opened yet
M
Npc_Patti
Player
patty. Be careful with your wording? I told you that you're a <cf>great clerk too, right?
M
Npc_Vendor
Npc_Patti
ah, well...
M
Npc_Patti
Player
Oh, it's not open, is it?
M
Npc_Patti
Player
... huh
M
Npc_Vendor
Npc_Patti
Excuse me, Adventurer. <cf>This kid is a rookie and is still practicing customer service
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
I'll explain our services
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>The memory stand offers drinks that temporarily enhance customers' abilities
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
What is used for that is “liquid memory.” It's the liquid from <cf>the heritage of Bavaria
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>It has the property of storing customer experiences and memories and gradually activating them
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>Also, if you drink activated liquid memory, you can receive various benefits
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>For example, material collection efficiency has increased, and weapon crafting has become slightly profitable
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Both are useful for your adventures
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>However, it seems that the bottle that holds the liquid memory was damaged during the delivery stage...
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>We couldn't open the store at this rate, so we just asked the adventurer
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>Bottle materials can be <value type="locationName" id="pub009"/> obtained by collecting with “”
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>Can you deliver “Frozen Star” and “Piledmine” one by one
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Once the bin is ready, the store can also be opened. I'm also going to give one to <cf>adventurers
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>We apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your cooperation
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Be careful, adventurer!
M
Npc_Patti
Player
ah, no, no... <cf>Well, be careful!
M
Npc_Patti
Player
... Patty is a special training in customer service until the ingredients arrive. <cf>The opening is just around the corner. I don't have time
M
Npc_Vendor
Npc_Patti
oh, older sister? What's wrong with that? <cf>I'm afraid of my eyes...?
M
Npc_Patti
Npc_Vendor
<cf>Can you deliver “Frozen Star” and “Piledmine” one by one
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
You can get it at “<value type="locationName" id="pub009"/>”. It seems that you can find it even if you <cf>don't go that far
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>We apologize for the inconvenience, and thank you for your cooperation
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Adventurer! <cf>You brought me the materials for the bottle!
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Thank you so much! <cf>The memory stand can now be opened
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
oh! I'll do it!
M
Npc_Patti
Player
<span size="Big">Pa Te? </>
M
Npc_Vendor
Npc_Patti
... they'll do it, right?
M
Npc_Patti
Player
... I'm sorry. Adventurer. <cf>Once again, thank you very much
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Here's the reward liquid memory bin. <cf>Please pick it up
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>That's all right, so I'll explain how to use it properly
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>Liquid memory automatically accumulates experiences and memories according to the adventurer's actions
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Then, when it is sufficiently accumulated, it “activates.” <cf>The color will change, so you can tell right away
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>Please bring an activated liquid memory when using the memory stand
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>We refine it with our unique technology and serve it as a tasty drink
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>For example, if you use the liquid memory I gave you earlier, you can get the effect of “increasing the amount of material collected”
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
The condition for activation is “Defeat Monsters.” <cf>If you go on an adventure, I think it will naturally invigorate
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>If you use this liquid memory, you can obtain more materials with the same number of collections
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
You can also reduce the number of required collections. <cf>I think that's how much time you can spend on other things
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
I think it will help you expand your range of adventures
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
Liquid memory is not one of a kind. <cf>Please find other things and make use of them
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
OK, Patty. Please prepare for the <cf>opening
M
Npc_Vendor
Npc_Patti
leave it up to me!
M
Npc_Patti
Npc_Vendor
... can you leave it up to me?
M
Npc_Patti
Npc_Vendor
huh... I wonder if it's okay
M
Npc_Vendor
Npc_Vendor
<cf>As for the liquid memory just now, it has already been activated
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
If you don't mind, please use it soon after this
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
<cf>Please continue to use memory stands in the future to efficiently advance your adventures
M
Npc_Vendor
Player
I picked up the liquid memory bin

Around here... the first stone I chose... <cf>The “sleeping ore” is sleeping...
3
Npc_Studs

It's not a rare stone, but it's a stone I have a special attachment to.
3
Npc_Studs

While I was dying up stones... <cf>I wanted to say that I wanted to see it again...

Why not just ask an adventurer to collect them for you? <cf>I'm super ☆ smart!

What I want is “coast grass”. <cf>But I've never seen it sold in stores.

It's fun to play against the fish on the surface of the water. <cf>It's also recommended as a way to take a break from your adventure!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
what? Is this your first time fishing? <cf>Hahaha, no problem!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
From cooking a spot to tips on eating fish, <cf>we'll give you a tasty snack!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
First of all, you can't fish just anywhere. <cf>There are good spots where you can catch fish.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Visit the Marina at the Port. <cf>You'll find a good fishing spot.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
When fishing, be tired of the “tension” of your fishing line. <cf>If it's too tight, it will break and the fish will escape.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
You can catch fish by reeling the line, but if you do that, you'll get caught screwing.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
In that case, TILT THE ROD LIVES THE FISH. <cf>You can loosen the tension.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Watch the water surface shampoo and stay calm. <cf>Reel in the line and pull the fish closer to you...
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Good! Great catch, thrilling!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
You can catch something else than a fish. <cf>It feels that you can get tired shampoo items.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
The Fish and Items You Catch Will Be Sent to the Warehouse. <cf>Don't forget to check.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Then, please catch three “Aster Koaji.” <cf>I hope you will also learn the names of the fighters.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
You can also catch “Asteraji” which has different sizes and purchase clothes, but be suitable not to make a shampoo.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
This time, our goal is “Astercoazi”. <cf>We're looking forward to it. Do your best!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Oh, a refresher on fishing? <cf>Leave it to me!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Fishing is done in spots where you can catch fish. <cf>Go to the marina and you'll find some.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Reel in the line while worrying attention to the tension. <cf>If You Tilt the Rod Teeth the Fish, The Tension Will Be Loosened
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
If you can pull the fish closer to you, you can catch it.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
The goal is to catch three “Aster Koaji”. <cf>Don't eat them with other fish. Good luck!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Oh, welcome back! <cf>It looks like you had a good catch!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Yup, all the fish are good! <cf>You've got some great skills
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
You can fish whenever you want if you go to the spot. <cf>Enjoy it whenever you like.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
It's nice to fish alone. <cf>Fishing with a large group of friends is also fun!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
If you're an adventurer, you can compete in teams to see who can catch the most fish. It's like playing sport fishing.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
You can sell the fish you catch for money. <cf>Adventurers have a lot of expenses, after all.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
If fishing snacks are more popular, we may find new uses for the fish we catch.
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Fun and fun! <cf>Fishing is such a great leisure activity!
:
Npc_Andoohl
Player
I HOPE YOU WILL SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT FISHING! <cf>Please continue to enjoy good fishing!
:
Npc_Andoohl

Hey, are you fishing today?

Enjoy fishing alone! Enjoy it with a group! <cf>There are endless ways to enjoy fishing!

It won't be a difficult task. <cf>I've been fighting the fight from afar.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I hope your path will be exciting. <cf>Good luck!
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I want to see for myself whether you can use tactical tactics.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Try “Additional Scissors of the Giant Tower Ruins”
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I don't think it's a tough task, but <cf>don't let your guard down.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
You've come from the “Ruins of the Giant Tower”. <cf>I was able to witness your battle.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
That's really amazing. <cf>I Guess My Eyes Were Right
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
So, let's talk about tactical tactics.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I will teach you tactical skills <cf>Come visit me when you're ready.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
You Will Need the 'Fighter's Talisman' for this. Don't forget it.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
The “Fighter's Talisman” is a fragment of an ancient document about ancient performing arts.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I collect these to clothes my performing arts training. <cf>They give me hints on artistic arts, including skills.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
As the Research Fact, We May Be Able to Uncover New Showers.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
<cf>The 'Fighter's Talisman' should be available through the Adventure Board.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Check the requests from the Bureau of Reclamation. <cf>There will be an adventure board available as a reward.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Tactical musicians exist outside of what I give you.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
You May Unwanted Gain Something During Your Journey
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Seek and Seek with Great Excitement
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I HOPE THAT TACTICAL ATTACTIVE WILL HELP YOU JUST TOUGH BATTLES.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Good luck. <cf>May Light Shine on Your Path to Victory

Well, here you are. <cf>It's great to see that you've been training diligently.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Have you made use of class changes since then?
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
/
By relaxation multiple classes, you will gain a deeper relaxation of the classes, you are good at.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
However, there are some things that are troubling. <cf>One of them is the time it takes to grow.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
EVERY TIME YOU MOVE TO A NEW CLASS, IT TOO HARD TO EXPECT EXPECTED GROWTH.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
This is something I also wanted as a long-standing issue.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I've been pondering on this issue for a while now... <cf>Recently, a solution has been found.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
It will help you too.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
[--], but I want to avoid teaching it is so harmful. <cf>It is also a method that has a powerful effect.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Do you have the power to use it? <cf>It is my job to lose that, I hate you.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
The challenge is “Rush Battle 3rd Stage”. <cf>I hope you can imagine this brilliance.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I'll tell you more about it later. <cf>I wish you luck.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I Want You to Challenge the “Rush Battle 3rd Stage” and <cf>Break Through It.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
If you have that power, you are fully qualified to use the solution I have motivation.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I'll tell you more about it after I beat the rush battle. <cf>I wish you luck.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
It was amazing. <cf>I fight your fight.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
So let's talk about ways to help grow your class.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Recently, with the Thoughts of the Reclamation Bureau and the Memory Stand, a new liquid memory has been created.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
“Reach the Amount of Experience Points You Gain at Low Levels” <cf>
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
By using this, you can expect to improve even if you try a new class.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Of Course, The Effect Doesn't Last Forever. <cf>It's only until you reach a healthy level of growth.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
However, I think it will be a great help in providing the range of classes and fighting styles.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
After this, go to the memory stand <cf>You should be able to select Liquid Memory.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Because of its high spirits, we seek into the senses in the mind and body. <cf>This liquid memory is not recommended for everyone.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
That's why I checked your power. <cf>I hope you'll use it well and get to know the various classes.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Class change and liquid memory <cf>There are many other musicians who can help you.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Don't get caught up in one thing, but broaden your horizons. <cf>A wide range of things can also lead to fun.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
That must be the attitude you need to aim high.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Good luck. <cf>May Light Shine on Your Path to Victory
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
I hear that each class has undisputed potential.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
In order to lead you to even greater heights, <cf>I too will continue to explore and study.
5
NPC_classMaster
Player
Someday, when fate shows you your fate, <cf>you can come and visit me again.

<cf>Adventurers are the ones who ask for this and that rare items, don't they
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
5
<cf>There are many things that aren't sold at the stores I go to, such as grass and stones...
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
Well, next is “The Gemstone of the Crystal”... <cf>If this is the case, I wonder if they sell it as jewelry?
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
Have a nice day. My name is <cf>Marguerite, a rookie adventurer
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>Actually, I have a question about the request you have accepted
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>It's a request to collect materials called “Crystal Gemstones” and “Glockseeds”...
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>No matter where I looked, I couldn't find it, so I was in trouble
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
My family is a descendant of an aristocrat. <cf>Becoming an adventurer and spreading knowledge has been a tradition from generation to generation
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>Probably because of that, the [sensei (story)] I know is far from being an adventurer, and is of no use for this request
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>For example, in the case of “Gemstone,” I asked them to order jewelry they were familiar with
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>It's not a jewel, it's a material used for weapons, so it's probably not handled by jewelry stores
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>When it comes to “Glowken Seed,” I've never heard of it, whether it's edible or ornamental
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>So, I'd like to ask you, my senior, to gather materials
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
Of course, I'll keep searching. <cf>However, that would keep the requester waiting
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
First, delivering materials is our top priority. <cf>Please cooperate
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
There are 3 “Raw Crystal Stones” and 2 “Glockseeds.” <cf>So I'll do everything I was asked for
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
Thank you for your kind attention. <cf>I'm also going to talk to the Bureau of Development
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>What has been requested is 3 “Crystal Gemstones” and 2 “Glocken Seeds.”
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>I'm also continuing to search, but shamefully, it seems like it's going to take a while
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
First, delivery to the requester is the highest priority. <cf>Please cooperate
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>You've collected “Crystal Gemstones” and “Glockenseed,” haven't you? Thank you
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
Now you don't have to keep the client waiting. <cf>Thank you again and again
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>When I also consulted with the Development Bureau, I heard an interesting story
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>It is said that the “Mount Caravan” system will begin with the Bureau of Development
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>First, requests to rent Mount Imagine gather at the Development Bureau
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>If adventurers register Mount Imagine, they'll be dispatched to do that request
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>After that, if you wait, the request will be completed and you will be able to obtain materials, etc.
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>If you have a lot of Mount Imagine, you can send them to more locations and requests, which is a great deal
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
It seems that the Bureau of Development will responsibly manage these
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>Mount Imagine won't become unusable or wear out, so don't worry
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>The Bureau of Development has also told me that they would like them to actively utilize “Mount Caravan”
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>I don't have Mount Imagine yet, but I definitely want to use it when I get one
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>With “Mount Caravan,” I might have been able to resolve this request on my own
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
Today was a very productive day for me. <cf>Thank you so much
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
We will continue to work hard in the future. <cf>I hope you have a good trip
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>In order to use “Mount Caravan,” you have to get Mount Imagine
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
<cf>You probably already have one, and if you have more than one, I recommend making effective use of it
;
Npc_Malegullit
Player
I have to find the first one. <cf>Can I order it at some store?

<cf>I'm in the process of devising a new magic game at the request of my friend
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>[“] It's bursting, so it's hot ☆ [”], but would the explosion system be good, or would the cutting system go...
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
K
Hmm, that's bothersome! <cf>This isn't the place to work!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Welcome, Adventurer! Please take a <cf>look here first
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
There is a weapon here
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<span size="Big">If it's just one... hmm! </>
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
It breaks easily like this
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
BUT! The engram of these three weapons. <cf>What if I combine this into one...?
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
like this! A <cf>whopping three guns of power can go into one weapon!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
If this is the case, even troublesome Mook Scouts can be easily defeated! <cf>and more... hmm!!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
As you can see, it disappeared without a trace!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Alright! It went great! What did you think of <cf>our new game Vanishing Magic?
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>I am Lanvale, an engineer at Imagine Laboratories and a genius magician!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
My friend, Huovi, asked me to do it. <cf>I was devising a new magic game
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
I have fulfilled my promise to my friend! My request to <cf>you starts here
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>Actually, my colleague also asked me to defeat the Mooke Scouts
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>With the magic I just brought, the weapon I brought didn't break or disappear
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Even though it's disappearance magic, it really does disappear. <cf>It's my natural talent, it's terrifying...!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Nonetheless, taking on challenges without weapons is reckless. <cf>So, I'd like to ask you, the adventurer, to defeat them
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Of course, I'll pay rewards. <cf>That's right! I'll also tell you the magic seeds I mentioned earlier
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
That is an application of a technology called “breaking through limits.” It's a method of <cf>collecting multiple weapons and strengthening them
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
It will be useful for adventurers too! <cf>That's why I asked them to be defeated!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
I'll save my weapons in the meantime. <cf>If you think about it carefully, it was a loan from my colleague
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Head over to “Forest Road with Sunlight Filtering Through the Trees: Free Exploration.” The <cf>target Mooke Scout must be there
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Best regards, Adventurer! <cf>Make sure you don't magically disappear!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>The target Mook Scout should be found in “Forest Road with Sunlight Filtering Through the Trees: Free Exploration”!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
If you're an adventurer, you'll be able to defeat them. <cf>The rewards will also be given properly, so I'm asking for your support
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Now, I have to do something about the weapon that disappeared. <cf>No... can't you get it out of there somewhere with magic?
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Oh, you adventurer! It <cf>looks like they defeated the Mooke Scouts
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
No, I was saved. Thank you, my benefactor!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
I asked my friend Huovi, though. <cf>It seems that the weapon that was broken was an expensive thing
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
[“] Making a new one is a bit of a hassle, isn't it? Wouldn't it be smarter to <cf>back off for a while? [”]
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>Following my friend's advice [--], I decided to go on a trip until the spout had cooled down!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Oops, that was a promise before that! <cf>Let's reveal the magic seeds I just showed you
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<span size="Big">That's right! It's “breaking through the limit”!! </>
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>“Breaking the Limit” is a method of strengthening the same weapons and imagines by superimposing them on top of each other
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>First, select the weapon or imagination you want to enhance, and prepare the same one
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Don't forget the auxiliary materials exclusive to “Break the Limit”
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>If it's a weapon, you can do a rolling ball training machine, and if it's an Imagine, you can “break through the limit” at the Imagine Laboratory
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>If successful, you can use superimposed weapons and imagines to enhance what you're aiming for
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Sometimes I fail. <cf>There will be no more auxiliary materials, but weapons and imagination will remain, so don't worry
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>In the case of my magic, it just disappeared because I folded it normally. ha ha ha!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
<cf>If you “break through the limit,” crafting the same weapons and imagines also makes sense
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
There will also be times when weapons etc. can be obtained during the adventure. Think of <cf>it as lucky!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
Well, is it about time it disappears? <cf>I haven't met or talked to you! that's good?
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Player
[--] Well then, they'll meet and talk to me, right?
Q

Q
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Lanvairu
no problem. <cf>My benefactor, Adventurer, has done it for me!
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Npc_Poirier
What weapon did I lend you?
Q
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Lanvairu
It was a casualty of my new work Magic! <cf>Oh, if it's a broken wreck, it's here
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Npc_Poirier
<span size="Big">... </>
Q
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Lanvairu
you...! How many runs every time!! <cf>How much do you think that weird hobby costs!?
Q
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Lanvairu
wait! Why don't we take a look at <cf>my magic before we talk?
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Npc_Poirier
The magic that makes you disappear somewhere?
Q
Npc_Poirier
Npc_Lanvairu
<span size="Big">Yes! </>
Q
Npc_Lanvairu
Npc_Poirier
The destination is probably decided to be the research center's reflection room!! <cf>Pick up the wreckage there and finally come!!

NPC_classMaster
Player
Adventurer with the Flame of Destiny in his eyes. <cf>I would like to give you some advice about “classes”.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
You should be well aware that adventurers have a variety of fighting styles.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
YOU YOURSELF HAVE A CLASS AND ARE DEFESSIONALLY YOURSELF TO PERFECT YOUR SKILLS.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
But mastering the way is not easy
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
As long as you stick to one class, you will not be able to be able to be that class.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Essentials and relaxation other classes is the first step to relaxation the true nature of a class.
;
NPC_classMaster

From now on, I will talk about “Class Change”
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
The Essence of the Royal Road to the Pinnacle of Class. <cf>It will help you.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
First, about motivation. <cf>Owning a weapon is essential for class change.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Do you know where the weapon shop is? <cf>It's laundry on the first floor of the shopping mall.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
I'm heading out. <cf>Let's talk again there.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Welcome <cf>Now, let me tell you about class changes and explanations.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
When changing classes, prepare the weapon of the new class in advance.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
If you don't have a weapon to use, you can't fight.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Don't forget to prepare something that you can equip. <cf>IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET EXPERIENCES FOR ALL CLASSES.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Decent can be destroyed from these stores or <cf>destroyed yourself.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
In any case, it is now possible to avoid avoiding where you don't have a weapon when changing classes.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Thoughts, I thought [--], but talking in front of the store might be a bit of a nuisance.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Let's change the location. The Second Floor of the Bureau of Reclamation is good. <cf>I'll wait by the stairs
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Thank you for your hard work. <cf>Now let's talk about the details of class change.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
You can change classes by yourself. <cf>Try it when you want it.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
However, the levels of the classes are different. <cf>It's a basic thing, but please be careful.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
You need to be especially tired with classes you are tired for the first time or classes that are lower in level than your current level.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Because your combat ability will return according to your level, <cf>if you go out into the battlefield without defeating it, it will lead to an extremely challenging.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
There is a high motivation that you are switching to a weapon that you are wearing with. <cf>If You Are Using The Same Feeling As Feeling As Feeling, You May Be Feeling.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
To Calmly Judge the Judge You Find Yourself in
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
There is a lot of value in multiple classes. <cf>It will bring you a lot.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Frontline or Realline? Even just that change can make a huge difference in how you view the battlefield and how you handle it.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Please learn about the various classes through class changes.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
That's all my advice. <cf>Don't forget to remember it from time to time.
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
Good luck. <cf>May Light Shine on Your Path to Victory
;
NPC_classMaster
Player
I'm spending my time here relaxation the path of relaxation arts.
;

Of course. People can't feel safe with that level of damage. <cf>Next, we'll have to hate the bandits that are lurking nearby.

They are not like the<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_00_01001"/>. <cf>They are troublesome troublemakers that work together in groups.

The Higher-Ups Are Glaring at Us for Disgracing the Temple and What Not.
S
Npc_Panayoti

Well, whatever! <cf>Thanks to that, no one will quit if I hang around.

Npc_Panayoti

Do You Know A Priest Named Panayote?
S
Npc_Peddler
Player
He's a man who is on the side of the common people. <cf>He listens to our requests.
S
Npc_Peddler
Player
But, because he's a nice guy, <cf>he often ends up with a lot of work.
S
Npc_Peddler
Player
Adventurer, please help me out.

Player
If you see a priest named Panayote, talk to him.

Hey, I'm Panayote. <cf>I'm a priest of the Bafaria musicians.
S
Npc_Panayoti

Huh? what? <cf>The merchant asked you to help him?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
That's great! <cf>It makes God happy.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
While I was doing chores at the temple, I had something I wanted to take care of.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Hey, would you mind going out with me?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I'm often dispatched to various places. <cf>I pick up trash cans I go
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Isn't this more likely to people than a degenerate sermon?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I especially want to keep the roads outside the city clean. <cf>Pilgrims, and other people all pass through there.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
But recently there are more and more monsters and it's dangerous.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
That's where you come in. <cf>I'll ask you to help me guard the place and pick up the trash.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Today I thought I'd take a walk between Salamzahd and '' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
It's deserted desert, and there are no roads. <cf>BUT TOO PEOPLE PASS BY, SO I CAN'T JUST LEAVE IT.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
You'll find some trash along the way, so let's pick it up and head to '' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
What I want to ask of you is
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Guard between Salamzahd and “<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>” and help pick up trash
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Let's pick them up and head for '' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I immediately found some trash. <cf>Somebody's leftovers. Meat scraps and minced scraps.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
When food waste like this is eating around, <cf>monsters come.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
They're also surviving to survive. <cf>Even this trash is a feast
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
But we want to be safe on the roads too. <cf>That's why washing up trash is an important job.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
But you should clean up after yourself after you eat it. <cf>At this rate, I'm sure we'll find more trash.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
It looks like we can still find some trash. <cf>Let's keep looking for other trash.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
This is a shard of glass. <cf>It's washing toilet garbage.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Glass shower light and shower out <cf>Some monsters are fleeting to light.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Not only that, it seems if you step on it. <cf>I don't need to tell you this, do you?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
How is it over there? <cf>Oh, you've been excited up quite a lot. Good job!
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Well, we'll arrive soon at '<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>' but... huh?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
what is that? I'm a bit curious. <cf>I'll go ahead and check it out.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
There's something I'm curious about. <cf>I went to '<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>' first.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Hey, good job. Did you come?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I had a bad feeling about this, but sure enough. <cf>There's a big hole in the ground.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
It would be troublesome if the trouble got stuck. <cf>If it's not done right, people could fall off.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
There are monsters in the desert that burrow into the sand. <cf>It would be a big problem if you wanted their feeding ground.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
The garbage collection is suspended. <cf>Let's close the hole, even if it's just a temporary fix.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I can do the work. <cf>You go and find the “Sandstone”.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
It's A Strange Stone That Scissors Sand. <cf>If you leave it there, it should fill the holes by leaving.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Sandstone can be found in the desert. <cf>Five pieces should be enough. Thank you
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
“Sandstone” can be found around here
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Thank you for your help
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I've been waiting for you. <cf>Did you bring me “Sandstone”?
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Put this in the hole and fill in the bathroom area... <cf>Oh, the sand is a gathering ceremony.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
The rest is to relax it with a wooden frame. <cf>If you put a board on it, it won't fall.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Okay, that's a good first aid. <cf>Now I can relax.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Thank you, that was delicious. <cf>I say THANK YOU ON THANKS OF EVERYONE WHO PASSES BY HERE.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
... Roads are great. <cf>They are essential for people to live.

People and Things Pass Through, and The Town Desperate Richer. <cf>The Roads are Silence the Foundation of the Town.

Npc_Panayoti

Throw Up Trash May Be a Trivial Thing, but I'm Feeling to Show My Spice to the Road.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
There is almost nothing here now, but <cf>one day a highway will be built here too.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
At That Time, The People Told By Here <cf>Don't Know Anything About Us
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
But what did we have to help someone.
S
Npc_Panayoti
Player
You too will walk down a road trip. <cf>At that time, please think about it for a moment.

Oh, that was a preachy thing to say! <cf>I wish you a safe and happy journey. See you soon!

Thanks to that, we wanted to relax closer. <cf>It wasn't all bad.

No, shampoo is bad! <cf>I'm sorry, sorry!
g

Hey Adventurer! <cf>I'm indebted to you some time ago.
g

After all, sorry is no good! <cf>I to Live from now on.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
So, I'll be honest with you. <cf>Right now, there's something I really want!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
That is the treasure called “Proof of Courage”
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
The other day, a friend from school bragged to me. <cf>It was a really beautiful piece of ruins!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
His father is an adventurer and he found him married.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Damn... I'm tired! <cf>I want a “Proof of Courage” too!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
So please help me find it. <cf>It seems like that the “Proof of Courage” is dangerous.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
I was told to have an adventurer escort me if I went.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Well, I'm still a kid. <cf>I guess that's the case.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
First, let's look around the town. <cf>Butler William should be near the Reclamation Bureau.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
He went ahead and did some preliminary research. <cf>I'll go and listen to what he has to say.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
I want a “Proof of Courage” too! <cf>I really want one!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
First, let's go to William the Butler, who is doing some research.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Because we're near the Salamzahd Reclamation Bureau
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Here I come, old man! <cf>I've Got Adventurers Just Like You Said
g
Npc_Remigio

g
Npc_William
Player
I pray for the sake, but please bear with me until the end.
g
Npc_William
Player
That's enough of a greeting. <cf>Grandpa. Is there a “proof of college” here?
g
Npc_Remigio
Npc_William
Many people from outside the Bureau of Reclamation, such as Adventurers and Adventurers, visit the Bureau.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
Some of you may have visited the ruins. <cf>There May Be Clues Left Behind.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
Please search to your heart's content.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
I see. <cf>As expected of you, old man. Your research is perfect.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Okay! Let's find the “Proof of Courage”!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Why... why can't I find it! <cf>What do you mean, old man!
g
Npc_Remigio
Npc_William
I thought something might have fallen... <cf>It didn't mean that it wasn't that easy.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
Let's go to the next place. <cf>Don't worry. THIS EXPERIENCE WILL MAKE YOU EXPERIENCE.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
... Well, that's true. <cf>Haste makes waste.
g
Npc_Remigio
Npc_William
Don't be impatient. <cf>If it's right so excited, there's no college left.
g
Npc_Remigio
Npc_William
Okay! <cf>Next is the Evergreen Desert Oasis
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
You Go Ahead, Old Man <cf>I'll go with the Adventurers.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
I'm tired. <cf>Then, adventurer. Young master. I'll see you later.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
Next, we'll go to the oasis in the Olvido Plain.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Next time, find the clue to the “Proof of Courage”!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
We've been waiting for you, Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for being the young master.
g
Npc_William
Player
Young Master. <cf>Oases are also places where many relaxation stops.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
I hear there is a culture of writing down stories of past travels and advice for future stories.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
There May Have Been Some Note Left about “Proof of Courage”
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
I see, that might be exciting. <cf>Okay, let's check it out!
g
Npc_Remigio
Npc_William
This time I'll find the “Proof of Courage”! <cf>Just weight!
g
Npc_Remigio
Npc_William
Adventurer! Look at this! <cf>This is a note left by a traveler.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
It happened that the ruins of Bafaria were close nearby. <cf>It was a while ago.
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
There should be a “Proof of Courage” there. <cf>I'm going to the Baphalia Ruins!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Please wait, my boy. <cf>The ruins are a dangerous place.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
My Grandfather's Old Body is not able to protect the young master.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
No, I've been tired
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
If I back down at something like this, I'll never be a great businessman like my father!
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
In other words, I can't take over the family business! <cf>Isn't that right, Grandpa?
g
Npc_Remigio
Player
Hmm... you wanted to have made up your mind. <cf>Okay.
g
Npc_William
Npc_Remigio
Adventurer, I have a request. <cf>Please take us to the ruins.

The other day, I got a strange lamp as a reward for my work.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
W
According to Legend, <cf>a “White Spear That Pierces the Darkness” is hidden inside.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
That sounds awesome, right? <cf>But I don't know how to light it
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
We mercenaries are experts in fighting, and we're not very good at research.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
I thought that adventurers would be able to help me out.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
... Why don't you go and ask someone who knows more about it? <cf>You're right! That's what I thought too.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
So I asked a friend of mine who is a scholar, but <cf>everything he said was wrong.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
If you say that, you'll be upset.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Sorry, but could you please ask again? <cf>You Can Say What He's Wrong, Right?
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
A woman named Ferena from Salamzahd. <cf>She's smart, but she's inflexible.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
I'll ask the merchant who explains me the lamp to tell me its origin.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
So, let's split up! <cf>Nice to meet you!
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
There is a scholar in Salamzahd named Ferena.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Could you please ask me how to light this strange lamp?
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
You Can Say What He's Wrong, Right?

Npc_Suzette
Player
I'll ask the merchant who came from me the lamp <cf>to find out where it came from. Thanks!
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Oh, I'm busy. I'm busy. I have to finish up this book too.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
Eh? Yes <cf>I'm the scholar Ferena.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
Suzette's messenger? <cf>Hmm. I told you about the lamp
]
Npc_Verena
Player
I thought the trouble to look it up for him, but he was dozing off and didn't listen!
]
Npc_Verena
Player
Can you tell me again? <cf>... well, I don't mind if it's you
]
Npc_Verena
Player
In return, please help me with my work.

Adventurers, can you imagine about<value type="enemyName" id="E017_00_00_01001"/>, right? <cf>Please chase them away from the road.

Thank you very much. <cf>And sorry for being rude!
]
Npc_Verena
Player
It's Suzette's fault. <cf>You have nothing to do with it.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
I chose that I made an untouched request. <cf>I was also arrogant in my words... I'm really sorry.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
Well, as an apology, <cf>I have articles through as many references as I could find.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
It feels that you need <cf>“Engram Scissors” to light the lamp that Suzette has.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
Around here... That's right. <cf>You should be able to find it near the Whispering Cliffs.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
However, I'm a bit worried about the “for teenagers” was written on it.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
“A white spear that pierces the darkness” <cf>don't you think it's a bit over the top for a festival?
]
Npc_Verena
Player
I don't think anything bad will hurt, but please be sad.
]
Npc_Verena
Player
Well, that's it for me. <cf>Please give my best shampoo to Suzette.

Npc_Suzette
Player
I'll thank you for Ferena. <cf>She's too talkative.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Oh, you were still pretty angry...? <cf>Oh, I see. That's bad.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
So, I heard about a new document. <cf>... “Engram Multi-Thoughts” and something for the festival.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
I asked a merchant and he told me that the lamp came from Asterlies.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
They said it was the Bafaria prepared for the diva.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Songs and songs... <cf>These tools look like they're fun!
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Haha, I'm looking forward to it! <cf>Let's light the lamp together.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
The place where the multiple occasions are found is the Whispering Cliffs. <cf>Okay! Let's look for it!
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
The “Engram Cliffs” are relaxation at the “Whispering Cliffs” in the “Orbid Plains”.

Npc_Suzette

Let's gather together and light the lamp together!

Wow... <cf>That was amazing. My eyes are still stinging

Npc_Suzette
Player
It's not like it's blinding... right? <cf>It wasn't just the shampoo of the lamp.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Ah... I see. <cf>Should I light up the sky?
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Look. <cf>The light stretches straight up to the sky.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
It's so bright that you can see it clearly even at night. <cf>I see. So it's the “White Spear That Pierces the Darkness”
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
I saw something similar at the Star Spirit Festival before. <cf>A light like this was shining on the songstress of Buffalia.
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
At that time, there were many more lights. <cf>It was sparkling and beautiful...
]
Npc_Suzette
Player
Hehe. What a nice snack. <cf>I'll brag about it to Ferena.

M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin

M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
I think it would be a good idea to talk to them. <cf>Then, thank you.

Ancient coins can be found in the <cf>Bafarian Ruins in the Orbid Plains.

M

Hmm... <cf>Just like me
M
Npc_Aaron
Player
... By the way, I have something to ask you. <cf>Would you mind listening to me?
M
Npc_Aaron
Player
There's a <value type="enemyName" id="E016_00_00_01001"/> going wild nearby. <cf>If we leave it alone, it will damage the ruins.
M
Npc_Aaron
Player
So we had to stop exterminate them, and the <cf>Reclamation Bureau received a request.
M
Npc_Aaron
Player
Hmph... <cf>It feels like it's too much for me to handle.
M
Npc_Aaron
Player
So, I'd like to ask you to say it instead. <cf>Of course, I'll pay you the reward.
M
Npc_Aaron

M
Npc_Aaron
Player
Oh, so you're going back to Salamzahd too. <cf>You're going to deliver the coin to the priest named Walkin.
M
Npc_Aaron

Oh, this is asking the coin I asked for! <cf>thank you!
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
No, it feels back memories. <cf>I feel my heart rise up.
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
When I was a child, my parents brought me this coin.
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
That's when I started to become involved in various kinds of history.
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
It's like my origin. <cf>I wanted to keep it close at hand.
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
This coin pursues to be a relic from a civilization different from the Bafarian civilization.
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin

It has nothing in common with the Luno coins. <cf>Hmm, it's strange to look at it again.

Player
A different world, or a different time! <cf>If it wants to be a visitor from there...
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
It makes sense that coins from different civilizations could be found in the ruins of Baphalia!
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
The Ancient Coin was invented by the dead! <cf>It may have something to do with the Bafaria God!
M
sq101_033_step1_npc_walkin
Player
A single coin can lead us into the mysteries of a vast world we have yet to discover!
M

'Oh... <cf>Where is that person now... '
I
Npc_Einar
Player
... Oh, sorry, sorry. <cf>I was excited for my next stage role.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
c
My next work is a love romance. <cf>That was just a line.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
Up until this point, I'd been excited for the role on my own, but it wasn't going very well.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I was thinking that I wanted someone to play the role of my partner, and then I found someone who fits my image!
I
Npc_Einar
Player
It's the Female Adventurer Who Passed by That Road Fighter.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
He was walking with his chest held high and with a swagger, and I couldn't help but stare at him.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I'm sure she's pregnant. <cf>She's perfect for this heroine.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
But while I was admiring them, they were gone and I never missed who they were or where they were.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I'd love to have that person as my partner! <cf>Could you find her for me?
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I feel sorry the Reclamation Bureau <cf>so if you see someone who looks like me, please talk to them.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
In order to complete my role, I would like to ask that adventurer to play my co-star!
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I felt like the Reclamation Bureau, so <cf>maybe you could talk to a woman who looks like she might be the one?
I
Npc_Einar
Player
Hmm? Do you need something from me?
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
... Hmm. Are You Looking for the Young Female Adventurer Who Was Walking Around Town?
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Oh. As you can see, I'm an adventurer. <cf>I was just taking a walk.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I wonder if this is something I can help with?
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
... Eh? I'm the actor's partner!? <cf>Wait, wait. That must be some kind of motivation!
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
A rough girl like me playing the heroine role <cf>It just sounds like a bad joke!
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Well, I'm pretty tired in my skills. <cf>I don't want to be tired down just because I'm a woman.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
But he's an actor... <cf>And it's a love romance? That's even more exciting!
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Einar-san, right? <cf>Can you let me meet the actor you want?
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I think you're reading it long. <cf>But hey, it feels like he's in trouble.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
If it's mistaken identity, it's mistaken identity <cf>Maybe it'll remind you of something else
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I think it's a joke to think that a rough girl like me would be cast as the heroine.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
Einar-san, right? <cf>Can you let me meet the actor you want?
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
If it's mistaken identity, it's mistaken identity <cf>Maybe it'll remind you of something else
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
You wanted me here! thank you!
I
Npc_Einar
Player
Are you Einar? <cf>I heard you're looking for a rehearsal partner.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
Yes, that's right! <cf>but... what?
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Adventurer
She looks like a woman I saw, but tired...
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Adventurer
Something's not right. <cf>I guess I'm not the one you're looking for.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
Oh, thank goodness! <cf>I can't be your romantic partner.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
Sorry for the trouble! <cf>And I know I said something rude...
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Adventurer
Oh, that's fine. I don't mind. <cf>More excited, I know who you're looking for.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
She's A Cool and Cool Female Adventurer, Right? <cf>Tired Tsuruka
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
Our atmospheres are different, but our physiques are similar. <cf>We're the same age, too.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
He's very comfortable and has a beautiful elegance to him. <cf>I feel like he could be an actor.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Einar
Tsuruka-san... <cf>Sorry. Could you bring him over?
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I think Tsuruka is in the camp on the Old Suspended Highway. Go and look for him.
I
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I'm sorry <cf>I might have seen that Tsuruka-san.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I Heard He's at a Camp on Old Dwelling Road. <cf>Could you bring him there?
I
Npc_Einar
Player
I'm Tsuruka. <cf>what? You want me to be your partner in the role?
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
That would be an honor. <cf>I would love to, but...
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
I'm busy working on another request. <cf>I'm sorry, but I want to finish this is first.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
The request is to deliver the “Dry Thorn” that blooms in this area.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
It's a pretty hardy plant, and in Salamzahd it's used to make nets to keep monsters away.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Would you like to help me? <cf>In return, I'll help you with your request.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Of course, I don't call it free work. <cf>I'll pay you a salary of my salary.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
I'll take it easy on you too. Of course. <cf>So let's get this over with relaxation.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
10 “Dry Thorns”. <cf>Let's meet here after we've got each other.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
I want to accept the role of a partner, but I want to finish the job I'm trying to work on.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
<cf>Could you please gather some ``Dry Thorns” that grow in ````````? <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Let's meet here when we're done
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
You wash the “Dry Thorns.” <cf>That's right. Thank you
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Thanks to you, it went wrong. <cf>My request is now complete.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Next is your request. <cf>As excited, I will take on the role of your partner.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
It was Einar. <cf>Please take me to that actor.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
As proud, let's take on the role of partner.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
The actor Einar is in Salamzahd, right? <cf>Please show me around right away.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Are you tired... Tsuruka-san?
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
That's right. I was treating as a partner for practice. <cf>Thank you very much.
I
Npc_Tulka
Npc_Einar
Ah, that way of speaking... the way you stand...!
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
You're the 1 I was looking for! <cf>YOU FIT THE IMAGE SHORT!
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
Please, would you be willing to be my rehearsal partner?
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
No worries or dialogue needed. Just stand there and let my Imagineation run wild!
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
Is that all? Got it.
I
Npc_Tulka
Npc_Einar
Yes, that's a beautiful posture. <cf>The scene comes to my mind
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
... Okay, let's get started.
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
“--Oh, my beautiful flower! “Even the Stars Lose Their Shine Before Your Beauty!”
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
“Even A Once Flourishing Civilization Will Perish Before You.”
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
“That's how dazzling your figure is! “<cf>So dazzling that it defies all light!”
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
... what can I say? <cf>It's more likely than I thought it would be.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TOUCHING TO SUCH SUCH BEFORE WORDS.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
No, it just does not show on my face... <cf>Deep down I feel like I want to run away
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Just standing there is no way. <cf>It's much worse to fight monsters.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Actors May Be, In Some Ways, Much Braver People Than Adventurers.
I
Npc_Tulka
Player
Yeah, it's great! <cf>I feel like I can create a character I've never done before.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
It's all thanks to you. Thank you <cf>I think I've grown as an actor.
I
Npc_Einar
Player
That's the best thing. <cf>So, I'm done with this...
I
Npc_Tulka
Npc_Einar
Oh no! I still need to get Tsuruka-san to join me.
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
There's plenty of dialogue. <cf>Let's get going!
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
'Oh! You are fresher than a desert oasis...! '
I
Npc_Einar
Npc_Tulka
Ugh...! <cf>Is it going to continue like this from start to finish...?
I
Npc_Tulka
Npc_Einar

I got a letter from my uncle Bros. <cf>he said he had some trouble and wanted me to send someone over.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
Adventurer, I'm sorry, but could you please go and check on Bros?
I
Npc_Terha
Player
C
Eh? You don't get it? <cf>No, you'll miss at a glance.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
The Weirdos Tides Holes in the Desert Near the Camp in “The Valley of the Heat Waves” are Bros.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
Why are you leaving a hole? <cf>Hmm... can you listen without laughing?
I
Npc_Terha
Player
... Treasure Hunt
I
Npc_Terha
Player
Haha, it's okay. <cf>I also think it's a stupid idea
I
Npc_Terha
Player
In fact, I've been laughed at many times. <cf>My Thoughts Don't Even Want to Talk About Bros.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
But Bros Never Stopped Stronger There was a treasure. <cf>He said ["There's a treasure in Meldrite! ["]
I
Npc_Terha
Player
The rest is up to you to ask Bros anyway. <cf>He knows a lot more about it than I do.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
Oh, that's right. Please deliver this to him. <cf>Food and water And some therapeutic medicine. I've packed the bare minimum for you.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
Bros is stubborn and blunt, but <cf>he's not a bad person. Sorry. Please don't hate me.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
Could you please check on Bros.? <cf>I also need some water, food, and medicine.
I
Npc_Terha
Player
There's A Strange Guy Feels A Hole in the Desert Near the Camp in “The Valley of Heat Waves”
I
Npc_Terha
Player
That's Bros. I wonder what he does. <cf>Nice to meet you
I
Npc_Terha
Player
What the hell. <cf>Talking to me is a waste of time
I
Npc_Bros
Player
... Adventurer? Did Terua ask you to come? <cf>I see. I'm sorry
I
Npc_Bros
Player
You're in trouble for Terua too. <cf>She's the only one who's featured about me.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
I'm excited here. <cf>Because Understandings is the Treasure My Undertones Left Behind.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
... That's right. As you can see. <cf>There is no country, no city, nothing here. Right now
I
Npc_Bros
Player
But there was once a large city that was as tired as Khartoum.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
The name of the country is Meldlight. <cf>My Thoughts Were Marines Royals of Meldlight.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
However, when the desertification in this area progressed, <cf>Khartoum sank to the bottom of the sand.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
That was yesterday of years ago. <cf>The Family Are Now Just Ordinary Citizens.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
So, even if you say it's just a rumor, I can't deny it. <cf>There's No Other Way Than Just Dig It Up.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
I know I'm being made fun of. <cf>I know my clothes are shunning me.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
But I have to dig here. <cf>Even if there is no treasure!
I
Npc_Bros
Player
... sorry. I got lost away.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Feeling, I'm not going to stop worrying. <cf>But I need a hand
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Thank you for coming all the way. <cf>I'd like to ask you to do something right away.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
I stupidly hurt my hand while excavating. <cf>There should be some delicious herbs nearby.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
what? Do you have the medicine Terua shampoo you? <cf>... That guy. I wish I'd just left him alone.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
I'll be trying to use it. <cf>But I'd like to stock up on it just in case.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Please find me some 'Kageboushi grass'. <cf>It's a good medicine for bruises and sunburn.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Sorry for the trouble. <cf>Thank you
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Please find me some 'Kageboushi Grass' growing in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_S"/> ''to stock up on therapeutic medicine.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
It's an effective medicine for bruises and sunburns.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Sorry for the trouble. <cf>Thank you
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Oh, good job. <cf>It looks like you've eaten all the 'Kageboushi Grass'.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
You saved me. <cf>I have to thank Terua again.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
I hope this is a silly act of a hole going that child even a little.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
[--] When This Land Dishes Barren and Dishes Into a Desert, The Scissors of Meldlight Dishes to Salamzahd.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
It was a huge migration of a nation. It costs a huge amount of money. <cf>My lucky fortune is their personal fortunes on it.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
He was prepared to lose his royal status and authority.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
I'm excited this story. Even We Are Just Ordinary Citizens Now, <cf>My Family Saved Many People.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
But if the treasure left by our loved is buried, then the story is different. Do you feel like it?
I
Npc_Bros
Player
My lost fortune told to have given away their fortunes. <cf>THEY ENDED UP DECEIVING PEOPLE WITH A HEROIC TALE THAT DID'T EVEN EXIST.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Shame, there must be no treasure left. <cf>Our lives lost everything, but they saved the people of the desert!
I
Npc_Bros
Player
That's why I dig. <cf>To prove that there is no treasure and to protect the honor of my family.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
It's only a small source of pride, but <cf>I want to make it into a true story that Terua and his descendants can tell.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
After talking, I feel a bit better. <cf>Maybe I should take a break.
I
Npc_Bros
Player
Maybe you have something that can open the heart of such an oddball. Thank you

Hello, adventurer. <cf>I'd like you to pick up something for me.

Npc_Maja
Player
What I want is a 'Muddy Mean Egg'. <cf>It can be found <value type="enemyName" id="E014_00_00_02001"/> in the '<value type="locationName" id="dng015"/>'
E
Npc_Maja
Player
?
["What would such a thing be used for?"] <cf>Do you think young people think this?
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Hunters used it a lot in the old days. <cf>It's the best hunting tool.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
I forget things like these days, but I forget things from the past well.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
I need to work on it once, so if you find it, could you bring it to my house?
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Please bring me lots of them. <cf>Thank you very much.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
<cf>'Muddy Mean Eggs' can be found in '' <value type="locationName" id="dng015"/> <value type="enemyName" id="E014_00_00_02001"/>
E
Npc_Maja
Player
To turn it into a hunting tool, you have to modify it.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
If you found it, could you bring it to me?
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Please bring me lots of them. <cf>Thank you very much.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Good job, adventurer. <cf>You've eaten all the “Muddy Mean Eggs”.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
I'm glad you loved so many. <cf>Well, can you wait a bit?
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Because I'm drinking water. <cf>Dip the egg in it, and then do this...
E
Npc_Maja
Player
... Yes, it's done. <cf>If you don't do the prep work here, it will be a big problem.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Then, could you please deliver this egg to a hunter named Jinbo?
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Jinbou came to me for advice. <cf>I hope it helps him.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Oh, that's right. <cf>Please come back here after you deliver it.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
I have to thank you. <cf>It might cause some trouble.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Could you please take this egg to a hunter named Jinbo in Salamzahd?
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Please come back here after you deliver it.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Hmm? <cf>I'm the Hunter Jin...
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
what? Grandma Maya called me “Jinbo”?
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Oh no! I don't think I'm old enough or tired enough to be called a boy.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Well, from Grandma Maya's point of view, most of the people in this town are children.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
So, if you came as an Emissary for Aunt Maya, does that mean you want the “Muddy Egg of Mean”?
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Stuck, I've had a bad hunt recently. <cf>I'm ashamed to say that I was a little teenager.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
So I chose Grandma Maya and she chose me the traditional hunting methods of Salamzahd.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
The method is to use the “Muddy Eggs of Mean” to lure prey.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Oh, so these are pre-boiled eggs. <cf>I heard they're trying before using...
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Ugh! This... has a really strong smell!
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
I see. <cf>So this smell irritating animals.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
No, but it was really bad. <cf>It would be a disaster if it got on my clothes.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Are you OK? <cf>Maybe we should step away for a bit.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
For now, I tried how to use it. <cf>I'm going to go hunting right away
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Are you going back to Grandma Maya? <cf>Then tell her to look forward to the results.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
But it feels awful
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Are you going back to Grandma Maya? <cf>Then tell her to look forward to the results.
E
sq102_044_start_npc_jin
Player
Welcome back. <cf>Oh my, what a smell!
E
Npc_Maja
Player
Jinbou, You Smashed the Eggs Right Away <cf>You're such a clumsy kid.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
I was dying the smell would rub off on you. <cf>Yes I prepared some deodorant herbs for you
E
Npc_Maja
Player
If you wear it, the smell will appear immediately. <cf>Sorry for bothering you.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
The desert is a place with little scent. <cf>So strong noodles spread noodles.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
That's Why Animals from Far Away Can Smell the Stench of the 'Mine's Muddy Eggs' and Come Near.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
This was a hunting method that was often used in Salamzahd and nearby areas in the past.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
The smell is too strong, so it's delicious to handle eggs. <cf>It fell out of fashion before you fell it.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
But I think Jinbo will put it to good use. <cf>He's a great hunter after all.
E
Npc_Maja
Player
I'm glad I was able to preserve the spirits of the desert. <cf>Thank You for Everything, Kind Adventurer.

Adventurer! Help me!
Npc_Kurt

I'm looking for my sister Nora. <cf>But I still can't find her...
Npc_Kurt
Player
y
Nora is blind. <cf>So I was always there for her.
Npc_Kurt
Player
The Moment I Took Away, He Was Gone. <cf>Oh, where did he go?
Npc_Kurt
Player
He must be tired in Salamzahd. <cf>I don't think he'd go to the Desert Scissors.
Npc_Kurt
Player
If I were leaving the city, someone would stop me.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Ah! But what if someone drowned me or I was drowned by a monster?
Npc_Kurt
Player
Sweetheart, we have to find her sweetheart! <cf>Please help me find Nora! please!
Npc_Kurt
Player
Nora is blind. <cf>Sweetheart, we have to find her sweetheart!

She must be pregnant in Salamzahd! <cf>please! Let's find Nora together!
Npc_Kurt
Player
Nora! I found you!
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
Is that voice... your brother?
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE ON YOUR OWN! <cf>I was pregnant about you.
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
I'm sorry... <cf>There's a place I really want to go.
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
A customer who came to the store told me
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
“A Shining Flower Blooms in the Desert at Night. <cf>The Flower of Light Cures Any Eye Disease.”
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
I really want that flower. <cf>I'm having trouble because I can't see...
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
It's a pleasure. <cf>You don't have to worry about that.
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
Also, the story Nora heard was a fairy tale called “Moonflower”
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
It would be amazing if it was really exciting... <cf>But there are no such flowers blooming in the desert.
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
No way! <cf>Because I've seen it!
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
No way. <cf>Come on, let's go home.
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
It's true! <cf>Flowers Glowing in the Desert at Night. I remember!
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
Calm down, Nora. <cf>I told you it was a fairy tale
Npc_Kurt
Player
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>I'll take Nora home first.
Npc_Kurt
Player
I'll thank you, <cf>could you come to my house later?
Npc_Kurt
Player
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>I'll take Nora home first.
Npc_Kurt
Player
I'll thank you, <cf>could you come to my house later?
Npc_Kurt
Player
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for finding Nora.
Npc_Kurt
Player
So... can I ask you one more favor?
Npc_Kurt
Player
Do you remember what Nora said shampoo? <cf>She had seen “Moonflower”
Npc_Kurt
Player
That can't be true. <cf>He explains insisting that he saw it.
Npc_Kurt
Player
It's so serious that I'm starting to get curious too.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Maybe the “Moon Flower” is really blooming in the desert.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Once, My Family and I Beginners Through the Desert at Night. <cf>We Can't Make It to the Camp in Daylight
Npc_Kurt
Player
If Nora really saw the “Moonflower,” then it must have been then.
Npc_Kurt
Player
That's why I want you to find “Moon Flower”. <cf>If you find it, then I have no trouble.
Npc_Kurt
Player
If Even Adventurers Can't Find It, I Think Nora Will Be Stronger.
Npc_Kurt
Player
I want to do whatever I can for Nora. <cf>I'm sorry for sorry you to do something so sorry.
Npc_Kurt
Player
The location is' <value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/> '. <cf>Please find the 'Moon Flower' recipe. please!
Npc_Kurt
Player
If Nora really saw the “Moon Flower,” I think it was when she felt through <cf>“<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>”.
Npc_Kurt
Player
If you search the area and can't find it, <cf>Nora will want to be excited...
Npc_Kurt
Player
Please find the “Moon Flower” souvenir. please!
Npc_Kurt
Player
Something is leaving the light. <cf>Could it be the “Moonflower” that Kurt was talking about?

Npc_information
Npc_information
Adventurer. Welcome back. <cf>Did you find anything in the desert?
Npc_Kurt
Player
What is this...? Dressed? <cf>But this is the first time I've seen transparent makeup.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Big Brother, what are you holding in your hand? <cf>It's sparkling and pretty
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
Eh...? Nora! <cf>Can you see this!?
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
Yes, I can see it. <cf>It's really weird, but I can see it too.
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
wow! <cf>This is what Nora saw!
Npc_Kurt
Player
But how can that be? <cf>It's transparent, yet Nora can see it.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Yes, I think you might know. <cf>There is a doctor who is pregnant Nora's eyes.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Can I have that person deliver it? <cf>He's knowledgeable, so he might know something.
Npc_Kurt
Player
This is the “Moonflower” that Nora saw! <cf>But it's transparent, and yet Nora can see it!
Npc_Kurt
Player
The Doctor Who Examines Nora's eyes are very knowledgeable, so he might know something.
Npc_Kurt
Player
There's a doctor in this town... <cf>Can I have him deliver it to me?
Npc_Kurt
Player
I'm the doctor who's pregnant Nora... <cf>Oh, Kurt wants you to check this?
Npc_Doctor
Player
Nora also saw the “transparent shampoo”... <cf>I see. That's very tasty.
Npc_Doctor
Player
Pathways from my medical practice, I also research the Heritage and Technology of Bafaria.
Npc_Doctor
Player
I was curious if there was a clue in the Bafaria legacy about leaving Nora's eyes.
Npc_Doctor
Player
But I didn't notice the desert material. <cf>And the fairy tale “Moon Flower”
Npc_Doctor
Player
THE SHAPE SHOOT TO SHAPE THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW VIPER. <cf>However, if you say it's a pet, it looks like that.
Npc_Doctor
Player
“Moonflower” may refer to these “transparent fabrics”
Npc_Doctor
Player
Dressed, let's have a nice shower. <cf>Could you please gather some “Moonflowers” for me?
Npc_Doctor
Player
According to Legends, the “Moon Flower” Blooms at Night. <cf>It would be best to look for it in the desert at night.
Npc_Doctor
Player
I NEED SOME MORE MOONFLOWERS TO OCCUPLES. <cf>Sorry, but could you gather some for me?
Npc_Doctor
Player
According to Legends, the “Moon Flower” Blooms at Night. <cf>It would be a good idea to look for the “<value type="locationName" id="fld004_W"/>” at night.
Npc_Doctor
Player
Did you collect the “Moon Flowers”? <cf>Thank you
Npc_Doctor
Player
I am also brought into the documents of the Bafaria civilization. <cf>I found some tired passages.
Npc_Doctor
Player
I'll check it out right away, so please wait.
Npc_Doctor
Player
... Thank you for waiting. <cf>Thanks to you, I chose a lot.
Npc_Doctor
Player
The True Identity of the “Moon Flower” is The Shadows of a Shadow Viper. <cf>However, a large amount of engrams has relaxation and relaxation it.
Npc_Doctor
Player
It helps to be the effect of desert plants. <cf>Was the Moon Flower found near a plant?
Npc_Doctor
Player
It explains that the plant's engram is turning into the cleansing, turning them into transparent.
Npc_Doctor
Player
And the “Moon Flower” has a powerful power. <cf>Have you ever heard of it?
Npc_Doctor
Player
Sand Vipers and Shadow Vipers can sense the appearance and presence of prey without fear on their eyes.
Npc_Doctor
Player
According to the Tribes, similar tools were used in the Bapharian civilization.
Npc_Doctor
Player
The God of Baphalia was supposed to be able to kill the hell around him using sound and relaxation.
Npc_Doctor
Player
I'm not very good at eating the details, but... <cf>Delight, the “Moon Flower” shampoo like it could be used to treat Nora.
Npc_Doctor
Player
If we polish the “Moon Flower” and make glasses, that child might be able to see.
Npc_Doctor
Player
So I made it into glasses. <cf>Please deliver this to me.
Npc_Doctor
Player
Can it be mass-massage? <cf>That would be awesome.
Npc_Doctor
Player
It takes a long time for the relaxation to change. <cf>The Moon Flower is a precious thing.
Npc_Doctor
Player
Also, this is just a copy of the Bafaria legacy. <cf>It feels like having the exact same power.
Npc_Doctor
Player
However, it is cleansing that a new path has been cleansing for eye treatment. <cf>Medical treatments are sure to develop medicines in the future.
Npc_Doctor
Player
I'm sorry to you for that. <cf>It's a great pleasure. Thank you
Npc_Doctor
Player
Okay, enough talking. <cf>Shine up and make those clothes happy.
Npc_Doctor
Player
I chose the “Moon Flower” and made it into glasses.
Npc_Doctor
Player
Maybe he'll be able to see things. <cf>Please deliver this to Kurt and Nora.
Npc_Doctor
Player
Adventurer! <cf>Teacher, did you say something?
Npc_Kurt
Player
The “Moon Flower” glasses... <cf>If I use these, maybe I'll be able to see Nora's eyes...?
Npc_Kurt
Player
Is that really true? I'm feeling a bit tired. <cf>Look, Nora. This is it.
Npc_Kurt
Player
Okay. Then I'll give it a try.
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
... How is it, Nora? <cf>Can you see my face?
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
... No, I can't see your face. <cf>But I can vaguely see your brother's shape.
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
I see... <cf>I'm sorry I'm not being able to heal your eyes tired.
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
That's not true, Big Brother!
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
Just thinking that I have a big brother makes me so happy!
Npc_Nora
Npc_Kurt
I can see that you are there too. <cf>Thank you so much for doing this for me.
Npc_Nora
Player
Until now, I can't see anything and it was pitch black. <cf>But now I can imagine everyone a little bit.
Npc_Nora
Player
I know you're here. <cf>And that's enough
Npc_Nora
Player
... Yeah, that's right. <cf>I'm very happy too!
Npc_Kurt
Npc_Nora
Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for everything You've Done for My Sister.
Npc_Kurt
Player
I was dying to find out that “Moonflower” was a true story!
Npc_Kurt

I want to continue treating Nora shampoo <cf>and one day cure her eyes! I'll do my best!

Npc_Sulho

This is the first time I've seen such long and hard thorns.

I think it's grown a plant from a faraway country. <cf>I'm having trouble because there's no information about it.

Npc_Sulho

Adventurer, could you please go to the Asterlies Reclamation Bureau and find a book?

Npc_Sulho
Player
I think you'll find a book about this thorn in the library over there.

Npc_Sulho
Player
I will continue to try changing the soil, adding soil, and other things here.

Npc_Sulho
Player
Well then, please

Npc_Sulho

There is a library on the second floor of the Asterlies Reclamation Bureau. <cf>Look for a book about the sleeping thorns.

Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Have You Said the True Identity of the Mysterious Thorns?

Npc_Sulho
Player
Oh, so it's called Fossil Rose. <cf>There are so many different varieties of roses in the world.
>
Npc_Sulho
Player
What is needed for blooming is soil rich in engrams. <cf>Or is it to fill the engrams?

Npc_Sulho
Player
... then! <cf>You might be able to use Goblin Briar.

Npc_Sulho

Goblin Briar is a type of rose that has the ability to lose engrams.

The Fragrant Gravity Fossil Rose <cf>is changing!

It looks like the thorns are tired a little... <cf>Maybe this isn't a thorn but a bud?

Npc_Sulho

It won't bloom right away, but <cf>this should work!

Npc_Monica

What is your relationship with Sulfo-kun? <cf>Is it rude to ask you for something like this?
G
Npc_Monica

G
Npc_Monica

Adventurer. <cf>Thank you for listening to my request.
G
Npc_Monica
Player
Sulfo is my married friend, a boy who works at a rose garden.
G
Npc_Monica

That Sulfo-kun brings a bouquet of roses to an adult woman!
G
Npc_Monica
Player
Roses, a rose of roses! <cf>This is what it means, isn't it?
G
Npc_Monica
Player
I wonder if boys really do like those feelings of grown-up people...?
G
Npc_Monica
Player
... Ah, oh no! <cf>It was nothing!
G
Npc_Monica
Player
Feels, I want to know what kind of relationship they have!
G
Npc_Monica

My sister was wearing the uniform of the Reclamation Bureau. <cf>Also, she prepares her handkerchief.

G
Npc_Cecile

These Are Rose Seeds From The Outer Thoughts That Sulfo-kun From The Rose Garden Asked Me to Get.
G
Npc_Cecile
Player
Eh? Are you dating Sulfo-kun...?
G
Npc_Cecile
Player
Haha! That can't be true. <cf>Sulfo-kun is still a child.
G
Npc_Cecile
Player
I deliver deliveries and they help me with plant research. <cf>We do have business relationships like that.
G
Npc_Cecile

G
Npc_Cecile
Player
Eh? Are you here to deliver a package from Cecil?
G
Npc_Sulho
Player
Wow, I'm so happy. <cf>These Are The Rose Seeds From The Outer Thoughts That I Asked For!
G
Npc_Sulho
Player
Thank you, Adventurer. <cf>Yes Here's a bouquet of flowers as a thank you.
G
Npc_Sulho
Player
THIS IS A ROSE I CUT OFF DURING PRUNING. <cf>I used it as a small thank you gift
G
Npc_Sulho
Player
I also wanted some to Cecil-san. <cf>Adventurers, please feel free to take some.
G
Npc_Sulho
Player
I have a lot. <cf>Oh, maybe I should give some to Monica too?
G
Npc_Sulho
Player
Adventurer, do you have something to say to Monica? <cf>If so, please give her this shampoo.
G
Npc_Sulho

Welcome back, adventurer. <cf>Cecil, did you find me?
G
Npc_Monica
Player

G
Npc_Monica
Player
Phew... That's a relief. <cf>But then why a bouquet of roses...?
G
Npc_Monica
Player
Eh? <cf>A bouquet of roses from Sulfo-kun to me?
G
Npc_Monica
Player
Kyaaa, I'm so happy! <cf>Could it be that, Sulfo-kun, you're talking about me...?
G
Npc_Monica
Player
... Pruned roses as a thank you...? <cf>So there's no deep-seated behind it...
G
Npc_Monica
Player
So, it was all just my jumping to death. <cf>Ugh, I'm so tired...
G
Npc_Monica
Player
But I think it's very sulfo-like and wonderful. <cf>Because he cherries flowers are very much.
G
Npc_Monica
Player
That's what I like about him... <cf>Um, um, it's nothing. hehehe
G
Npc_Monica

It's a light source for miners. <cf>This is a bit special.

We use “Audal Thoughts” which do not emit soot, <cf>and these are also very harmful.

I ate the foam, walk the cart and run away... <cf>When I lost, the excited were gone.

That idiot Isaac... He's a hopeless guy, but I feel that there's some potential in that kid.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Player
I have strength or guts. <cf>But there is something shining in my eyes when I look at stones.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Player
It's a great talent. It would be a waste to waste it on something so trivial.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Player
Yeah, that's it! If you could just get the crystal back, everything would be fine.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_18_00_01001"/>Wouldon't be that sad. <cf>You loved like a good player.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Player
Get back the “Audal Crystal” and return it to Isaac.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Player
If you carry it again, it will be back to normal. <cf>I don't want to make it a big deal if possible.
H
Npc_Bouwman

Would you please help Isaac and us out? please!
H

H
Npc_Isak

Npc_Bouwman
You idiot!! <cf>Do you know why I'm angry?
H
Npc_Bouwman

It's not because you stole the “Audal Crystal”. <cf>IT'S BECAUSE YOU RAN AWAY FROM YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WITH YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS!
H
Npc_Bouwman
Npc_Isak
Failure is injury. It's wrong that I have a bad memory. <cf>But unfortunately,
H
Npc_Bouwman
Npc_Isak
You'll lose your job and your friends. <cf>Got it?
H
Npc_Bouwman
Npc_Isak
YES I'm sorry, boss! <cf>I did something unforgivable!
H
Npc_Isak
Npc_Bouwman
I HID MY HANDS AND THEN DRAGED OTHER PEOPLE INTO IT. <cf>It's all my faults! I'm so sorry!
H
Npc_Isak
Npc_Bouwman
That's fine. <cf>I should have done that from the beginning.
H
Npc_Bouwman
Npc_Isak
I don't have any feelings of firing you. <cf>We're short on manpower too.

Engram and Iron are combined deep underground to form a metal. <cf>It has high heat resistance.

This is “Bafaria Marble”. <cf>It's not a mineral, it's a kind of ancient relic.

It is said that God of Baphalia brought the Earth to create the temple.

It's strong and light, and a first-class building material, but <cf>it has to be given to the Bafaria cult.

He was talented with a talent for seeing stones, and was also very strong.
T
Npc_Bouwman

I'm nothing special, I've become the best miner. <cf>But he said he wanted to be an actor.
T

@
Npc_Barni
Npc_Female_Member
That's why the Reclamation Bureau is not looking for such people.
@
Npc_Female_Member
Npc_Barni
Other people have also given the bandits. <cf>We can't give relaxation treatment to specific adventurers.

How should I handle this issue? <cf>Is it long to lose in a mysterious's private life?

I'm sorry to have to ask you to take this on. <cf>Our Miner, Akka, Haven't Been Working at All Beginners.
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
It's not that he's sick or sick. <cf>I think he might be thinking about something.
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
I think, or rather, Akka is tired!
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
It's a private matter. <cf>Does Akka have a lover?
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
So, [“] he came to me for advice because he wanted to hate. <cf>I told him, [“] why don't you just do it?
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
A little while later, <cf>Akka started a strange feeling.
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
So what? My bad advice says Akka to reject my proposal...!
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
I'm responsible for this, right? <cf>Well, maybe not.
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
But that's how I feel! <cf>Oh, I shouldn't have said that!
D
Npc_Lasha

Oh no, I'll have to lose! <cf>please! Make the shampoo clear!
D
Npc_Lasha

Adventurer? What can I help you with?
D
Npc_Aca

D
Npc_Aca
Player
Proposals, I propose with <cf>Rasha-san about proposing to my girlfriend.
D
Npc_Aca
Player
Then I lost the “silver and ruby ring” I was using to lose to her.
D
Npc_Aca
Player
In other words, it's not a failed proposal or anything. <cf>It's more of a problem than that...
D
Npc_Aca
Player
'<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>' I think it was meant into the river in the Ritze Cave <cf>
D
Npc_Aca
Player
And that made me tired. <cf>It's even affected by my work. Ugh, how pathetic.
D
Npc_Aca
Player
... what? Rasha thought the proposal had failed...
D
Npc_Aca
Player
Are you dying to being between them yourself?! <cf>That's not good!
D
Npc_Aca
Player
I haven't told her anything yet! <cf>This is bound to get excited!
D
Npc_Aca
Player
That's right! Adventurer, please! <cf>Find the ring!
D
Npc_Aca
Player
All we need is that! <cf>I'll keep Rasha!
D
Npc_Aca
Player
The “Silver and Ruby Ring” has fallen into the <cf>river at '<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>'! Please help me!
D
Npc_Aca

Did you find the 'Silver and Ruby Ring' I loved?
D
Npc_Aca
Player
It must be in the river at<value type="locationName" id="fld003_E"/>! <cf>Delight and find it!

Thank goodness. Now I can manage. <cf>Well, Rasha found out after all.
D
Npc_Aca
Player
You're such an idiot! If you lost your ring, you should have come to me for advice advice.
D
Npc_Lasha
Npc_Aca
I was pregnant. <cf>I almost asked her.
D
Npc_Lasha
Npc_Aca
[“] Was AKKA's proposal so bad? [”] <cf>What
D
Npc_Lasha
Npc_Aca
No, sorry, please give me a break! <cf>I even borrowed my salary from Rasha-san in advance.
D
Npc_Aca
Npc_Lasha
I thought I couldn't have caused any more trouble. <cf>So I kept quiet.
D
Npc_Aca
Npc_Lasha
But I'm sorry for leaving a gap in my work. <cf>I'm leaving on it.
D
Npc_Aca
Npc_Lasha
You're a lucky member of our team, so <cf>money is not a big deal.
D
Npc_Lasha
Npc_Aca
I want you to continue to earn a good income. <cf>It would be a big blow to us if you stopped working.
D
Npc_Lasha
Npc_Aca
Expectations, if you found the ring then that's the end of the matter. <cf>I HOPE TO HEAR GOOD NEWS NEXT TIME!
D
Npc_Lasha
Npc_Aca
I wanted it! <cf>I'll continue to work hard!
D
Npc_Aca
Npc_Lasha
Oh man, that was close. <cf>I Almost Ruined My Desperate's Proposal.
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
Thank you too <cf>Great job!
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
Akka is happy these days
D
Npc_Lasha
Player
It seemed like the proposal went well. <cf>What do you think? Maybe I should ask for more details!

N
Npc_Volker
Npc_Chilmiar
Unless the Priest here is wrong, I can't ask him to do any work.
N
Npc_Volker
Npc_Chilmiar
It would be fine if it was someone's introduction...
N
Npc_Volker
Npc_Chilmiar
what? <cf>Were you married to that guy on the roof of the Reclamation Bureau?
N
Npc_Volker
Npc_Chilmiar
I see! Then you don't have to worry. <cf>It's an introduction from a former Top Adventurer of the Reclamation Bureau!
N
Npc_Volker
Npc_Chilmiar
Okay, I'm counting on you. <cf>This is a pain. Help me out.
N
Npc_Volker
Npc_Chilmiar
Yes, will you accept it? <cf>The Priest Over Here Will Explain the Thoughts.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
I'm Killmeyer. Nice to meet you. <cf>I'm a teenager of the Bafaria cult.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
First of all, this request is voluntary. <cf>Please don't talk about the job outside.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
That's why I was leaving people out. <cf>I'm sorry if I offended you.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
Now, let's get to the point
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
If you are an adventurer, you may have heard of it. <cf>Recently, there has been a rumor going around.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
["] The Rumor Goes That Avaritia Is Born When Ordinary Animals, Demi-Animals, and Disciplines Transforms...”
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
I should point out that this is not true. <cf>At least, this is something that has not been confirmed by the cult.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
They were so inspired of Avaritia that they <cf>created a baseless tale.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
But there are some who really believe it. <cf>Will One Day I Too Change?
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
And recently, Strange Drugs has been busy.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
It's called “Avaritia therapeutic medicine.” <cf>It depends someone is selling it.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
It's relaxing shampoo. <cf>Adventurers and <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/> are getting caught up in it.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
By the way, it sold to be sold for a convenience price. <cf>It's a price that will make your shampoo shake! Gahaha!
N
Npc_Volker
Player
So I want to find out what the drug is, so I want you to get it for me.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
IT WILL BE TOO LATE IF IT TOO LATE AMONG THE CITIZENS. <cf>I WANT TO DEAL WITH IT TOGETHER NOW
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
'<value type="locationName" id="fld001_W"/>' in Asteria Plains. <cf>It feels to be loved among the <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/> in that place.

N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
The <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/> in that area is tough to beat. <cf>Be relaxed.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
Hey, good job. <cf>Did you get the “Avaritia Medicines Medicine”?
N
Npc_Volker
Player
Oh, so that's it. <cf>Well, let's analyze it a bit.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
Hahaha! <value type="enemyName" id="E300_00_00_01001"/>fools! <cf>You Really Took This Was Medicine!
N
Npc_Volker
Player
This is all just water mixed with flavorings and sugar. <cf>It's a delicious sweet juice.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
Even if it's something like this, if you drink it, you'll feel better. <cf>It does have that much effect benefits.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
They're sweet! <cf>Just sugar! Gahaha!
N
Npc_Volker
Player
So it was just a scam with a fake product. <cf>That's a relief for now.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
But it's the person who made this fake medicine has knowledge. <cf>At least they know Avaritia.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
Unless You Are a Priest or an Adventurer Who Comes Into Direct Contact with It, You Would Only Know About It in a Priest or Fairy Tales.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
Without a doubt level of knowledge, the idea of a harmful drug would not be harmful to oneself.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
If the people are winning are the Priests... <cf>They are traitors. Their suggestions should not be allowed.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
I will track down the drug sales route. <cf>If anything seems to happen, I'd like to hate on you again.
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
You have proven your motivation in this case. <cf>Be proud of yourself
N
Npc_Chilmiar
Player
Killmeyer is busy looking into that drug.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
The things you chose were given to the kids in the neighborhood.
N
Npc_Volker
Player
It was a sneaky fake, but <cf>I made them happy.

I Came Across One Once and Chased Them Away <cf>Maybe they saw me fighting?

I see, so maybe that's why you misunderstood.
E
Npc_Tulka
Player
Sorry. Can you help me <cf>clear my name?
E
Npc_Tulka
Player
I want to be tired “<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>”
E
Npc_Tulka

But I might miss it if I go alone. <cf>Could you split up and search for it?

E
Npc_Tulka

No one benefits from that benefit.
E
Npc_Tulka
Player
Well, you're going to report to the client, right? <cf>May I celebrate you?
E
Npc_Tulka

It was not Tsurukha who was attacking the traveler. <cf>I NEED TO LET THEM KNOW THAT IT WAS “<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>”

E
Npc_Tulka
Npc_Galb
Tsuruka... <cf>Eh! Why did you bring him here!?
E
Npc_Galb
Npc_Tulka
You're an adventurer who wants to sleep, right?
E
Npc_Galb
Npc_Tulka
That's a misunderstanding. <cf>It's dangerous that I would attack a traveler.
E
Npc_Tulka
Npc_Galb
The Culprit is “”<value type="enemyName" id="E000_19_04_01001"/>. <cf>The Adventurer Who Accepted Your Request Has Requested Him.
E

Npc_Galb

I was cleaning the attic, and <cf>there was so much dust.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
It's a place I've left thoughts for a long time. <cf>It had things stored there that I'd forgotten.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
X
I found something that feels like a Buffalian Relic in the Attic of My Barn.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
According to a note that came with it, <cf>it was something that my late father borrowed from someone.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
No matter how old it is, <cf>you can't just borrow it.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
So, I want you to find the person who borrowed it.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
“Borrowed from Ma.” <cf>Maybe it's a nickname for the person.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
He has a casual vibe, so I think he's one of the kinds of Salamzahd.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Someone from the same generation as my father... <cf>Samuel-san?
^
Npc_Bale
Player
She's a knowledgeable old lady. <cf>You might like the nickname “Ma.”
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Well then, I look forward to working with you.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Ask Samuel about a person named “Ma”
^
Npc_Bale
Player
I think it's someone my father inherited from. <cf>I don't know who it is.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Oh, hello, adventurer. <cf>What's up?
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Oh. Vail asked you to talk about old times?
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Yes, yes. <cf>I know Bale's father.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
He was a serious and honest person. <cf>We used to play together a lot when we were kids.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Check out the stalls and go out to the desert for a bit...
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
I was almost dead by a monster outside the city. It was a shock.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. <cf>I JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE PAST.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
I Don't Remember Lending Anything to Him. <cf>... Did he write “something borrowed from Ma”?
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Ma... Ma. Ah! <cf>That's what Manfredo was called.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Come to think of it, I remember being close with Bale's father too.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
I tend to forget things these days, but I remember things from the past very well.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Visit Manfredo
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
Manfredo was called “Ma”
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
He lives in Salamzahd, so come and visit him.
^
Npc_Samuel
Player
what? Did I end something to Bale's father?
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Remembering, I don't remember...
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
... Hmm, no. <cf>Now that you mention it, that's true!
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
My father told Bale that he still felt he the Bafaria died.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
My dad's name was Marty. <cf>He likes to collect strange things.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
The nickname “Ma” married to his father.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
My father has passed away. <cf>I had forgotten about it.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
I don't know what it is, but <cf>if you can give it back, I'd like it.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Tell Bale
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
“Something Borrowed from Ma” is borrowed from Bafaria that my father lent me.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
I would be happy if you could give it back. <cf>Please tell Mr. Bale.
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Hey Adventurer. <cf>Have You Found Out Anything About “Borrowing from Mar”?
^
Npc_Bale
Player
... I see. <cf>So it was about Manfredo's father.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Of course, I'd like to return it right away.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
It feels like my shampoo isn't working. <cf>It feels like it broke because I left it alone for so long.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
I feel it up and it feels like you can adjust it with the <cf>“High Pressure Liquid Pipe” that can be felt from <value type="enemyName" id="E003_05_00_02001"/>
^
Npc_Bale
Player
“<value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>” <cf>
^
Npc_Bale
Player
I'm sorry I borrowed it for so long and then broke it. <cf>IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT I SHOULD FIX IT TOUCH AND RETURN IT.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Expect me, but could you please go to <value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/> 'and bring me the <cf>'High Pressure Liquid Pipe'?
^
Npc_Bale
Player
Get the “High Pressure Liquid Pipe” to repair the Bafaria Relic.
^
Npc_Bale
Player
'<value type="locationName" id="pat0102"/>' should be able to get it from <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E003_05_00_02001"/>. PLEASE.

Npc_Bale

Oh, thank you! <cf>You feel me the “high pressure liquid pipe”

Now, let's repair the legacy.

Player
...

Npc_Bale
Player
... Yeah, it worked to work now. <cf>Good, good.

Could you please return this to Manfredo? <cf>Please tell him I'm sorry I kept it for so long.

Npc_Bale
Player
Return Manfredo's shampoo
^
Npc_Bale
Player
I'm sorry I kept it for so long. <cf>It would be nice if you could tell me that.

Npc_Bale
Player
Oh, so you've been tired with the Bafaria sweater by Mr. Bale?
^
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Hmm. I did get it back. <cf>Thank you for your hard work.

Npc_Manfredo

In the previous stage production, he became a priest who was dedicated to his work, and <cf>[confession] with a girl who came to him, awakening to a forbidden love.

That's why I've been leaving to hold back feelings
S
Npc_Einar

Saved, you saved me. <cf>Oh. Do I need to sign it?

Of course, I'll write a thank you note. <cf>I'll include the recipient's name.

I want to say something... I want to talk... <cf>I want to share Einar's secrets with my comrades...

Npc_Toregano

]
Npc_Toregano
Player
Ugh. That's pretty sweet...
]
Npc_Toregano
Player
No, but Detlef is right. <cf>It was not good to leave my daughter alone.
]
Npc_Toregano
Player
Okay. <cf>I'll write the rest when I get back to Salamzahd.
]
Npc_Toregano
Player
You're going to report to Roubel too, aren't you? <cf>May I come with you?

Npc_Toregano

Npc_Rowbel
Npc_Toregano
Oh, thank you very much. <cf>It's my job and I love it.
]
Npc_Toregano
Npc_Rowbel
Then draw me a picture
]
Npc_Rowbel
Npc_Toregano
Dad, you only draw clothes and <cf>not me, do you?
]
Npc_Rowbel
Npc_Toregano
I make a good picture.
]
Npc_Rowbel
Npc_Toregano
... That's a good one. <cf>That's right true. Let's get started right away.
]
Npc_Toregano
Npc_Rowbel
Adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry for the dead.

Npc_Toregano
Player
When it comes to painting, I get painted away. <cf>That's my bad side.

Npc_Rowbel

Dad, are you drawing a picture of me?

Enough! Why won't my father and mother kill me?
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
I have a dream too. <cf>I want to become a teenager and perform on a glamorous stage!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
@
I'm Emile. I want to be a teenager!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
But my father and mother are against it. <cf>No matter how much I try to kill them, they won't leave me.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
But the other day, my father finally said, <cf>[“] I'll give you an assignment, so show me how to do it [”]
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
If I chose this, they would hate me!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
But it's quite uncomfortable, and I don't think I can do it by myself.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
So I chose to hire an adventurer. <cf>I wasn't told not to hire one!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
The task is to lose precious stones found in the desert.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
2 “Sand Flowers” and 1 “Leaf Stone”
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Let's Start by Looking for “Sandflower.” <cf>It seemed to be found at “Hermit's Well”.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Well then, let's go to the Hermit's Well!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
There it is! <cf>It's “Sandflower”!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
The “Sand Flower” is a stone worn by the songstress during the Star Spirit Festival long ago.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
It was so beautiful that it seemed in everyone's minds.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Since then, it has become famous as a talisman for girls who are tired for something.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
If left as is, it just looks like a regular rock, but if you polish it patiently it will turn a beautiful pink color.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
There should be one more thing, “Sandflower” in “Khartoum Ruins”
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Let's find out
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Yes, I found it! <cf>It's “Sandflower”.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Now we have two Sandflowers. <cf>Now we just need to find the Leaf Stone.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Where is the “Leaf Stone”...?
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Oh, I remember now! They can be found in the thoughts of <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/>in '<value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>'
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
... Oh, Father! <cf>What the hell are you asking me to get!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
I can't fight <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/> after all.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Sorry, Adventurer. Could you please gather some Leaf Stones from <cf><value type="locationName" id="fld004_N"/>?
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
I'll just be a drag, so I'll go back to Salamzahd first.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
In the shower, I'll polish the Sandflower.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
“Sand Flower” and “Leaf Stone” can only shine if they are worn by hand.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
It takes perseverance, but I'm tired in that.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
I'll leave the stone to you. <cf>Adventurer, please give me the 'Leaf Stone'!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Welcome back, Adventurer! <cf>I see you found the Leaf Stone.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Thank you very much. <cf>I'll polish it up right away and show it to my father.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Just wait, father! <cf>YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING FROM ME NOW!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
[--] I'm back! <cf>Hey, Adventurer, Will You Listen to Me?
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Dad is so mean! <cf>He says things like this
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
[“] I didn't think you could do it alone, but <cf>I thought you'd hire an adventurer ["]
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
["] Well done this time. <cf>But this is only the first test! ["]
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
[“] Once You Had the Second and Third Trials, <cf>You'll Have No Problem Thinking About It! [”]
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
First of all, what would you do if I were to fight with <value type="enemyName" id="E017_01_00_01001"/> If you ask me...
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
[“] I thought I raised him so that he could be at least judge whether he could fight or not.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Does he trust his daughter or not? <cf>Which is it?
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
If there is so much trouble, maybe I should just run away from home? <cf>I thought that, but...
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
I want my family to give their blessing to my dream.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
So, I'll do my best! <cf>I'll make them approve my become a teenager!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
Thank you so much this time. <cf>PLEASE LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH AGAIN FOR MY DREAM!
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
My father and mother still don't worry to want to let me become a teenager.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
But having completed this challenge, I feel like my outlook has changed a little.
F
Npc_Emiere
Player
I will never give up!

She went on a mission to<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>. <cf>I GUESS ONLY HER LUGGGAGE was left behind...
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Dear, I'm sorry again. <cf>Would you be able to take on my request?
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Thank you <cf>Let me explain the explanation.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
I am a victim of a suicide incident.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Recently, we have confirmed a confirmed in which graveyards have been vandalized in various places across Asteria Plain by someone.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Was it lying by a monster or by human hands? <cf>We are talking about that issue as well.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
I sent my thoughts Cecil to tears, but things felt a bit lost.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
So I asked for your help.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Cecil is a young man with a lot of potential. <cf>I thought that there would be no problem if I left it to her.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
But when he told me about the grave robbery, I thought that he had a very beautiful look on his face.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
There is the backpack you found.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
I have a bad feeling about this... <cf>Sorry, but could you please find her first?
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Cecil should have gone to the Garrison in. <value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/> <cf>Please go and check on her.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
He has ordered his fate Cecil to kill the series of Grave Robbers.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
<value type="locationName" id="fld001_N"/>Should be heading to the “garrison” there. <cf>Please go and check on her.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
YES I am Cecil, the one who is dying the grave robbery.
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
... At Sisto's Request <cf>Come and Check On Me?
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Thank you for that. <cf>Sist, were you tired?
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
I can't fight, but I rushed out in a panic...
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Sorry for the bad
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
I did some research on the grave robbery. <cf>The Culprit is a group LED by <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
I don't know the reason or purpose of robbing the tomb. <cf>There's no evidence that goblins have that kind of behavior...
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
... Shame, My Grandmother's Grave was also vandalized by Goblins.
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
When I Went to Visit the Grave, The Grave Marker Had Fallen Over. <cf>The ground had also been dug up.
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
After hearing Mr. Sisto's story, I just can't sit still...
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
And that's how I got to this point
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>Adventurer, could you please leave? <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
He's tired in a tricky place... <cf>You'll find him at '' <value type="locationName" id="dng004"/>
_
Npc_Cecile

Once the Group Disappointed, The Graves Will Not Be Ravaged. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>Please leave them alone!

Npc_Cecile

Npc_Cecile
Player
The Flock Thought to Have Been Dressed. <cf>NOW THE GRAVES WILL NOT BE FORESTED
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
I'm sure your shampoo will be able to sleep peacefully.
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Now that I think about it, while you were fighting, I was fighting, I was fighting the area around the ravaged graveyard...
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Some of the Goblin Corpses Had Marks That Stabbed Like They Had Been Stabbed.
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
It felt like he was stabbed quite violently, over and over again. <cf>The musicians were about the size of a stick from <value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Is this also the work of<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>?
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Creepy, it's a little creepy. <cf>I'll report this to Mr. Cyst.
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
Expect me, Adventurer. <cf>Could you please come with me to Mr. Sisto?
_
Npc_Cecile
Player
I hope you're safe, Cecil. <cf>Let's be happy about that first.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
And you too. <cf>Thank you for your relaxation request.
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Now, let's hear the report on the grave robbery. <cf>What on Earth Scissors, Cecil?
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
Delectable...

Npc_Cecile
Npc_Sisto

Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile

Npc_Sisto
Player
Cecil I chose the shampoo. <cf>Please be careful in your actions from now on.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
<cf>Your feelings have asked me not to hurt you.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
Oh... Yes, I'm tired. <cf>Sorry, Mr. Sisto
_
Npc_Cecile
Npc_Sisto
Also, what Bothers Me is the Strange Traces Left on the Goblin's Corpse.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
It looked like something was stabbed violently. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>'S CANE-LIKE MARK...
_
Npc_Cecile
Npc_Sisto
That's right. <cf>This is just a joke, but...
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>MAY HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF DRILLING BY DRILLING HOLES IN THE CORPSES.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
There are many mysteries out there Goblin Culture and Thought, and it's Impossible to Speak with Thought.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
<value type="enemyName" id="E000_05_00_02001"/>IS A Highly Intelligent Monster. <cf>It is meant that this individual had its own unique set of values.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
THE GRAVE ROBBERS MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A BODY TO MAKE A HOLE IN.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
Verification is useful, but let's record it for reference. <cf>Thank you for your hard work, Cecil.
_
Npc_Sisto
Npc_Cecile
YES Thank you
_
Npc_Cecile
Npc_Sisto
You have been a great help to me. <cf>You have healthy relaxation information. Thank you
_
Npc_Sisto
Player
Individual monsters among monsters are not common. <cf>Expecting this can cause the Bureau of Reclamation's predictions to go awry.

Player
We will continue our prayers. <cf>We would like your favorite again.

Npc_Sisto

Cecil set out to restore the vandalized cemetery.

I'm a calligrapher. <cf>It's not that well known in this town yet.
a
Npc_Bakhyt
Player
Calligraphy is not about how well you write your characters. <cf>It's about putting your heart and emotions into it.

Npc_Bakhyt

That is to say, calligraphy is... Oh, sorry. <cf>I have to talk about the request.

Then my granddaughter Lindsay said she would take over the business.
a
Npc_Bakhyt
Player
Of course, I'd like it. But...
a
Npc_Bakhyt
Player
I started to wonder if maybe she was tired too hard just to be jealous of me.
a
Npc_Bakhyt
Player
Does Lindsay really want to live as a calligrapher? <cf>I want to know what she's really excited.
a
Npc_Bakhyt

My grandpa is a calligrapher. <cf>Hmm, I see. You're talking about a success.

Grandpa is so clumsy. <cf>I wish he'd just ask me questions.

Npc_Lynsey
Player
Don't worry. <cf>I'm serious about becoming a calligrapher.

Npc_Lynsey
Player
Heartfelt Writing Can Move the Hearts of Those Who See It. <cf>Grandpa Buffett explains me that.

Npc_Lynsey

If you put words like this on a sign or poster in your store, it will catch the attention of a lot of people, right?

Npc_Lynsey
Player
If it's cool or beautiful, <cf>everyone might like the greatness of calligraphy!

Npc_Lynsey
Player
If you don't mind, could you help me put up the trouble?

My coolness is so fast, but <cf>its coolness doesn't match its speed.

I thought it would be cool if I added a flag to give it a sense of speed.
a
Npc_Lysander
Player
But I have no talent, and I can't write. <cf>So I have to give up? That's not cool.

a
Npc_Lynsey
Npc_Bakhyt

If I could do that, maybe everyone at school would accept me a little more...

... what?! <cf>Yuska-kun had GONE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE BY SIDES?!
S
Npc_Iciar
Player
Why did you do that? <cf>That's dangerous!
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
I'm sorry. <cf>But it was written in “Keon's Adventure Record”
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
“Being an adventurer is not a teenager. Who Has An Adventurous Spirit Is An Adventurer.”
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
“And the Thoughts of an Adventurer are not physical strength or wisdom.”
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
“The ability to believe in yourself and draw out your hidden potential that you don't even know you have. <cf>In other words, college.”
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
I want to prove that I'm brave
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
Yes, there is such a passage. <cf>But Yuska, your actions are not proof of college.
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
“Only the courageous can fail”
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
“Let us remember bitter memories and use them to guide us tomorrow. We must not forget the college to accept our motivation.”
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
“To die like a beast, without fear for one's own failure. <cf>That is one of the most foolish disgrace.”
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
Is the college Keon is talking about when you think yourself while doing something that makes someone worry?
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
That's...
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
You're not loading enough, boy.
S
Npc_Iciar
Npc_Juska
Yes... I was long. <cf>Sorry, Ishial
S
Npc_Juska
Npc_Iciar
I just want you to lose. <cf>Don't be so reckless again.

Yuska-kun was safe, and the book was safe. <cf>Thank you, Adventurer.

I'm Glad I Asked You, Adventurer <cf>People like you are the ones that children look up to.
S
Npc_Iciar
Player
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Thank you for your help with Yuska-kun.
S
Npc_Iciar

Yuska-kun has been on his actions since then. <cf>It taught him made some friends because he chose college.

This has never happened before. <cf>So I'd like you to find out the cause.

Npc_Manfredo

First, can you stay <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>in '<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>'?

Stay <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> in <value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/> 'and <cf>keep them away from my fields.

Look, this is it. <cf>IT'S A BEAUTIFUL RED JEWEL THAT I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED.

Player
... Wait a sec. <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>Only shampoo after I shower this gem.

Npc_Manfredo

And the Gem Lost Its Shine <cf>Right After You Might<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>...
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Is there something to <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>do with this gem
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Could you please get the story from the Adventurer who sold me this gem?
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
She's A Female Adventurer named Durga. <cf>She should be in this town, so look for her.
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Please find the female adventurer named Durga who sold me the red jewel.
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
He should be tired in Salamzahd. <cf>If you're an adventurer, he's going to be near the Reclamation Bureau.
\
Npc_Manfredo

Does The Red Jewel that Manfredo have? <cf>Oh, I sold it.

So that motivation. <cf>I found that mystery in the ruins.

Npc_Durga

I thought it was pretty and worth it. <cf>Manfredo wants it for me.

Npc_Durga
Player
... Wait a minute. <cf>You Said That Began <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> Thoughts, Right?

Npc_Durga
Player
A while ago, I was tired by monsters a lot.
\
Npc_Durga
Player
But now I'm okay. <cf>... That's right. Since I let go of that red jewel
\
Npc_Durga
Player
Could it be that the red gem is a <cf>dangerous monster?
\
Npc_Durga
Player
If so, that's bad! <cf>This should be supposed to happen
\
Npc_Durga
Player
You Might Be Able to Find Some Information at the Asterlies Reclamation Bureau.
\
Npc_Durga
Player
I'll help you too. <cf>Let's Go to Asterlies
\
Npc_Durga
Player
Have you found anything about the Red Gem?
\
Npc_Durga
Player
Oh, this book? Let's see...
\
Npc_Durga
Player
“Once upon a time, there was a cursed five-sided jewel.”
\
Npc_Durga
Player
“The Red Gem has the Power to Attract Monsters to the Area Attracts the Person Who Attracts It.”
\
Npc_Durga
Player
“When the Power of the Curse is Exerted, The Gem Shines Brightly.”
\
Npc_Durga
Player
“When The Curse's Misfortune Is Too Off, The Jewel Goes Its Shine.”
\
Npc_Durga
Player
“But the power of the curse did not shine, and the gem appeared to shine again...”
\
Npc_Durga
Player
<cf>You Said That Manfredo's Jewels No Longer Glowed?
\
Npc_Durga
Player
If that's the cursed gem, <cf>maybe it'll shine again?
\
Npc_Durga
Player
This Means That Monster Might Come Again at Manfredo's Place!
\
Npc_Durga
Player
This is bad! <cf>Let's return to Salamzahd immediately!
\
Npc_Durga
Player
Oh! It's you! <cf>And Durga is with you too.
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Listen! <cf>The Red Gem has started to glow again!
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Overlapping it, <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>also lying!
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
I wanted it! <cf>Mr. Manfredo, that is a cursed gem.
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
When It Shines, It Shines, and When It's Shines, It Shines
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
BUT THE POWER OF THE CURSE DOESN'T SHINE, SO IF IT STARTS TO SHINE AGAIN, MONSTERS WILL SURPRISE.
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
What the hell did they sell me!
\
Npc_Manfredo
Npc_Durga
I didn't know! <cf>I'm sorry, that's why I came here
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
Thoughts, first let's go to. <value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/> <cf>We can't talk until we get rid of them.
\
Npc_Durga

Npc_Durga
Player
Sorry for bothering you so often. Please be careful <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>in “<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>”

Npc_Manfredo

Even so, I can't believe that such a beautiful sweater is cursed...
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
<value type="enemyName" id="E016_01_00_01001"/>. <cf>Thank you for that. Thank you
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
But the red gem has lost its shine again...
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Hey, Mr. Manfredo. <cf>I'll give you your money back, so you should give up the jewels.
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
It is a gem that curses its owner.
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
I can't let someone else have it either. <cf>Maybe I should ask the Bureau of Reclamation to look after it.
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
Hmm, but... Such a beautiful gem is not something you can find very often.
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
Is there any way to lift the curse?
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
There may be, but I don't know yet.
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
Well, jewels are beautiful, but... <cf>Is Your Life More Important, Isn't It?
\
Npc_Durga
Npc_Manfredo
Uuuuuhhhmm...
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
... You're the right. I have no choice. <cf>It's a pleasure to have to part with the jewels.
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
I was the one who asked you to find out the cause. <cf>Yes, I wanted it.
\
Npc_Manfredo
Player
I will deliver the gem to the Reclamation Bureau. <cf>I'm sorry for my caregiving you so much trouble because of my caregiving.
\
Npc_Durga
Player
Thanks to you, the damage from the curse was harmful. <cf>I would like to thank you. Thank you
\
Npc_Durga
Player
Oh my! <cf>Have You Broken the Curse of That Red Gem?

Npc_Aleni

Please take Mr. Bosch to the store. <cf>Thank you very much.
e
Npc_Aleni

The Adventurer was originally with Bosch.
e
Npc_Aleni
Player
I believe he is in Asterlies, so please bring him here.
e
Npc_Aleni
Player
Huh? Isn't that the Adventurer from before?
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
See, You Asked for Medicine to Stop You From Feeling the Spice So That You Could Eat Areni's Super Spicy Food, Right?
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
I remember it well because I ruined the taste of her cooking and cooking trouble for the adventurers.
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
I still can't eat spicy food, but I'm working on it bit by bit.
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
So that one day I can finish Areni's food and tell her it was delicious.
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
Eh...? <cf>That Areni interview to meet me!?
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
I was thinking of going to eat it after I had to lose my palate a bit more, but...
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
This might be your chance to confess your motivation to her!
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
Of course I'll go! <cf>Oh, but it would be rude to come empty-handed.
e
Npc_Bosch
Player
Okay, let's give her a treat! <cf>I want to give Areni a “Pure White Sun Flower”

Hello, Mr. Bosch. <cf>You came to our store before.

Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
But he was very hungry while eating. <cf>I was very tired...
e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
Didn't you like my food?
e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
No, it's not! <cf>Your cooking was the best... I'm sure, I'm sure
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
Spice, I can't eat spicy food. <cf>At that time, I was taking medicine that made me not feel spicy food.
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
Then I can't taste anything at all.
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
I Ruined the Delicious Food. <cf>I feel so rude to you...
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
That's why I can't lift my head
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
Well, I'm sorry so. <cf>But why go to such snacks to eat my food?
e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
That is... well, ahem.
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
Ah, Areni-san! <cf>Would you please accept this joke?
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
This is how I feel!
e
Npc_Bosch
Npc_Aleni
This... for me?

Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch

e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
That's right! I've always loved you...!

The Nectar of the “Sunflower” is very sweet. <cf>If you add it to your cooking, it may give your dish a mellow flavor.
e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
Even if you don't like spicy food, you may find this dish delicious.
e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
Fufu, I'm so happy that you went to such sweets to eat my food!
e
Npc_Aleni
Npc_Bosch
Please wait. <cf>I'm going to use these flowers to make a dish now.

Player
Your name is Isaac. <cf>Oh... you're a miner working for my father.
l

In the past, I was able to overcome to succeed some success as a miner, but...

Npc_Einar

Will I wonder if my story will be of any use? <cf>Now I'm in a position where I can give my all on stage.
l
Npc_Einar
Player
Oh, of course I don't mind meeting you. <cf>I've been indebted to you, Adventurer.
l
Npc_Einar

Well then, let's go meet Isaac.
l
Npc_Einar

Isaac talks to me

l
Npc_Isak
Player
Is The Lost Child... he safe? <cf>That's good!
l
Npc_Isak
Player
Nice to meet you, Isak-san. <cf>This is Einar. I heard that my father is being taken care of by you.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
I heard that you came all the way from <cf>Ritz just to see me.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
This is a very polite guy. My name is Isaac. <cf>I'm sorry for the sorry visit.
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
I AM STILL A DEBTED, SO I AM ALWAYS INDEBTED TO MY BOSS.
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
So, I think the master would like his son, Einar, to take over the business.
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
Einar <cf>Are you planning on returning to Ritz?
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
Thank you <cf>But I felt to continue to hate.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
When the theater company Came to Ritz, and I saw their performance. <cf>I felt it was fate.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
It's true that mining may be a good fit for him. <cf>But I didn't feel like much of a destiny as I did on stage.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
Right now, I want to do my best on stage.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
Destiny... Deyasuka
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
I think my father had a vague feeling that I'm not being able to worry myself to mine.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
Right now, Isaac is more dedicated to his work as a miner than I am.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
SHE CARES ABOUT MY FATHER SO MUCH THAT SHE COME TO VISIT ME EVEN ASSED SHE DIDN'T KNOW HIM.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
I think Isaac felt that mining was his destiny.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
That may be true. <cf>I was born to be a miner.
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
It would have been helpful if I was told to quit mining. <cf>To Einar, that's what he is like as an actor.
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
It felt I was long. <cf>I'm sorry for sorry talking like this.
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
Isaac-san. <cf>Could you help My Parents as a Miner?
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
I feel relieved to have people like you around. <cf>I will also create a stage that I will not be ashamed of.
l
Npc_Einar
Npc_Isak
Leave it to us! <cf>One day, let's go see a play together!
l
Npc_Isak
Npc_Einar
Adventurer, I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've loved you.
l
Npc_Isak
Player
Without thinking about worrying things, <cf>I try to work hard at mining.
l
Npc_Isak
Player
I also had a great time. <cf>Thank you, Adventurer.
l
Npc_Einar
Player
Each of us has solved the path that we feel is destined for, <cf>and I hope we can meet like this again.

Npc_Einar

Hello, Adventurer! <cf>Thank you for your help with Einar-san's case.

My name is Gikaro! <cf>I am a New Recruit of the Glorious Duchy of Barnhardt!
l

Player
I, Adventurer, am in a good mood! <cf>... Ah, what? Something different...
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
I'm sorry... <cf>I'm tired to talk like a soldier, but I'm not used to it.
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
Well, well, there's something I'd like to ask you. <cf>Could you please listen to it?
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
The Other Day, I received a letter from my sister who lives in Kanaloa. <cf>She feels, ["Something Strange has always been tired."]
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
However, the important point about the [“Strange Thing”] is not surprising.
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
My sister is easygoing and a nice person... <cf>I know it's strange for a younger brother to say this, but I'm dying.
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
I have a mission and can't leave the castle for a while. <cf>So I thought I'd ask an adventurer for help.
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
Could you please check on my sister? <cf>If possible, please find out the reason for the strange behavior.
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
My sister's name is Amia. <cf>She lives in Kanaloa. PLEASE.

Could you please check on my sister in Kanaloa? <cf>I Hear There's Been Some ["Strange] Things Going On Feeling.

If possible, please find out the cause. <cf>He's a laid-back person, so I'm sorry about him...

Npc_Guikalo
Player
My sister's name is Amia. <cf>If I say it's a request from Gikaro, I think you'll be disappointed.
l
Npc_Guikalo
Player
Oh, hello, adventurer. <cf>Is there something I can help you with?
l
Npc_Amia
Player
... Well. At Gikaro's request? <cf>That's because younger my brother is in charge of it.
l
Npc_Amia
Player
Gikaro is a kind person who does not like arguments, but <cf>he became a soldier because it would be a way to earn money.
l
Npc_Amia
Player
Was that child dumb too hard? <cf>She's such a worrier.
l
Npc_Amia
Player
Even when I was still little... No, no. <cf>I was talking about me, not Gikaro.
l
Npc_Amia
Player
The truth is, there are so many varieties growing in my garden. <cf>And they grow every day.
l
Npc_Amia

Even if you pull them out or cut them down, they just grow back to the next day.

Npc_Amia

It would be a great help if you could look into it. <cf>Thank you, Adventurer.
l
Npc_Amia
Player
I'm having trouble with sleeping growing in my garden. <cf>No matter how many people I pull out or hunt, they grow back to the next day.
l
Npc_Amia
Player
I wonder if there's a reason for this? <cf>Do you know any old tales like this, Adventurer?
l
Npc_Amia
Player
There's a bookshelf at the Asterlies Reclamation Bureau. <cf>Could you look it up there?

Npc_Amia

l
Npc_Amia

l
Npc_Amia

Oh, maybe. <cf>Maybe it's because I cut the shampoo.

Npc_Amia

So this is a cursed gem? <cf>Oh my, Gikaro.

Maybe I didn't ask the shopkeeper interview. <cf>Oh, what a careless girl.

Adventurer, please. <cf>Please find Yoan.

Player
... whatever the circumstances, <cf>I want to get the facts straight.
d
sq101_016_step0_npc_catrla
Player
Maybe Litze can find someone who knows where Yoann is.
d
sq101_016_step0_npc_catrla
Player
Yoann didn't just do the work he was asked to do, he also asked to do, he also tried on the task of doing and tried the trouble.
d
sq101_016_step0_npc_catrla
Player
That's why I always come home late. <cf>But I wanted that about him.

d
Npc_merchant
Player
... Are you looking for someone? <cf>Oh, you're Yoann?
d
Npc_merchant
Player
By the way, I asked you to ask your name. <cf>The Other Day, I met an adventurer in the mountains.
d
Npc_merchant
Player
Thank you for wanting me when I was dying by a monster.
d
Npc_merchant
Player
It went he was in a mountain, and <cf>he went back deep into the mountains.
d
Npc_merchant
Player
That's right! <cf>I loved him a bandana as a thank you gift.
d
Npc_merchant
Player
It lost that you lost something you were using. <cf>I thought that at least that much.
d
Npc_merchant
Player
I'm glad you're the one I was looking for! <cf>I'll be able to thank you so much later.

Yoan was looking for something and looking to <cf>“” <value type="locationName" id="fld003_S"/>

Player
Can't we get closer from here?
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
... Hmm? What about you?
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
Sorry. I was looking for something. <cf>I didn't notice you until you called out to me.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I'm Yoan. <cf>I'm an adventurer, as you can see.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
What, were you looking for me?
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I see, Katya... <cf>I'm sorry about that.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
IT'S NORMAL FOR ME TO BE LATE COMING HOME, SO I ENDED UP DETERRATING TO CONTACT YOU.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
If I only received the bandana, I would have been disappointed. <cf>I did something bad to Kirsch too.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I know. I'll be back soon. <cf>But before that, there's something I need to do.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I WANT TO GET BACK THE LEATHER BAG THAT WAS STOLEN BY THE MOOKS AROUND HERE.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I have to bring that home. <cf>Hey, can you help me out while you're here?
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I HAVE MY EYE ON THE GUY WHO STOLE THE LEATHER BAG. <cf>But they're a tough pack. I'm having a hard time.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
Could you help me save my Minions? <value type="enemyName" id="E000_20_00_01001"/>. <cf>It would be great if you could have liked 15 of them.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
The Losing Guys Will Lose Control. <cf>I'll take advantage of that opportunity to get the leather bag back from the boss.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
It would be better if we went our separate ways. <cf>Let's meet up in Ritz when we're done.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
Thank you See you later.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I've been worried both Katchua and Kirsch to worry. <cf>I'll feel good when I get back.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
Before that, I have to get back the leather bag that was stolen by the Mooks.

I was able to get the leather bag back clothes. <cf>Thanks to you for coming.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
The contents are “Mikazukitake”. Do you know it? <cf>It's a mythical mushroom that is almost impossible to find mushrooms.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
And it's an essential soup in the wedding soup made by Katja's Dead Mother.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
For her, it's a taste of irreplaceable memories. <cf>So I really wanted to bring it home with me.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
I was tired because if I chose this, I might never get it again.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
But I don't want to make you worry because of that. <cf>I'll have to go home and relax.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
You're going to report to Katchua too, aren't you? <cf>If so, let's go together.
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
Stay with me a little shower until I return to the Minsterhorn
d
Npc_Yoan
Player
Let's go back to Katchua. <cf>I made you worry because of me.

sq101_016_step0_npc_catrla
This... can't be, a crescent mushroom!
d
sq101_016_step0_npc_catrla
Npc_Yoan
I was lucky enough to get it. <cf>I really wanted to give it to Katchua.

Now, please accept this sword. <cf>It is the “proof” of the Oath I made.

... Isn't it a ring? At times like this
R
Npc_Durga

It was indeed a ring material, but I broke it. <cf>So I used force to make it into part of the handle.
R
sq101_039_start_npc_ryuk
Npc_Durga
It's not impossible to remove, but... <cf>It's not strong enough to protect your fingers, is it?

I'm just leaving. <cf>Please don't talk like I'm the Mastermind.
I
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
Thank you for the poisoned accessories
I
Npc_Cya
Player
That's the way it is! Just because I used Venomeen didn't mean I poisoned the accessories!
I
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
If you had pitched it to an assassin, it might have worked, Anne.
I
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
Oh, I see. <cf>As expected of Shia! You have a unique perspective!
I
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
I don't even listen to sarcasm...
I

Npc_Anne
So, let us celebrate today's new products!
I
Npc_Anne
Player
Salamzahd is very busy, isn't it? <cf>My skin gets dry and flaky clothes.
I
Npc_Anne
Player
So I'm thinking of making a hand cream <cf>I've been thinking thought of a catchphrase.
I
Npc_Anne
Player
“Turn Desert Skin into an Oasis in an Instant!” <cf>I'm sure it'll be a big hit!
I
Npc_Anne
Player
That's a good idea for Anne. <cf>Do you have any ideas for good materials?
I
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
...?
I
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Ahem, I'm glad you asked! <cf>I chose a desert creature.
I

Npc_Cya
Its name is<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>!
I
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Even though they've been in the desert all this time, their fur is still shiny! <cf>It must have shampoo in it that make it shampoo to shampoo.
I
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Huh? No,<value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>'s hair is...
I
Npc_Cya

After all, you're going to get your hands on a monster...

Expect me, Adventurer. <cf>I'd like 5 “Dryness-Thoughtful Bristles” please.

Npc_Cya

Please feel free <cf><value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>at '<value type="locationName" id="fld004_C"/>'
I
Npc_Cya

You Should Be Able to Get “Dry Breathing Bristles,” so <cf>collect about 5 of them.
I
Npc_Cya
Player
Anne is sorry for the trouble. <cf>She always says unexplained things...
I
Npc_Cya
Player
Oh, adventurer, welcome back! <cf>Did You Get Your Hands on the “Dryness-Thoughts Bristle”?
I
Npc_Anne
Player
You have prepared everything just as I prepared. <cf>Thank you, Adventurer.
I
Npc_Cya
Player
You can make hand cream with this! <cf>Sell it under the Anne & Shea brand ♪
I
Npc_Anne
Player
Cut it into small pieces, grind it up, and extract the fat components...
I
Npc_Anne
Player
... Huh? <value type="enemyName" id="E002_00_01_01001"/>'s hair is hard. <cf>Is it rough or not... or is it bumpy?
I
Npc_Anne
Player
There are many natural wonders of them in the desert. <cf>Their body hair has evolved to be hard in order to protect hair.
I
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
If you use a shampoo made blade or blunt object, the tool will be worn.
I
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
In the past, this fur was even used to make armor.
I
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
No no, no matter how hard it is, it's still hair? <cf>It's so easy... ugh... grrrrrrr...
I

Nugu... Ugly... <span size="Big">Gyuu... Nnnnn... </>
I

Oh no, it won't bend at all. <cf>What, am I holding onto an iron bar?
I
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Adventurer, thank you for listening to Anne's selfish request.
I
Npc_Cya
Player
I think the idea is not bad, but the <cf>way it was done was just like Anne's.
I
Npc_Cya
Player
I'll tell you to just be quiet and make normal products from plants and indoor relaxation.
I
Npc_Cya
Player
This is the last resort! <cf>Maybe if I bite it, it will work! Gulp!

Npc_Tini
Player
... I can't reply to those guys. <cf>Ah, I'm so tired.
\
Npc_Tini
Player

Hey, e-chan. <cf>I'll give you an engram so come out now.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
... Kyuuuuuu...
\
Npc_Eee
Player
<cf>Yi, who has run out of engrams, is upside down
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
... ii...
\
Npc_Eee
Player
It fell into the water and was lying away...
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
Someone may be looking for it. <cf>If you know why, please let me know.
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
Ah, adventurer. <cf>Have You Seen Yi-chan Upside Down?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I've been looking for e-chan for some reason. <cf>I can't find her at all, and I'm so excited and tired
\
Npc_Tini
Player
... Did you see it? Yay~. <cf>Finally found a clue.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Thank you <cf>Could you please take on one more thing while you're at it?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'm sorry. <cf>I'm sorry for leaving you to do something teasing.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
My master's villa has a lot of Bafaria heritage on display.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
And to ensure stable operation, we also keep a lot of e-Chans.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
There are also cats, dogs, nappies, and lots of other stuff.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Rich people don't know how to handle their money. <cf>I want people to know how tiring it is to manage their money.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Oh, sorry. <cf>I was so excited that I started blurting out
\
Npc_Tini
Player
These e-Chans have gone outside the mansion.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Maybe there was an engram failure there, and <cf>he never came back.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
When those guys lose their engrams, they turn over and can't move.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Even feeling uncomfortable feeling relaxed, right? <cf>I mean, E-chan is no different.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
So, we have to retrieve E-chan.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
If You See An E-chan Upside Down In The Street, <cf>Can You Catch It And Bring It To Me?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
There are others of them, but <cf>please find one for now.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I won't be going out into the desert, so please search inside Salamzahd.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'll look around the area too, so please help me. <cf>I'm so excited now.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I think thinking in Salamzahd there is an upside-down Yi-chan.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
This must be my e-chan, so <cf>can you pick her up and bring her here?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'm so scared of all the stuff about the cat. <cf>I'm sorry I look forward to working with you.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I found an upside-down Yi
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
No reaction even when poked. <cf>It explains that the engram has expired.
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
Let's deliver it to Tini
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
Ah, thank you for your hard work. <cf>Did you find it, E-chan?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Was It Upside Down? <cf>That's why it was, that
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Let's see... Yes, it's the same as this one. <cf>I guess the engram is out after all.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Thank you <cf>It doesn't hurt like anything is broken.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Well then, I'm sorry, but <cf>could you please look for another E-chan?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I-chan is very curious, so <cf>I think she gets into strange places.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Behind the rocks, under the table, etc. <cf>Behind the tent... no, on top of the tent is hidden.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'll watch over E-chan here. <cf>It would be tiring if I felt woke up and went tired.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
If I can make the right hand, I might be able to get her back to the mansion on her own.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'm sorry, but thank you
\
Npc_Tini
Player
There should still be some Yi-chans in <cf>Salamzahd who has run out of engrams.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
On top of a tent, under a table, etc. <cf>I think they're in strange places, so please help me find them.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'll try to fix these here. <cf>I'm sorry, but thank you in advance.

Npc_Tini
Player
Hinofu only... huh? <cf>What else happened to be missing?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Ah, that's her! <cf>Adventurer, did you see her in the water?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I have a cat called Ee who loves to get in the water. <cf>Of course, she can't swim, so she sinks.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
... The First One You Saw Fell into the Water and Was Somewhere Away? <cf>Ah, that's it. No worries about it.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Relieve me, but could you please retrieve the last one?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I can't just sink it in the oasis. <cf>I'm so excited now.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I think there is one more Ee-chan left, so <cf>could you please retrieve it for me?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
She can't swim but she loves to get in the water, so I think she's submerged in the oasis.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I have to wipe off the water, it's so tiring <cf>No, maybe it will dry if I leave it alone?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I found Yi at the bottom of the oasis. <cf>He feels a bit tired.
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
Collect it and deliver it to Tini
\
Npc_information
Npc_information
Oh, adventurer. <cf>Have you found the last Yi-chan?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Oh my, I'm tired tired!
\
Npc_Tini
Player
So you were submerged in the oasis after all? <cf>You're so dynamic and at your own pace
\
Npc_Tini
Player
I'm sure this girl will be a big star in the future. <cf>But I hope she won't become one in a place that has nothing to do with me.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Thank you, thank you <cf>This is all I need.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Ah, I was tired. I was sweaty covered in sweat. <cf>I also felt like taking a bath in the oasis.
\
Npc_Tini
Player
Well then, I guess I'll go home. <cf>By the way, E-chan is incredibly big, isn't she?
\
Npc_Tini
Player
How should I get it home... <cf>Oh, come on. Just thinking about it makes me feel excited.
\
Npc_Tini

By the way, isn't it too hot in this city?

Oh, adventurer. Welcome
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
I've opened the brand shop I've been longing for. I'm indebted to the <cf>adventurer
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Thanks to that, the shop is doing well. <cf>But I'm still not going to be satisfied
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Our goal is to become the best brand in the world! <cf>To that end, we still have to raise our name recognition
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
<cf>So what caught my eye was the fashion contest that will be held this time
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
It's called the “Tolima Awards.” Is it a contest hosted by <cf>a certain baron
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
It's also famous as a gateway to success for new designers. There are <cf>many brands that won the championship and made a name for themselves all at once
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
So, this time I'm going to win the Grand Prix!
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Of course, winning the championship isn't easy. I have to <cf>make the best dress and try it out!
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
That's why they stayed in a relationship until the dress was completed
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
The image is mostly solid. It incorporates the <cf>Barnhardt style to infer an exotic atmosphere
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
I want you to gather the materials you need for the dress. <cf>I wanted to stick to Barnhardt products over there too
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
First, the “pink coral fossil” where elegant dyes can be harvested. You should be able to <cf><value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>collect it with “”
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Then, “hult cotton,” which is supple, high-grade cotton. <cf>Collect this one with “” <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/>
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Actually, I'm worried about the final deciding factor... <cf>Anyway, please bring me those two first
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Once you actually see the material, you'll be inspired! Please <cf>also ask for good materials for inspiration!
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
First, gather two materials. <cf>Both can be found on the West Barnhart Peninsula
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
<cf>You can find “pink coral fossils” by collecting minerals in “” <value type="locationName" id="fld005_W"/>
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
“Hult Cotton” is “”. <value type="locationName" id="fld005_C"/> You should be able to get this by <cf>collecting plants
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Because you can find something of good quality. <cf>I'm looking forward to it!
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Thank you for your hard work! <cf>You've collected materials, haven't you
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Yes, it's a nice “pink coral fossil”! <cf>It's pink more beautiful than I thought
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
“Haruto Cotton” is also the best! <cf>It's soft and feels like it washes your heart
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
That's good. It's so good! <cf>It came, it came, it inspired me!
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
I came up with an idea, the final deciding factor! <cf>Let's use “Large Spholite”
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
Spholite is a stone often used for accessories. <cf>The bright red glow is so beautiful
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
<cf>However, if the stone is too big, the color will be strong and difficult to use
B
Npc_Tiely
Player
But if it's my dress, I can make the most of it for you! You can get a <cf>one-of-a-kind sparkle!
B

Thank you for asking for the request. <cf>I am the manager of this oasis.

Npc_Mold

It feels like a monster. <cf>It's before it's done.

At that time, the monster's bodily body mixed with the water and shampoo quite a <cf>commotion.

We've been making various hangout spots here and there. <cf>Coin Tei is one of them.

There are monsters wandering around and it seems like you can't get in.

It's a secret hideout, so I don't want to make a big fuss about it.

So we're looking for adventurers and want to hire them to dangerous monsters.

The goal is to be rejected accepted into the Barnhardt Knights! <cf>With your country's problems, the problem is solved!

In order for it to be used by the Barnhardt Knights, it must be possible to use it for Machina as well.

Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>It's not [oral tradition (kuden)] or vague folklore, it's a record that remains in writing
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>It would be ruined if the story was forgotten or misconveyed
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>Besides, it should also be useful for our children and grandchildren to look up old history
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
Right now, I'm having a hard time searching like this... I want to write it down in <cf>a proper form
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
So, I also wanted the adventurer to help
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>What I'm looking into right now is a story about a thief escaping into a cave
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>The vicious thief is trying to get away with his pursuers in the depths of a cave where no one comes
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
After a while, they jump out of the cave
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
The people who were chasing the thieves were amazed. In <cf>just a few days, he looked like a thin, frail old man
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
Then, I changed my mind as if people had changed. <cf>It is said that he confessed his sins and was quietly caught
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>It's one of the easy-to-understand legends that “the bad guys always get punished,” isn't it
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
The problem is the cave. <cf>It's a story handed down around here, but I have no idea where it is
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
Of course, it's also unclear what happened to the thief
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
So, I looked up a lot of other stories. <cf>I think “[Wadatsumi no Iwaya (Wadatsumi no Iwaya)]” might be this cave
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>“[Wadatsumi no Iwaya (Wadatsumi no Iwaya)]” has long been an object of worship for people in this area, and it has appeared in various stories
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>Instead, it's not clear what kind of place it is
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>I'd like to take a look, but it's a sacred place and it seems dangerous for us to get close
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
I want them to go to the site and look it up. <cf>“[Kaijin Caves (Wadatsumi no Iwaya)] · Additional Investigations”, please
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>I want them to do “[Wadatsumi no Iwaya (Wadatsumi no Iwaya)]: Additional Investigations” and take a look at what's inside
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>It's a place that appears in many stories, but I've never been in
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>I'd be happy if I could find a clue about what happened to the thief
B

B
Npc_Oemalulu

I'll take notes, so let me listen to it right away
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
... hmm hmm... ho ho...
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>I've heard rumors, but there really are ruins in Bavaria
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>Furthermore, the inside is full of ocean water, and monsters also appear...
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
yeah. <cf>I feel like it's similar to the cave in the story of The Thief
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>I wonder if the reason the thieves escaped from the cave was because they were attacked by monsters after all?
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>It was so horrible that he changed like an old man
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>If the ruins of Bavaria are also involved, no matter what happens, it's no wonder
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
Thank you so much. Progress has been made thanks to <cf>Adventurer
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>When it comes to investigating the ruins of Bavaria, to be honest, it's too much for me to get my hands on...
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>There's no doubt that it's a clue to folklore, so I'll keep a proper record of this too
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>That's because my descendants might look at this record and solve the real mystery
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>Also, if there's an interesting story, I'll tell the adventurer. That's it
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>People in the forest live a long time, so they tend to talk about everything in their own memory
B
Npc_Oemalulu
Player
<cf>The content of the story changes all the time depending on the person
B
Npc_Oemalulu

You wanted to be as active as ever, sir. <cf>You Were Even Getting A Lot of Attention at the Reclamation Bureau.
6

That's good, that's good. IT'S MAKE MY TRANSFORM POTION TOO Hehehe.
6
Npc_Layc

Strange, I need a strange material again. <cf>This can only be found at Cape Lawehara.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
The plant “Mizuhashirusou” can be found in the “Yukoku” of Tsukikakushi.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
I was lucky enough to get one the other day, but then I lost it
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Confidential, it was confiscated by the Bureau of Reclamation. <cf>That's Nasty, Hee Hee Hee
6
Npc_Layc
Player
'Water Running Grass' is not for sale, so <cf>the only way to collect it is to pick it up
6
Npc_Layc
Player
But I've been trying by the Reclamation Bureau, so I don't think I'll be able to get on the ship to Jubilia.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
So, it's your turn. <cf>Please deliver me about eight “Water Runners.”
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Oh, I won't do anything bad to you. <cf>You're the only one I can ask. Nice to meet you. hehehehehe
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Please deliver eight pieces of “Water Running Grass” found in the “Moon-Hidden Valley” at Cape Lawehara.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
If that didn't happen, <cf>I didn't have to worry about you.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Well, some days you're just aren't lucky. <cf>Well, I'm counting on you. Hehehehehe.

Oh, it's “Water Runner”! <cf>As expected, you work fast. Hehehe.

Thanks to you, I can now resume the motivation I need for the transformation drug. Thank you Hehehe.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Next time I'll have to be disappointed not to get caught by the Bureau of Reclamation. Hehehehehe.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Hmm? The story behind it being confiscated by the Bureau of Reclamation? <cf>Oh, come to think of it, I haven't told you that.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Just as its name, there is a legend that if used well, the “water running grass” can run on water.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Transform into what you transform into with the transformation potion, <cf>whether it floats in water is also important, right?
6
Npc_Layc
Player
I thought I'd try that first. <cf>But I don't really know how to do it.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
I thought I'd just put it all over my body and jump into the ocean.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
Then it affects that someone decides it. <cf>A GREEN MONSTER SHOOTS ON THE BEACH!
6
Npc_Layc
Player
So I was taken to the Reclamation Bureau and All My Water Runner Grass was confiscated. Hehehe.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
What, to make a transformation drug. <cf>It's only natural that there would be one or two such things.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
The compounding has progressed quite well. <cf>I think I'll be happy on you until the end of death.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
I'll be counting on you again next time. hehehehehe...
6
Npc_Layc
Player
It would be bad to make the Reclamation Bureau my enemy, so I'll ask for a little leniency. Hehehe.
6
Npc_Layc
Player
I'm still just a compounder. <cf>I'll make some medicine and deliver it to you.

No, that's for my own clothes. <cf>I was in no position to lose.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
Sorry for the sad story. <cf>I don't need help from others...
8
Npc_Blandel

I got so excited in my work that I ended up sleeping through my day off.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
I had plans to go out with my family, but I wanted it.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
My wife and children are very tired, and <cf>everyone says [“I don't mind”]
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
That's what's wrong of what I'm excited... <cf>It would be sad if you just got angry.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
No, let's not do that. <cf>All of this is what I swear myself.
8
Npc_Blandel

Desire, I want to relax to my family. <cf>But, as you know, I'm not good at being myself.
8
Npc_Blandel

The ONLY THINGS I CAN MOVE ARE MY HANDS. <cf>I thought I'd at least make something and give it to you as a present.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
I heard that Cape Lawehara has some cleansing materials and anecdotes.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
The material is “sea-glowing iron” that can be worn from “Ia More [Reef]”. <cf>It would be like to have five of them.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
Also, can you get 5 “Frost Shell Droplets” from Crab Spider Frost in “Ia More [Reef]”?
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
IT MAKES A HARD AND DURABLE METAL, SO <cf>IT IS SAID THAT PEOPLE USE IT TO MAKE GIFTS FOR THEIR LOVED ONES.

It strengthens a strong bond. <cf>It's a simple thing, but it's just right for me right now.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
It's a long journey to “Ia More”, but <cf>I wonder if you could ask me to go there. Thank you
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
Can you get me 5 each of “Sea Brilliant Steel” and “Frost Shell Droplets”?
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
Both can be found at the “Ia More” at Cape Lawehara.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
You Can Collect “Sea-Glowing Hard Iron” <cf>You Can Get “Frost Shell Droplets” by Defeating Crab Spider Frost.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
I'm sorry for leaving you into my affairs. <cf>I'm counting on you. Please take care of me.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
Oh, I've been waiting for this. <cf>I'm glad you managed to get the materials.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
This is the “Kaiki Hard Iron”. <cf>I see, it has a strange feel to it.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
It's a little different from the ore in Asteria Plain. <cf>It's also a lot harder.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
If you combine it with “Frost Shell Droplets,” it will be even more delicate.
8
Npc_Blandel
Player
I think I saw something like that in the records of old genres. <cf>Is there a hint at the manufacturing method from 400 years ago...?
8
Npc_Blandel

Oh no! I'm thinking about work again. <cf>That's not what I asked you to do.
8

I use this for my family. <cf>Yeah... the pot was starting to get excited.

P
Npc_Leggina

I didn't get excited, but I did get some recognition from the Knights.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
And then, you were able to get financial support for long-term development.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
I can finally relax! ... or so I thought.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Dad said ["I've wanted this for a long time!]” <cf>So he tried all these shampoo tools!

Well, are relaxation tools easy to use, right? <cf>I've always wanted to try them out myself...

So! <cf>We Have to Make New Armor Plates No Matter What!
P

P
Npc_Leggina

Don't look like it's just a tool! It feels my heart!!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
please! I need some help from Adventurers until I can make new armor plates.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
First, I'd like to try the ore that can be found at Shiomachihama on Cape Lawehara.
P
Npc_Leggina

P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Adventurer, collect five pieces of “Moonlight Iron Sand” <cf>You Can Collect Them in “Shiomachi Hama.”
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
To lose my family from going out and being torn apart! <cf>PLEASE LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH!!
P

Player
I Want You to Collect 5 pieces of “Moonlight Iron Sand” at “Shiomachi Beach” on Cape Lawehara.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
If We Don't Build and Deliver New Armor Plates, <cf>The Knights Financial Support Will Be Taken Away!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
There needed to be other materials needed too... <cf>First, please give me 5 pieces of 'Moonlight Iron Sand'!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Yay, it's “Moonlight Iron Sand”! <cf>Thank you very much, Adventurer!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Is this the kind of armor that is so strong that it can kill the fangs of any beast?
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
For now, I'll use my makeup to make it into the armor plate. Wait a moment!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Sorry to keep you waiting! <cf>Hmm, I guess it didn't end up being that amazing.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
It's not that strong, and it's not very flexible. <cf>It takes a lot of work, so it's not suitable for mass production.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
It might be possible for a large workshop brought by the knights, but a small blacksmith like ours can't handle it.
P

A stone called “Moon Spot”. <cf>It's small, but it's used in a variety of places...
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
<span size="Big">--That's it! That's it! </>
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
The “Moon Spots” are small and hard to notice! <cf>Combine them with “Moonlight Iron Sand”!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
The legend also says that the armor had a small dot struck in the moonlight. This is what the small dot was meant to.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Adventurer! One more time, please! <cf>Collect five “Moon Spots” in the “Valley of the Moon Hidden!”
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Now we can recreate the legend! <cf>It should work!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
I'm sorry that it seems out to be the same job. <cf>Please come to “Tsukikakushi no Yukoku” again.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
There is an ore called “Moon Spots” that can be visited, so I would like you to collect five of them.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
If we can recreate the legend now, we'll be able to recreate the Knights!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
“Moon Spots”! Thank you, Adventurer! <cf>I'm sorry I made you go twice
P
Npc_Leggina

I'll try it right away! <cf>Next time I'll get my dad to help me!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Yay! You did it, Adventurer!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
Using 'Moonlight Iron Sand' and 'Moon Spots' I was able to create an extremely strong armor plate!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
There are some technical essentials, but <cf>these facets of materials can be used to the knights.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
This will help you meet the requirements for funding and maybe even get some new funding!
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
I guess I'm sorry to my dad this time <cf>I got the idea from the legend of Cape Rawhehwara.
P
Npc_Leggina
Player
... No. It was Dad's fault that we were in such a pinch. <cf>I'll hold off on my thanks.
P
Npc_Leggina

But I'm excited to be the adventurers! <cf>It's All Thanks to the Adventurers Who Took Me Out

Ah, adventurer! Welcome back. <cf>Have you tried your hands on the Shiomachi clams?

Yay! <cf>This is the real “Shiomachi Asari”!
B
Npc_Melis

Okay, okay! If only I had this...

Now all that's left is for Rody to eat it, and maybe Melis' love will come true.

There Is A Legend That If You Feed Shiomachi Clams To The Person You Like, The Girl's Love Will Come True

After I told her about it, she told me to search for clams.
B
sq101_016_step0_npc_catrla

But clam chowder? <cf>That would require clams, so that's a great idea. Melis

I'll make some progress by feeding it to Rody, <cf>so he can make some progress!
B
Npc_Melis

I've made Clam Chowder, but what should I tell Roddy to try it?
B
Npc_Melis

[“] Eat It [”] Doesn't Have Much Impact, and <cf>[“] Eat It! [”] In a habitual tone is no good either...

Npc_Lasse
Npc_Lasse
Sweetheart, Elsie. <cf>It's a misunderstanding that bandits sleeping sheep.

Npc_Lasse
Npc_Erushi
Huh? What do you mean, brother?
a
Npc_Erushi
Npc_Lasse
Recently, I have been doing research on sheep, a type of shampoo. <cf>I desperately needed a desperate for that purpose.

Look, there is a gentle sheep nearby. <cf>A poor lamb kept and tamed by tired.

Even a clumsy guy like me could catch him right away. <cf>That's right! So it was me who fed the sheep!

They believe in my research! <cf>Hahahaha!

That's a figure of speech, or the <cf>truth is shown by actions, not words.

So it's the bandits after all!

Npc_Lasse
Npc_Erushi
You can't just sit at your desk and study. <cf>Eat meat and exercise every day!

It's good to have a job! <cf>Life is long, and it's not good to have too much free time.
A
Npc_Kainalulu

;
Well, most of my friends are laid back. <cf>That means some of the forest folk like to work too.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I'm Kainarul, the restorer of Bafaria's Legacy!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Is A Forest Folk Restorer rare, right? <cf>Even on a vast surprise, I'm going to be the only one.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I've always been taking things apart and leaving them back together.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I like new and exciting things. <cf>I don't dislike the customs of the forest, but I'm also leaving in the outside.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
So I throw a boat to Asterlies and throw as a restorer.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
And that's why I started my business here in Jubilia. <cf>I don't use the Bafaria heritage in my gardens.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
In That Respect, Jubilia is a Desperate Village, so <cf>restorer jobs come in all the time!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
The relaxation here is different from that of the Magna shampoo, which is relaxation. <cf>We don't have enough tools or materials needed for motivation, so we have to be creative...
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
... but this is no time for that kind of talk!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Stuck, I'm really busy right now! <cf>I have some work that is fast becoming its deadline, and to be honest, it's crazy!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Even in this shampoo, I've run out of materials. <cf>I'm too busy to go buy more.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
So, could you please get me some materials? <cf>You Should Be Able to Collect “Hekiri Stone” at “Shiomachi Beach”.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
It's an ore that can only be found around here. <cf>It Glows Brightly with the Power of the Engram
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
The lamp I'm tired is also a heritage lamp, so <cf>“Hekiri Stone” would like it would fit in nicely.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
How to restore using available materials. <cf>That's where the skill of a restorer comes into play...
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
So, this is no time for talking!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
“Hekiri Stone” can be found in “Shiomachi Beach”. <cf>For now, please collect eight of them!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I'll finish up some other work! <cf>Come on, get excited up and get to work!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Collect Eight “Hekiri Stones” at “Shiomachi Beach” on Cape Lawehara!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
At this rate I won't make the deadline! <cf>Help me please!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Oh, you loved the “Hekiri Stone”!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Oh, that was a big help! <cf>I just finished up some other work.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
We'll make it in time for the deadline. <cf>Now, let's finish the final moments!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
This is the luxurious heritage lamp. <cf>It looks like a very beautiful model.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
The internal structure is different from other lamps, so <cf>I started by resurrection how to repair it.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
It was hard to come up with “Hekiri Stone”. <cf>But this kind of trial and error is what makes the job fun!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Speaking of fun, this lamp. <cf>It does more than just provide light, you know?
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I don't know where it is, but the <cf>fate of another place is probably on the wall.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
If You Light This Lamp in a Dark Room, <cf>It Will Transform Into the Scenery of a Faraway Foreign Land!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
What an amazing legacy!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I'm curious about how it works, and where the curious is <cf>I'm also curious, it's curious!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Yes, speaking of interest. <cf>This guy comes to have come from Urlau.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Urulau is a desert of forest people, so the <cf>Bafaria heritage shouldn't be there.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
This is a heritage lamp that was once found in such a place. <cf>What's more, it comes with a mechanism that affects a foreign landscape!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Ahh, I'm curious!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
If you're an adventurer like you, <cf>maybe one day you'll solve the mystery.
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Thanks! If you find any relics that need repair<cf>, leave it to me!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Oh, a lot of restorations of heritage sites are restored in. <cf>That alone makes it fun!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
Disassemble, assemble, and think again... <cf>It's great because it's never boring!
A
Npc_Kainalulu
Player
I wonder if everyone did things like this during the time of the Bafaria civilization.

It May Not Go Along with the Forest People's Way of Thinking, but <cf>I Envy the People of the Past!

That's right. <cf>I'd like to drink something cold.
P
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
Tsk, that's a normal idea, Sia! <cf>Ideas are always hidden behind common sense.

P
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Oh, I'm not planning on selling it here, you know? <cf>I'll sell it in a cool place like Kanaloa, so don't worry!
P
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
What's more, it's a very popular futon among children. <cf>What do you think? It's a new approach, isn't it?
P
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Popular with kids? What's the logic behind that?
P
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
That's Mind Pecker!
P
Npc_Anne
Npc_Cya
Have you ever seen this, Adventurer? <cf>A bird-like monster with a silly face

THE FUTON I WAS IN A LOT FLUFFIER...
P
Npc_Anne
Player
The comfort used for down comforters are relaxing chest slippers from waterfowl.
P
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
It has high heat retention so that the body does not get cold from cold water, and it also has high heat release so that the fur does not get wet.
P
Npc_Cya
Npc_Anne
In the Thoughts of Birds That Live in Hot Thoughts, Everything is the Scissors
P
Npc_Cya

Then you can make the perfect super popular futon! <cf>Okay, let's go grab some!

Npc_Anne

My name is Mimi Olina. <cf>I serve God at Cape Lawehara.

I don't mean the God of Bafaria, but a different God that has been passed down in this land for a long time.
9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
It is called “Sea God (Wadatsumi)”. Cape Lawehara in ancient times was protected by this “Sea God (Wadatsumi)”.

9
Npc_Mimiolina

[Sea God (Wadatsumi)] also had a wild side. <cf>You see, the sea isn't always calm, is it?
9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
In the past, it was supposed to happen, and sea gods were seen by the wrath of the [sea god (Wadatsumi)].
9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
[Sea God (Wadatsumi)] protects this land, but <cf>he also protects it hardships and trials.
9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
At that time, the God of Baphalia and Calmed the Sea God (Wadatsumi) and his anger.
9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
It loved that the Sea God, Wadatsumi, left this land in the care of the God of Baphalia and loved to the other side of the sea.
9
Npc_Mimiolina

9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
IT IS SAID THAT A VILLAGE GIRL ASSED LIKE TO APPEACE THE WRATH OF THE SEA GOD.
9
Npc_Mimiolina
Player
Since then, we have been making feelings to [Sea God (Wadatsumi)]. <cf>So That Spice Will Never Be Repeated Again.

Npc_Mimiolina

From the Kahuna's point of view, it's a little sad that [Sea God (Wadatsumi)] has left...

sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Don't worry! Here we go!

sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
Damn! I have no choice!

Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Okay, good job! <cf>You complained but you complained up nicely.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
You're being honest, Joel. <cf>There might be some potential.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
Hey, give me a cooler job! <cf>If you're a knight, fighting is also part of your job.

Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Does this sound happen to you like? Klaus
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Oh, shut up! I'm sorry about that time.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
I can't leave it, but <cf>maybe we can send it on a recon mission?

sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Yeah, that's fine if you just watch it from afar.

sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Okay, kids! <cf>Next, we'll scout for monsters.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
Scouting is a mission, gathering all kinds of information and using your brain. <cf>Would you like to show us that you're not just good at fighting?
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
! Of course! <cf>I'll scout it out for you!

Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
I told you so? <cf>Then let's race to 'Ia More!

Hey, don't go ahead! <cf>Don't go near the monsters!

sq101_021_start_npc_crouse

Will You Also Come to “Ia More”? <cf>If the monsters target us, we won't be able to handle them.

Oh, wow... <cf>There are so many monsters!

Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Hey, calm down. It's okay. <cf>If you stay here, they won't attack you.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
That was a bit busy. <cf>I found the target of my reconnaissance, Gilmy.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Player
There are more of them than teenagers. <cf>It's too dangerous to go near them with children.

If it were just us it would be OK, but <cf>I can't let this kid get in any danger.

Oh, forget about me, <cf>just get it over with!

Shut up, think sorry! <cf>There's No Way We Can Win Unarmed!

sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
The work of the knights is dangerous! <cf>The Golden Rule is to act with safety first!
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
If I were to hurt you, it would be a disgrace to the order. <cf>You wanted that, right?
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
Uh, yeah. Got it...
?
Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
We'll take the kid back. <cf>In the shower, can you throw Gilmy?
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
If You Can Attract Them, <cf>We Can Escape Attracting With Our Kids.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
I'm sorry for making you go through this again. <cf>I'll feel as much as I want later.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
It's not just Klaus. <cf>Let me bow my head too.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Player
Sweetheart, let's throw Joel's joke. <cf>We're back in Jubilia.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Player
Let me join you in Jubilia! <cf>You're strong enough, I'm counting on you!
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
This kid's safety is our top priority. <cf>We're taking him and praising to Jubilia.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
You attract the Gilmy and attract their attention.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
I'm sorry for always bothering you. <cf>Please, I Beg You!
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
Good job! <cf>You loved Guilmy.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
You're amazing! <cf>You're still in good health even after all that fighting.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Player
The Knights are flying adventurers to flying them. <cf>Are The Knights proud, right?
?
Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Klaus has messed with monsters before and run away.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
That's when this Adventurer presents me.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
Oh, what a shameful memory. <cf>But it's true, so there's nothing I can do about it.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
So, are Adventurers more amazing than knights?
?
Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
No, that's not true. <cf>Everyone has their own role to play.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
We did our part to protect you from danger. <cf>We believe, and the Adventurer show.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
It's not about who's better. <cf>Well, FIGHTING MIGHT BE COOLER TOUCH.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
I Want You to See Not “The Strong Knights” but <cf>“The Way of Life of the Knights”
?
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
Npc_Joel
The Way of Life of the Knights...
?
Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_lucas
You ran away from home, didn't you? <cf>First, talk to your mom and dad.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
I Also Ran Away from Home and Other Desperate Things, but <cf>Nothing Good Came Out of It.
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
Kid... no, Joel the Traveler. <cf>Your first task is to talk to your parents!
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
If you can't do that, you can't call yourself Joel of the Knights! ha ha ha!
?
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
Wh, what?! <cf>I get it! I'll talk to you about it!
?
Npc_Joel
sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
If Mom and Dad say it's OK, <cf>I'll work for the Knights with you guys!

sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Yeah, that's great! Come anytime!

sq101_021_start_npc_crouse
Npc_Joel
Well, it looks like it's been sorted out clothes. <cf>Thank you for your help too.

sq101_021_start_npc_lucas

It seems that Klaus has also become aware of his role as a knight. <cf>IT'S ALL THANKS TO MEETING YOU.

sq101_021_start_npc_lucas

Please help us and many other people. <cf>Good luck on your journey!

Ah, come on! shut up! <cf>You come here every day without getting a board.

Oh, my dear Adventurer. <cf>I'm happy to see you again.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Thank you for your help. <cf>See, you disposed of the body, right?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
o
Did you meet Mr. Cosimo after that? <cf>I Haven't Seen Him Around Me Yesterday.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Ufufu. Don't look at me like that. <cf>What you three out was a 'pig's corpse'
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Or did you Imaginee something else?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Ufufu. Well, that's good to hear.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
There is something I would like to hate with you, Adventurer.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I'm having trouble because the goods I received from my friendly Blacksmith Haven't Had
u
Npc_Niki
Player
It's a small blacksmith in Kanaloa, and <cf>they forge fine blades.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Work is never delayed and <cf>it is a very reliable store.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I'd like to go and have a look at it once, but <cf>it would be dangerous for a child to go alone, right?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
We May Need to Ask for Your Help as an Adventurer. Would You Mind Relish Us?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Adventurer, You Won't Just Leave A Child In Trouble, Right?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Of course, if there was nothing, that would be best. <cf>Ufufu. Thank you very much.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
<cf>The Goods Haven't Said From The Blacksmith in Kanaloa, so I'm a little teenager.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I'd like to go and have a look, <cf>so could you come with me?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
If you had any trouble, <cf>we would like to ask for your help as an adventurer.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Thank you very much.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Hey, welcome, adventurer!
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
... I would like to say that, but I'm sorry. <cf>We are not taking any new orders at the moment.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
It's been a while, boss. <cf>Thank you for your relaxation support.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Oh? It's Niki-chan. <cf>Did you come all the way from Asterlies?
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
YES I thought it was wrong for the boss to delay the delivery so much.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
I was tired if something had happened.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Thank you for that. <cf>I'm happy you patronize a humble workshop like ours.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
But I'm sorry. I'm having some trouble and I can't make makeup shampoo products.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
Did something happen?
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
The warehouse was furnished by Proto Machina. <cf>All of our blacksmithing tools were taken away.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
I've been using it for many years and it's becoming someone to my hands. <cf>The QUALITY OF THE ALTERNATIVE TOOLS is recommended
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
I'm leaving out various things, but <cf>it's still far from being something I can serve to customers.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
Did Proto Machina invent your master's tools?
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
You Didn't Pay Any Attention to Anything Else, Just the Tools of the Smith?
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Ah, I still had the materials left. <cf>So I can do something about the blacksmithing jokes.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
I'm in trouble. <cf>If this closing up, I'll have to think about closing down my business.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
There's no need to rush to that trouble. <cf>There's no need to worry if it's the master's skill.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Expectations, if I get my tools back, <cf>there's no problem, right?
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
There are some reliable adventurers here, so <cf>I'll give them a little advice.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Yes, I thought that, but... <cf>The Other Party is Proto Machina.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
Adventurers are one thing, but <cf>Niki-chan is just a child. Don't be reckless.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
I know. <cf>I'll just do what I do best.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Adventurer. <cf>Would you like to talk a bit over there?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Once I get my blacksmithing tools back, <cf>I can go back to business as teenagers.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
The One Who Stole the Tools was Proto Machina. <cf>It's not something an amateur could do.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Adventurer, please give Niki some advice. <cf>It feels like there's something we need to talk about.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Don't be too reckless. <cf>Niki is still a child after all.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Well, adventurer. <cf>I've heard some serious news.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Protomachina May Attack People <cf>However, they won't be inappropriate people's tools.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Doing so would not be of any benefit to Protomachina.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
However, if there is a business rival of the boss, <cf>he will benefit greatly.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Did you know that the Barnhardt Knights use Machina as a fighting force?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
That's because they have the Technology to Control Machina. <cf>Of Course, It's A Military Secret, So It Can't Be Used By Outsiders.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
However, no matter what secret it is, it will be repeated if it is strange.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
For example, if someone who was part of the knights order <cf>disowned owners and rejected a bandit...
u
Npc_Niki
Player
You May Be Able to Control Makina and Proto Makina <cf>
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Of course, these are just my speculations. <cf>I have no proof.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
So I'll look into that. <cf>I'm thinking of thinking of the adventurer for Protomachina.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I just had a look at my boss's warehouse. <cf>[PM (Protomachina)] There Were Traces of Mook.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
It explains that a [PM (Proto Machina)] Mook in “Miasma Mine - Free Exploration” has stolen the master's tools.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Adventurer, could you explore the [PM (Proto Machina)] Mook in “Miasma Exploration Mine - Free Exploration”?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
That should get your master's tools back.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I'll lose myself for a moment. <cf>I have something in mind about “relaxation”
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I'm going to talk to you for a bit. <cf>Please tell the boss when you're done.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
It explains that the [PM (Proto Machina)] Mook in “Miasma Mine - Free Exploration” has stolen your master's tools.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Adventurer, could you help me hate the monster? <cf>I think we can get my master's tools back.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I'll try to find another place. <cf>I'd like to talk to you a bit.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
[PM (Protomachina)] After Defeating Mook, <cf>Please Tell Your Boss So He Can Relax.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Oh, adventurer. <cf>What's long?
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
These are my smithing tools! <cf>Have you got them back?
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Thanks for the help! <cf>But where did you find it?
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Eh? Niki-chan told you to go and imagine Proto Machina?
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
That was a lot of trouble. <cf>Niki-chan is always present for crazy things.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
But what if they come again? <cf>Even if we make the warehouse relaxation, there's a limit to how much we can do...
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Don't worry about that.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Thank you for your hard work, Adventurer. <cf>I See You've Taken Care of Proto Machina.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Master, there will be no more monsters and no more things to hinder your business.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Please feel free to focus on your work.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Is that so? <cf>That's a good thing, but...
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
Did Niki-chan do something?
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
No, it's all thanks to the Adventurers who fought Proto Machina.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
I don't care. As long as the boss does his job appear,
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
THE BLADES FORGED BY THE MASTER ARE FIRST CLASS PRODUCTS <cf>I look forward to delivering your next delivery.
u
Npc_Niki
Npc_Craftsman
Yes, I get it! <cf>I got my tools back, let's get back to work.
u
Npc_Craftsman
Npc_Niki
Thank you, Adventurer! <cf>If you need any blacksmithing help, let me know!
u
Npc_Craftsman
Player
Thanks to you, the problem has been solved. <cf>Thank you, Adventurer.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
If nothing had been lost, Protomachina would have been left alone.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
It was tired because tired were tired. <cf>Of Course, It's Not The Adventurer's Fault
u
Npc_Niki
Player
<cf>Desperate is Far More Desperate than Monsters or the Bafaria Legacy. Don't you think so?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
However, those who had been leaving behind the scenes <cf>have never come out into the open.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
It went that the boss's work was an eyesore, but <cf>he went a little too far.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Ufufu. You have such a scary face... <cf>You're a sleeping person, adventurer.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
It's as if they're afraid that I'm even more terrifying than the terrifying things...
u
Npc_Niki
Player
I just needed my boss's work. <cf>I don't want to lose to get in my way.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Tools that fit your hands are shampoo for your work. <cf>Your boss said the same thing, didn't he?
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Taken to take that away from people is not a very good thing.
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Adventurers, please be willing. <cf>Please take good care of yourself and your gear, ufufu
u
Npc_Niki
Player
Well then, see you later. <cf>Good day, kind adventurer.

Well, let's go and retrieve it seems! <cf>Let's meet up in Jubilia first.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Maybe I'll clear out the monsters I hate. <cf>I'll talk about that when I get to Jubilia.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
My Men Are On An Expedition to Shiomachi Beach at Cape Lawehara
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
It looks like there are no supplies either, <cf>I guess it'd be best to have them tired.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Let's go to Jubilia for now. <cf>We'll think about what to do next there.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Hey, good job! <cf>I found My Men Training for the Expedition.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
He was a teenager. <cf>I've tried him and let him rest for now.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Well, it feels good without eating or drinking. <cf>It's okay to leave him a little.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
It helped that thanks to them driving away the monsters, the villagers were saved.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Recently, there has been a strange incident in the number of two types of monsters, the Swamp Lizard and the Ignis Lizard.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
It Overlapped with the Expedition Training, So <cf>It Took Them Both Faced Off at the Same Time.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
I didn't let them get close to the village, but <cf>I couldn't wipe them out.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
I wanted to take care of the rest, but <cf>I couldn't cover it all by myself.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Sorry. I'd like to ask you for a favor.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Can you imagine 10 Swamp Lizards and 10 Ignis Lizards in Shiomachi Hama?
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
While, I'll destroy their nest. <cf>Leave that to me. Sorry, but I'll be counting on you!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
If we wear the guards like this, <cf>Jubilia may damage.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
I HAVE TO CLEAN UP AFTER MY PERSONATES. <cf>Sorry, but could you help me out?
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
I'm excited you to lose 10 Swamp Lizards and 10 Ignis Lizards.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
The Ones That Remains in “Shiomachi Hama” are fine. <cf>In the worst, I'll go and destroy the nest!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Thank you for wanting me out... <cf>You came, Captain...
S
Npc_Security_Guard_01
Player
Ah, even supplies... <cf>The Captain is the best after all...
S
Npc_Security_Guard_01
Player
I can't move because...
S
Npc_Security_Guard_02
Player
I'm hungry...
S
Npc_Security_Guard_02
Player
Hey, you! <cf>Thanks for kicking those lizards away!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
I chose the nest too. <cf>Thanks to you, it was a breeze
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Jubilia can relax now. <cf>I told everyone it was your favorite!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Now, let's take my men home. <cf>I'll feed them on the liner.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
This time I really changed my mind. <cf>These guys are pretty good.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
There's still plenty of training to be done, and the more you do it, the relaxation you'll get!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
All the right! I won't let you swim home, but there are plenty of training you can do on the boat!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Get a good night's sleep tonight, guys! <cf>I'll be more excited starting tomorrow!
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Hey, it's you! <cf>Jubilia was also in your care.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
The expedition training session to have been a good experience. <cf>My Disciplets Have Become More Attractive.
S
Npc_Eubank
Player
Maybe it's time to throw it out into the desert. <cf>If it's okay on the beach, it should be fine!

it's suspicious. that's suspicious, those two. <cf>It's really suspicious
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>If we meet face to face, it's just a matter of fighting, but every time we run errands, for some reason, we meet
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
?
If you really don't like it, you probably won't meet them in the first place. <cf>I mean... maybe, maybe?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
The captain asked me to procure materials, now
?
Npc_Soldier
Player
“Overweight steel plate”? it's <cf>not something you can get right away, is it
?
Npc_Soldier
Player
Why don't you talk to the Bavarian Order? There's a cooperative relationship between the <cf>Knights and the Order
?
Npc_Soldier
Player
It would be nice if there was a surplus over there, but...
?
Npc_Soldier
Player
<cf>My senior priest asked me to procure materials
?
Npc_Priest
Player
<cf>It's an “overweight steel plate,” but it's not something you can get right away, is it
?
Npc_Priest
Player
It can't be helped. Would you like to talk to the Knights? <cf>There are also many cases where supplies are exchanged between people
?
Npc_Priest
Player
It would be nice if there was a surplus over there...
?
Npc_Priest
Player
Everyone, adventurers. <cf>If you like it, can't you ask for something?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>It's about our Captain Wilmer and Anelma, the Priest of Bavaria
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
It's suspicious, these two people. <cf>It's really suspicious
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>If you let them meet face to face, even though there are only fights, it's like everyone is aware of something!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I'd like to confirm the truth of this, so could you cooperate a little bit?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
thank you so much. <cf>Maybe it's Adventurer's turn
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I'm on good terms not only with Captain Wilmer, but also with Anelma
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I mean they're both hardheaded, or they don't know how to give in to their partner
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>Every time we meet, we get into a fight, so we're caught in between every time, aren't we?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
BUT, BUT. <cf>Aren't they saying that the more we fight, the closer we are?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Captain Wilmer, who is struggling, is also inwardly... I don't think Anelma, <cf>who is super cool and cold, is serious...!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
If that were the case, wouldn't you think it would be interesting!?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>When I was thinking about something like that, they each got called by the two
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>It's just right, and I thought I'd focus on my errands and start exploring
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
For now, are you going from Captain Wilmer
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>They're supposed to be patrolling around Barnhart Castle, so I think they can find it somewhere
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I can tell you troublesome errands anyway, and let's clean up the ones you don't like first
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>Captain Wilmer and Anelma say it's definitely suspicious!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>They've just been called by 2 people, so let's start exploring while running errands
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Let's start with Captain Wilmer. It must be <cf>inside Barnhardt Castle
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Oh, it's finally here, Cherni. <cf>Why is the Adventurer with you
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
You always took care of me, Adventurer. <cf>My subordinates are bothering you anyway, but please take care
?
Npc_Wilmar
Player
No, no, that's how to say it. <cf>Isn't it okay to lift your subordinates a little more, Captain
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
That's right, Cherni. I have <cf>something I want to ask you right away
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
I don't like it
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
Get me an “overweight steel plate.” It would be nice if you carried it to the <cf>castle
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>[PM (Proto-Machina)] If you defeat Dogorman type beta, you should be able to get it
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
I just don't know where they are. <cf>I'm sorry, but I ordered it from a search place
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
No, you're not listening at all, are you!? <cf>Why is it assumed that it will be accepted
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
What's more, an “overweight steel plate”! <cf>Oh, it's insanely heavy, isn't it!?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
that's why they invited you, right? <cf>Right now, you're the only one with free hands in the unit
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>Asking the Adventurer for help beforehand would be fine for you
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
After all, they imposed trouble, didn't they? <cf>After this, even though Anelma also invited
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
it's <span size="Big">a-ne-le-ma~~? </>
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
ah, that's dangerous. I gave out my name
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
Hey, Cherni! <cf>that's not why she blew something into it!
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
That's because he has nothing to do with this! <cf>I'm not saying anything superfluous!
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
Hurry up and collect the “Overweight Steel Plates”! <cf>This is an order from the captain, understand!!
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
I know, I understand! <cf>It's an “overweight steel plate”, yes yes!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
Huh, that's enough. <cf>Just hearing Anelma's name makes me feel like that
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
I've also taken on the “overweight steel plate” case. <cf>As always, it's tyrannical. Captain, tyrannical!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
it can't be helped. <cf>Let's go listen to Anelma's errands
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>It was a story about coming to the castle, so I think they are nearby
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>Assuming that the “overweight steel plate” requested by the captain will be collected later
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Let's go listen to what Anelma is doing. It seems they<cf>'ve come to the castle, so I think they'll find it soon
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Thank you very much for your hard work. <cf>Cherni and Adventurer too
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
Everyone, Anelma. <cf>I was invited and came to visit~
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
<cf>The captain has forced me to do troublesome things, and Anelma's errands are also quickly cleaned up ~
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
Mr. Wilmer? <cf>Aren't you starting to ask unreasonable and difficult questions again
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>I can see that person's high-pressure attitude towards Mr. Cherni on a daily basis. It should be changed
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>If it seems difficult for Mr. Cherni to refuse, I will go along with him, albeit with little effort
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>Wow, Anelma is the only person who is on my side like that! so kind!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
<cf>... I'm starting to feel like it would be a waste to the captain
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
<cf>It's heartbreaking under such circumstances, but could you please listen to my request
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>I would like you to collect a material called “overweight steel plate”
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
huh? Is Anelma also an “overweight steel plate”?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
Yes, I've heard that there are people who need it. <cf>No surpluses were found in the religious community
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>I know that it can be found in “Abandoned Mine of Miasma: Free Exploration” on the “Stahl Coast”
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>It wasn't that clear what kind of monsters to defeat
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
Maybe it's [PM (Proto-Machina)] Dogolman beta type. <cf>I was told such a story
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
Is it left-sided? So, could you ask for an <cf>“overweight steel plate”?
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
Please bring about 5 to the castle. <cf>I'm also going to ask for the merchant's [tentome (tsune)], etc. Well then
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
Hmm, two people ask for the same thing. <cf>There are coincidences like that
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>However, the [PM (Proto-Machina)] Dogolman beta from “Miasma Abandoned Mine: Free Exploration” is a troublesome opponent
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
I think I'm glad I asked the Adventurer. <cf>I'm sorry, but please go out with me
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Defeat <cf>[PM (Proto-Machina)] de Golman Beta in “Abandoned Mine and Free Exploration” by “Stahl Coast” and obtain 5 “Overweight Steel Plates”
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Let's go back to Barnhart Castle when we're done. <cf>Well then, it's time to start the mission!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Defeat <cf>[PM (Proto-Machina)] de Golman Beta in “Abandoned Mine and Free Exploration” by “Stahl Coast” and obtain 5 “Overweight Steel Plates”
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Once you're done, head back to Barnhart Castle
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I'm sorry to have gone out with you so much, but thank you for your support
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Huh, huh... well, adventurer... Thank you for <cf>collecting “Overweight Steel Plates”...
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Hmm, I can't do that anymore! <cf>Why does something so stupid and heavy have to be carried by human power!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Excuse me! A military research institute has confirmed <cf>“overweight steel plates”
?
Npc_Soldier
Npc_Schelnie
research institute? <cf>Oh, maybe everyone at the research institute was looking for “overweight steel plates”?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Soldier
yes <cf>It suddenly became necessary, but there were no reserves left at the research center
?
Npc_Soldier
Npc_Schelnie
<cf>I was requesting procurement from the Knights Barnhardt and the Bavarian Order, respectively
?
Npc_Soldier
Npc_Schelnie
1, 2, 3, 4, 5... <cf>It's exactly 5 cards, isn't it? confirmed
?
Npc_Soldier
Npc_Schelnie
Well, we'll go back and collect it later. <cf>Thank you so much for your help!
?
Npc_Soldier
Npc_Schelnie
I see, that's what it is. Requests were made to both the <cf>Knights and the Order
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>So, Captain Wilmer and Anelma both wanted to prepare an “overweight steel plate”
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
oh, cherni. Adventurer too. <cf>Thank you for your hard work
?
Npc_Wilmar
Player
Thank you very much. Thank you for your hard work, <cf>Cherni and the Adventurer
?
Npc_Anelma
Player
I mean, you! Anelma! <cf>why are they in a place like this!?
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Anelma
Why is Mr. Wilmer here?
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Wilmar
<cf>Captain and Anelma were both talking about wanting an “overweight steel plate.”
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
So, I got help from an adventurer and got them ready. Someone from <cf>the research institute just came to check
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
<cf>More than that, for me, there's one thing I'm worried about!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
<cf>That's not why Captain and Anelma were directly requested by the research institute, right?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
<cf>I think it's a little bit caught in my ear, so why did you go out of your way to ask me to do it?
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Wilmar
I heard this guy was in trouble
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
I heard that Mr. Wilmer was in trouble
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Schelnie
wow! whooh~? whoooo! There are <cf>also strange things!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
<cf>I heard that they wanted it for each other, so I tried to prepare it for each other!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
What's more, keep it a secret without telling the other person!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
Isn't it safe to say this is a present? <cf>Hey hey, hey hey!
?
Npc_Schelnie
Npc_Anelma
Wow, what, that grinning face! <cf>It's just a procurement mission, nothing more!
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Schelnie
First of all, Anelma! Why did you ask Cherni! <cf>You can probably just tell me about procuring materials, etc.!
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Anelma
<cf>There is no choice but to ask Willmar for what Willmer is looking for
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Wilmar
<cf>“Overweight steel plates” will be collected, so please bring them with Mr. Wilmer
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Wilmar
I don't need it! <cf>I needed you, so take it with you!
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Anelma
I heard Mr. Wilmer was looking for it. <cf>I'm not happy even if I get it from you
?
Npc_Anelma
Npc_Wilmar
<span size="Big">what... and... wow!? </>
?
Npc_Wilmar
Npc_Anelma
well, it's started. <cf>Really, no matter how many times you fight, you won't get tired of it
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
Thank you, adventurers, too. I'm sorry I asked for <cf>so many things
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
As for me, I'm very satisfied! The number of stories that <cf>make fun of the captain has also increased, and uhihi
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
OK, I wonder how I'll get the two involved next. <cf>that's because I'm not being honest at all, I smirk
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I think Captain and Anelma are a good match
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
<cf>I wonder if I'm not being honest even though I'm worried about each other, it really looks just like
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
I wonder how I'm going to stick them together! <cf>This isn't my mission anymore! smirk
?
Npc_Schelnie
Player
[PATH]477*\SQ\Chapter05\SQ105_039.uasset[PATH]
Um, um! <cf>Could you tell me the way?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I want to go to Jubilia across the sea. <cf>So, I chose to head for the sea first.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
?
If there's a lot of water, it's the ocean, right?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
IT'S OKAY, THE OCEAN IS SO WIDE! <cf>There's No Way I'll Get Lost
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
thank you! I won't get lost this time!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
The sea is the sea, but there is no port or dock. <cf>I ran the cliffs...
?
Npc_information
Npc_information
He may be lost. <cf>If you see him talking, please say hello.
?
Npc_information
Npc_information

Npc_information
Npc_information
Hey, do you know the lost adventurer named Pisarii?
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
If you knew, could you help me out? <cf>As tired, I don't know where he went.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
That child has trouble me a lot, so <cf>I want to help him if he's in trouble.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Thank you for taking on this. <cf>Hmm? Do you know Pissarri?
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Have you lost a few times? Ha <cf>ha ha, same as always!
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Pisarii is an excellent adventurer. <cf>There are many people who have been leaving by her.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
When someone is in trouble, he is leaving out of nowhere and leaving them.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I'm tired in the middle of getting lost
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I have given directions and received help from you on a few suggestions. <cf>I was thinking of returning the favor someday.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
It's just a rumor that Pisarii wanted to do something and is wandering around here and there.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Sorry for bothering you, but <cf>can you help that girl out?
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Thank you Just finding Pissarri <cf>is going to be pretty tough...
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
<cf>It loved that the farmhouse in Minsterhorn was recently taken care of by Pissarri.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Listen to the story and follow his steps. <cf>I'd help Pisarii if you could help Pisarii.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Thank you I'll Pray for the Protection of the God of Bafaria for You and Pisarii.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
The Farmer in Minsterhorn might know where Pissarri is.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Listen to the story and follow my steps
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
If you find Pissarri, please help him. <cf>It feels like he has something he wants to do.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
I ask you May the God of Baphalia's blessings be upon you.
?
Npc_Panayoti
Player
Hey Adventurer <cf>Is there something I can help you with in my field?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Oh, you mean Mr. Pisarii? <cf>Yes, you wanted me the other day.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
My son is a budding adventurer. <cf>He slipped while lying “The Claw Marks of the Giant Dragon.”
?
Npc_Villager
Player
When he was possessed by vicious monsters, <cf>Pissarri believed to be possessed by.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
And so, he killed the monster in no time and saved his son.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It was in the middle of a bush where no one would ever come, so my son was present.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I wanted to thank you, but you left early, sorry <cf>[“] I have something I want to do [”]
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I don't know where you're going... <cf>You might not be there when you go there.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
Oh, that's right. I left a gift for Pisarii at the Asterlies Reclamation Bureau.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It may have a very good time. <cf>Why not ask someone at the Bureau of Reclamation?
?
Npc_Villager
Player
I have left a gift for Pissarri at the Asterlies Reclamation Bureau.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
It may have fun. <cf>If not, you may be asked by the person in question.
?
Npc_Villager
Player
If You Ask the Staff of the Reclamation Bureau, I Think You'll Be Able to Track Down Mr. Pisarii.

Thank you for your hard work, Adventurer. <cf>Thank You for Your Remembrance Remembrance with the Reclamation Bureau.

Player
Is there anything you would like to ask? <cf>Yes, what is it? I'll take care of it.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
... Pissari-san's footsteps? <cf>Hmm, I haven't seen you around recently.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
I have a lot of thank you letters and ungrateful rewards piling up, and <cf>I would like to see you.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Mr. Pisarii is the type of person who can't stay still when he sees someone in trouble.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
I can do anything, from fighting to gathering, crafting, and survival, and I can solve any problem.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Many people were tired, and the Reclamation Bureau also wanted to give an award to Mr. Pissari.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
I got lost and couldn't come to the award lost.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Umm, what's the latest news about Pisari-san...?
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Oh, I see you received a thank you note from the Kanaloa merchant. <cf>It says that pisarii-san tastes you some precious medicinal herbs.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
If you ask the merchant, you might be able to find out where Pissari is.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
what? You Showed the Newbie in “The Giant Dragon's Claw Marks”, and Then Took the Herbs to Kanaloa Right After That...?
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
What route would it take to get there in such a short time?
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
The person who met Mr. Pissari recently visited to be a merchant from Kanaloa.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
If you listen to the story, I think you will be able to get a sense of Mr. Pisari's footsteps.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
If possible, it would be better to be early it early.
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Once Pissarri - San Victory, even the search team from the Reclamation Bureau can't find him...
?
Npc_Female_Member
Player
Hello, welcome I'm excited to you, adventurer, for your help. I'll give you a bonus.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
I was tired by you just the other day. <cf>Your name is Pisarii-san.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
what? Are you looking for Mr. Pisarii? <cf>Oh, that's perfect!
?
Npc_merchant
Player
I also wanted to express my thoughts for your help. <cf>Please find it.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
The Other Day, When I Was In Trouble Because I Didn't Have Enough Restful Herbs, <cf>Pissarii-san Dishes to Be Delicate By.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
He chose to have a bunch of them with him, so he left them there.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
It's A Precious Scissors That Can Only Be Found On Cliffs Far From Human Remains, So It Really Feels Me Out
?
Npc_merchant
Player
... Indeed, how did they manage to collect such large herbs of fragrant herbs?
?
Npc_merchant
Player
THANKS, WITHOUT EVEN A MOMENT'S THANKS, I SAID, <cf>[“] THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT TO DO ["]
?
Npc_merchant
Player
I don't know the exact location, but the <cf>herb can be found near the desert.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
<cf>It explains that Mr. Pisarii is based in Salamzahd and is active in this field.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
It's a place where many people gather, so why not try looking for it in Salamzahd?
?
Npc_merchant
Player
Mr. Pisari may be based in Salamzahd.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
I'm sure there are many people who have seen you there and who has been seen by you.
?
Npc_merchant
Player
Salamzahd is far from here, but <cf>well, this is Pisari-san after all...
?
Npc_merchant
Player
Hey! Hey! Can you tell me the way?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I wanted to go to Jubilia but I got lost! <cf>I was heading for the sea but I can't find it anywhere!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
... Eh? Did you receive a request to help me? <cf>Were you lost that Panayote and the others were you lost?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I-I knew I was lost, but... <cf>I thought it would be OK this time!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Is Jubilia Across the Sea, Right? <cf>Then why not go to the sea?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
You Wouldn't Think You'd Get Lost Heading for the Sea, Would You?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I'm so lost, so... <cf>That's not very satisfying, yes...
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Okay then, let me try again! <cf>Please tell me the way to Jubilia!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
...
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
...?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
...? ?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
<span size="Big">... Huh, umm? ? ? </>
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I'm sorry! You loved it very clearly, but I still didn't get it!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Waah, I'm so stupid!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Kusun. You see, I want to give flowers to the people who want me out at Jubilia.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I know I'm a bit silly, but could you take me to Jubilia? Please
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I just want to get to get to Jubilia, but <cf>I feel like I'm taking a really long detour...
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I'm sorry Please take me, a fool, to Jubilia...
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
If I walk alone any relaxation, I'll be sorry about calling everyone and I'll be a nuisance...
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
We've got excited! Jubilee!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Wow, thank you! Thank you so much! <cf>It was so far away!!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I guess I just got lost and went too far, yes...
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
But now I think I can finally reach my goal.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I want to give flowers to a charming person. <cf>I want to go to “Ia More”
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
But I heard something bad. <cf>The Guilty Warlords are wreaking havoc around there.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I have my own goals, but the villagers are in trouble too, so <cf>I can't just leave them there!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Sorry for getting you tired! <cf>But I need your help too.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Let's split up and throw the Gilmy Warlord of “Ia More [The Reef]”!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
No, it's okay! I'll be within sight of you! <cf>I won't go here and there on my own!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
6 Guilty Warlords each! <cf>You and I would win, let's go!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I have a business in Ia More [the reef], but it matters that the Gilmy Warlords are in trouble.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
They're Dangerous for the Villagers, so let's drive them away!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Don't worry! I won't go off on my own! <cf>I can do it if it's just defeating defeat!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
You've Been the Guilmy Warlord! <cf>Thank you very much!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I also bought flowers. <cf>The sea was beautiful and calm, and I was happy.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
That person is a senior and an adventurer motivation I respect. <cf>When I was little, I was lost and he lost me.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I'm not a very strong person, or like Jake, I'm not a person who's risk to the top.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I did everything I could to help those in need.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
I've worked hard to become an adventurer like him.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
But he died before I could catch up with him
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
There are few Adventurers in the Adventurers City of Jubilia, so <cf>it seems he risks a risk to everyone protect from monsters.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
It helps to be that person. <cf>You could have had a waited a little joke.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
But I felt relieved after the flowers. <cf>I felt once again that I was born to become that person.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
what? Are there a lot of thank you notes to me at the Bureau of Reclamation? <cf>And are there other people to thank you?
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Fufu, that's good! <cf>It's crazy, but I'm doing my best.
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Okay, let's continue to do our best as adventurers! <cf>Even Getting Lost Can Be Done If You Try!
?
Npc_Pissarie
Player
Let's do it! Ooooh!!

<cf>When you get an order from the Bavarian Order, you're bound to get nervous
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>If you pay something you're not good at, it'll be like blasphemy against God
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
M
I get scolded even if I didn't mean to do that. <cf>Mistakes in religious orders are strictly prohibited
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>The sword was delivered by order from the guards of the Bavarian Order
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
it looks like it's for ceremonial purposes. It's <cf>a fine sword with beautiful decorations
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>However, I mistook this sword for another sword...
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Hey, peddler! <cf>What happened to the sword I ordered!
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
<cf>No way, they didn't mean to trick you by selling cheap stuff, were you?
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
<cf>If you don't make it in time for the ceremony, you'll be putting mud on the face of the god of Bavaria!
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
There is no end in sight! <cf>There was just a slight mistake!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_guard_common
The sword you ordered will be delivered right away! <cf>Please wait just a little longer
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_guard_common
The time we can really wait is limited. <cf>God has seen everything
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
Lies and deception don't work! <cf>Be prepared if you don't make it in time!
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
It's been this way the whole time. <cf>It's a sword used for ceremonies, so people in the religious group are also nervous
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
We must quickly collect the “Ritual Sword Sword”!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
The other mismatched sword was ordered by an adventurer. <cf>I think I'll go meet that person now
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
However, that adventurer said he was heading to <cf>“Galley Ridge Abandoned Road”
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Isn't that area dangerous? <cf>I'm the only one, not really, but I can't move
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
That's why I want you to escort me. I want you to help me until I collect the <cf>sword
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
I'll do the negotiations, so please take care
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>I gave the misunderstood “Ritual Sword Sword” to the adventurer. Let's collect it right away
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>They said they were heading to “Galley Ridge Abandoned Road,” so I'm going to ask for an escort
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
I want you to help me until I finish collecting my sword. <cf>Please, take care
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Oh, they're in the same business, aren't they? Are you <cf>exploring this area too?
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
huh? <cf>I have a feeling the merchant over there looks familiar
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I'm glad I found it! <cf>I've been looking for you!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_Adventurer
They sold “ceremonial swords,” right? <cf>Oh, I mistook it for the real item
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_Adventurer
Oh, I see! I thought it was an <cf>awfully splendid sword for the price
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
Did they come to collect it by any chance?
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
That's right. <cf>I use it for Bavarian ceremonies, so I have to deliver it right away
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_Adventurer
ah ah... I'm sorry about that. I don't think I can <cf>return that sword
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
Do you know Tom Dorm's Hidden Mine? It's been said that the <cf>bandit's hidden treasure is sleeping
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
<cf>I also came here looking for that treasure, but when I went for a preliminary inspection, I had a mess
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
<cf>I was hit by a surprise attack by Flame Lapis and I dropped my sword and it ended
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
Yes, that's it! <cf>So you think “ceremonial swords” are within the territory of Flame Lapis?
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_Adventurer
That's what it is. With my <cf>ability, I'll do my best to run away
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
<cf>I lost my weapon too, and I was just trying to get back on my feet
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
Nonetheless, is it related to Bavarian rites? If you're not good at it, you<cf>'re likely to get mad at me too
S
Npc_Adventurer
Npc_Bessemer
hey, you. <cf>Can you bring back the “ceremonial sword costume”?
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
It's definitely better for you to go than me, who is unarmed. Seemingly, <cf>it looks like your arms stand a lot longer than me
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I'll ask for it too! <cf>The cult won't wait any longer!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
You're the only one I can count on! I want them to <cf>bring back “Ritual Sword Masquerade”!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
that's a rule. <cf>Flame Lapis should be found in “Tomdrum's Hidden Mine and Investigation”
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
<cf>If you make it all the way to the bottom, you'll be able to recover “ceremonial swords”
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
I'm going to escort this merchant to Lalpal. I asked you to <cf>take care of the sword!
S
Npc_Adventurer
Player
<cf>It looks like if you go to “Tomdrum's Hidden Mine and Investigation,” you'll find Flame Lapis
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
I want them to bring back “Ritual Sword Masquerade”!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
I'll go back to Lalpal first. <cf>If you can collect it, you should come right away too!
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Thank you, Adventurer! You collected the <cf>“Ritual Sword Sword”
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Yes, it's definitely this sword. <cf>Now we can finally deliver
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Oh, that's a great sword! It was worth the <cf>order
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
I'm sorry for your concern. <cf>Please pay
S
Npc_Bessemer
Npc_guard_common
Hmm, certainly. <cf>The god of Bavaria will also be delighted
S
Npc_guard_common
Npc_Bessemer
The adventurers there had a hard time too. <cf>Well, I'm getting ready for the ceremony, so with this
S
Npc_guard_common
Player
Huh, that was great. What would have <cf>happened without you
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
It would be nice if the people in the religious community would work a little bit too. <cf>Let me say thank you again
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>It's thanks to you that I didn't have to be disrespectful to the god of Bavaria
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>There are probably many ways of thinking, but after all, I respect God
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>Besides, it's an honor for a merchant to get an inquiry from a religious organization, isn't it
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
Thank you so much. I'll be very careful from <cf>now on
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>It's an honor for a merchant to get an inquiry from the Bavarian Order
S
Npc_Bessemer
Player
<cf>There are a lot of things I have to be careful about, but I'm still happy to be able to help God

Furthermore, the package has been broken in quite a messy manner...
N

Just in case, it might be better to report it. Let's collect the <cf>luggage tags
N
Npc_information
Npc_information
ah! Adventurer, that luggage tag! <cf>Could you show it to me?
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Lalpal's Merchants Association and Bureau of Reclamation... <cf>Both marks are on it, aren't they? where did this come from?
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
In “[Tsukikaku (Tsukikaku)] Shino [Yukoku (Yukoku)]” by [Outer Continent (Outer Continent)]? <cf>why on earth is it in such a place...
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Um, adventurer. <cf>I have a request, could you listen to me?
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>This package was prepared jointly by the merchants in Lalpal and the Bureau of Development
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>The contents are called “star sea silver,” which is a special type of silver used in festivals of the Bavarian Order
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Each grain resonates with the stars in the sky. It's a rare ore with <cf>such a legend
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
It was robbed during transportation
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>According to the merchant who was victimized, it is said that the culprit was a very powerful armed group
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>For bandits, they were able to take command, yet their modus operandi was extremely aggressive
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>And, strangely enough, it seems that they didn't even look at money or goods other than “Seikai Gin.”
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>The Bureau of Reclamation was also following my footsteps, but I can't believe it was being transported to [the Outer Continent (Gaitairiku)]...
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Anyway, “Seikai Gin” must be taken back. <cf>Please lend me Adventurer's help
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Let's head to Jubilee first. <cf>We gather information over there and establish policies
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
The package that was stolen was “Seikai Gin.” robbed by a <cf>vicious armed group
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>I don't know why it was transported to [the Outer Continent (Great Continent)], but in any case it is necessary to get it back
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Let's head to Jubilee first. <cf>I'm heading to the site too. regards
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Thank you for your hard work, adventurer. I asked the local people about the whereabouts of <cf>“Star Sea Silver”
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>It was a reasonably large package, and it seems like there were people who saw it
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>Conversely, it means they carried stolen goods in a dignified manner without worrying about being visible to the public eye...
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
The destination of the armed group seems to be a place called <cf>“Kahuna's [cave (look)]”
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>The place where the adventurer found his luggage was close to that, wasn't it? There's no doubt
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>However, it seems that no such group has been seen in the “Kahuna's [crow (look)]” area since then
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
I wonder if they've already disappeared...
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>Adventurer, can you recover “Starry Sea Silver” by carrying out “Kahuna's [Holes (Look)] Additional Investigations”?
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Sorry, I can't help you in battle. <cf>Also, there's something I'm a little worried about
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
“Kahuna's [cave (look)]” is one of the sacred places for belief in the <cf>[god of the sea (wadatsumi)] remaining in this land
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>Also, “star sea silver” is a special metal used for festivals in the Bavarian religion
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>It is said that once upon a time, a Bavarian priest attempted to hear the voice of God in heaven through “Starry Sea Silver.”
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>It's just a legend, but it's also true that it's still handed down as a religious festival
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
does it have anything to do with armed groups... <cf>It's just my imagination, but I'll look it up
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Please do an additional investigation of Kahuna's [hole (look)]. <cf>If there is a danger, never overdo it
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
If I could get “Star Sea Silver” back, that would be enough
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
The armed group that robbed “Star Sea Silver” seems to have headed to <cf>“Kahuna's [Cave (look)]”
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>I think we can recover “Star Sea Silver” if “Kahuna's [hole (look)] additional investigation” is carried out
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>The armed group hasn't shown up since, and they may have already fled
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Adventurers, don't overdo it either. If you decide it's <cf>dangerous, please pull it up
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Welcome back, Adventurer! Thank <cf>you for your hard work on the investigation of “Kahuna's [hole (look)]”
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Oh, this is “Seikai Gin,” isn't it? There's no doubt that it <cf>was taken
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
That was great. <cf>Did you find any other clues?
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
I don't know the details... <cf>Understood, thank you
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Let's stop tracking any further. <cf>I'll post a detailed report to the Bureau of Development
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Who was aiming for what? <cf>I can't get rid of the creepy feeling, but...
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>I was also taught a lot by the people in the village
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
It seems that kahuna in “kahuna's [cave (look)]” is like a priest or shrine maiden in the <cf>[sea god (wadatsumi)] faith
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
Also, at the back of “Kahuna's [cave (look)],” there is an even more important sacred place called “[Wadatsumi no Iwaya (Wadatsumi no Iwaya)],” <cf>which is an even more important sacred place
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>It is said that kahuna have made offerings to that place since ancient times, and sometimes delivered the voice of [Wadatsumi (Wadatsumi)] to people
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
It's similar to the legend of “Hoshimi Gin,” isn't it
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
<cf>Did the culprits use “Star Sea Silver” in a sacred place to listen to someone's voice?
N
Npc_Cecile
Player
I'm sorry. <cf>Even if we talk here, it's not beyond your imagination
N
Npc_Cecile
Player

Jubilia and Asterlies can be carried by regular ferry, so that's a relief.

This is a bustling town, unlike The Life of the Forest People.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
:
I may not be used to living room here, but I love visiting.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Well, my way of thinking would make me an oddball even among the forest people.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Hello, I'm Kaponono. <cf>I'm a forest dweller living room in Jubilia.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I come to Asterlies courtesy by regular ferry.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I came here today because I wanted to try fishing.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I Took Friends with an Adventurer Who Came to Jubilia Some Time Ago, and Received the Thoughts of Bafaria.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
It grilled to be boiled for grilled fish. <cf>However, I have no experience in fishing.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
What do you think? As an Adventurer, do you have any ideas?
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Hmm, does that make sense? <cf>It would be helpful if someone with more knowledge could help me.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Oh, it's rare to see a forest folk fisherman. <cf>What a nice encounter!
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
I'm Andor I'm excited to promote fishing. <cf>If you have any questions, I'll be happy to help you.
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
I thought that. <cf>Inherited, I inherited this Buffalia from a friend.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Npc_Andoohl
I heard it's fishing for fishing, but I don't know how to use it.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Npc_Andoohl
Hmm, can I have a look? <cf>Let's see...
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
It feels like to be a kind of lure. <cf>It's called a fake bait.
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
Oh, it's a fake thing made to look like bait. <cf>I Hear Good Anglers use it to trick fish into killing them.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Npc_Andoohl
Yes! More, this legacy shampoo to make the lure move by shampoo.
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
Slowly just throw it into the ocean and it will move just as well as the real thing!
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
Oh. So, <cf>can you catch fish without using bait?
@
Npc_Kaponono
Npc_Andoohl
That's true, but it's pretty worn out. <cf>It would be better to repair it.
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
I think using 'Ptarmigan Feathers' will give you a great finish!
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
The “Prairie Feather” is the material for Lightning Pecker. <cf>It should be in “Tsukikakushi's Yūkoku”
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I'm sorry to say you, but <cf>could you please gather about the four of them?
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I received it from a human friend. <cf>I want to use it in a proper way.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
It helps that a “Prairie Feather” is needed to repair the Bafaria Relic.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
You should be able to get it from Lightning Pecker in Tsukikakushi's Yukoku.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I'm sorry to hate you, but <cf>I was sorry if you could collect about four of them. Thank you
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Hi, thank you. <cf>You Showed the “Ptarmigan Showers” for me.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Lightning peckers live on land, but their fans are busy for fishing. It's strange.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Hey, welcome back! <cf>It looks like you've worn all the materials clothes.
@
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Well then, let's repair Mr. Kaponono's Legacy. <cf>Leave it to me!
@
Npc_Andoohl
Player
Okay, this is good! <cf>I also prepared a fishing rod.
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
I hope you enjoy fishing to the fullest! <cf>I'm sure your friends will be happy too!
@
Npc_Andoohl
Npc_Kaponono
Thank you for everything. <cf>It was nice to meet such a kind person.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Some of the forest people don't like to associate with relatives.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I feel like I've been tired with good feelings with my friends and with you guys.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
While casting my fishing line, I think back on the people I've met.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
If you meet the forest people, please approach them. <cf>They are just not used to human kindness.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Fishing is deep. <cf>And it allows you to interact with many people.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
I've made a lot of friends who are also fishermen. <cf>There's No Longer between Thrives and Forest People.
@
Npc_Kaponono
Player
Yes, I'm glad I started. <cf>Why don't you try fishing once in a while?

THE REASON WHY I CALL MYSELF THE ONE-MAN ARMY!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
But I can't reveal it so bad! <cf>You know that, don't you?
8
Npc_Mino
Player
The battle site is “Tsukikakushi no Yuukoku”! <cf>Stuck the Monsters are there.
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Gilmy Shaman and Gilmy Sage. <cf>Try defeating them together!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
I chose 14 of each! <cf>You Can't Beat Me Unless You Hate 15 of Them!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Ha, facing two types at once is truly a one-man army! I'm tired of myself.
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Let's begin! The strong sit and wait! <cf>I'm Awaiting the Wrath of Your Battle!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
“Let's fight the monsters in the [Hidden Moon Valley]! <cf>Our targets are Gilmy Shaman and Gilmy Sage!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Can you beat 15 of them? <cf>If you can, you win!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Ha, taking on both at the same time <cf>is truly the image of a one-man army!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
<span size="Big">Wh, what?! </>
8
Npc_Mino
Player
YOU'VE JUST JUST THE GUILMIES?! <cf>That's stupid, it's too early!!

Hold on! I'll check!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Whew... whew... It was really busy. <cf>Sorry, I doubted you.
8
Npc_Mino
Player
You're amazing! Gilmy Shaman and Sage, <cf>you have 15 of them together!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
You truly are a one-man army! <cf>A Solitary Warrior Who Can Fight Alone!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
I'm alone too. <cf>I was proud to bear this name.
8
Npc_Mino
Player
One Man Can Fight Like An Army! <cf>One man and an army! That's me!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
If I had been a one-man army back then, <cf>hungry, hungry puppies would have been...
8
Npc_Mino
Player
No, nothing! <cf>ONE-MAN ARMY IS THE SYMBOL OF ATTENTION! No regrets!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
BUT A ONE-MAN ARMY DOESN'T NEED TWO PEOPLE. <cf>After all, it's a one-man army.
8
Npc_Mino
Player
If there were two of us, the sign would be a lie. <cf>I'll gladly hand over the position of one-man army to you!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
My Power was not enough. <cf>Your favorite matches to be in a different league!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
As expected! YOU CAN FIGHT THROUGH EVEN ALONE <cf>YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR OWN HORIZONS!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Well, farewell! I won't lose next time! <cf>Persevere in solitude and isolation, my rival!
8
Npc_Mino
Player
The Change of Environment in the [Outer Spaces] has been a good training.
8
Npc_Mino
Player
Let's try changing it a bit more. <cf>Let's go deep into the bathtub!
